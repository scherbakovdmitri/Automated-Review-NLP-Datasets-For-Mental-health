Characteristics of and Variation in Suicide Mortality Related to Retirement During the Great Recession: Perspectives From the National Violent Death Reporting System,"Ananthasubramaniam, A.; Jurgens, D.; Kahsay, E.; Mezuk, B.","Background and Objectives: Suicide rates typically increase during recessions. However, few studies have explored how recessions affect risk among older adults nearing retirement. This study used a large suicide mortality registry to characterize and quantify suicide related to retirement during the Great Recession (GR). Research Design and Methods: Data come from the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS, 2004-2017; N = 53,298 suicide deaths age ≥50). We analyzed the text narratives (i.e., descriptions of the most salient circumstances to each suicide) of these decedents using natural language processing (NLP) to identify cases that were ""retirement-related""(RR, e.g., anticipating, being unable to, or recently retiring). We used time-series analysis to quantify variation in RR over the GR, and compared these trends to retirees (i.e., decedents whose occupation was ""retired"") and all decedents aged ≥50. We used content and network analysis to characterize themes represented in the narratives. Results: There were 878 RR cases (1.6% of suicides aged ≥50) identified by the NLP model; only 52% of these cases were among retirees. RR cases were younger (62 vs 75 years) and more educated (41.5% vs 24.5% college degree) than retirees. The rate of RR suicide was positively associated with indicators of the GR (e.g., short-term unemployment R2 = 0.70, p = .024), but economic indicators were not correlated with the suicide rate among retirees or older adults in general. Economic issues were more central to the narratives of RR cases during the GR compared to other periods. Discussion and Implications: Recessions shape suicide risk related to retirement transitions.  © 2024 The Author(s).",2024,,Gerontologist,64,6,,,10.1093/geront/gnae015,,#2,Ananthasubramaniam 2024,"",""
AI and narrative embeddings detect PTSD following childbirth via birth stories,"Bartal, A.; Jagodnik, K.M.; Chan, S.J.; Dekel, S.","Free-text analysis using machine learning (ML)-based natural language processing (NLP) shows promise for diagnosing psychiatric conditions. Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) has demonstrated preliminary initial feasibility for this purpose; however, whether it can accurately assess mental illness remains to be determined. This study evaluates the effectiveness of ChatGPT and the text-embedding-ada-002 (ADA) model in detecting post-traumatic stress disorder following childbirth (CB-PTSD), a maternal postpartum mental illness affecting millions of women annually, with no standard screening protocol. Using a sample of 1295 women who gave birth in the last six months and were 18+ years old, recruited through hospital announcements, social media, and professional organizations, we explore ChatGPT’s and ADA’s potential to screen for CB-PTSD by analyzing maternal childbirth narratives. The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5; cutoff 31) was used to assess CB-PTSD. By developing an ML model that utilizes numerical vector representation of the ADA model, we identify CB-PTSD via narrative classification. Our model outperformed (F1 score: 0.81) ChatGPT and six previously published large text-embedding models trained on mental health or clinical domains data, suggesting that the ADA model can be harnessed to identify CB-PTSD. Our modeling approach could be generalized to assess other mental health disorders. © The Author(s) 2024.",2024,,Scientific Reports,14,1,,,10.1038/s41598-024-54242-2,,#6,Bartal 2024,"",""
Research and Development of a Modern Deep Learning Model for Emotional Analysis Management of Text Data,"Bashynska, I.; Sarafanov, M.; Manikaeva, O.","There are many ways people express their reactions in the media. Text data is one of them, for example, comments, reviews, blog posts, messages, etc. Analysis of emotions expressed there is in high demand nowadays for various purposes. This research provides a method of performing sentiment analysis of text information using machine learning. The authors trained a classifier based on the BERT encoder, which recognizes emotions in text messages in English written in chat style. To handle raw chat-style messages, authors developed an enhanced text standardization layer. The list of emotions identified includes admiration, amusement, anger, annoyance, approval, caring, confusion, curiosity, desire, disappointment, disapproval, disgust, embarrassment, excitement, fear, gratitude, grief, joy, love, nervousness, optimism, pride, realization, relief, remorse, sadness, and surprise. The model solves the problem of multiclass multilabel text classification, which means that more than one class can be predicted from one piece of text. The authors trained the model on the GoEmotions dataset, which consists of 54,263 text comments from Reddit. The model reached a macro-averaged F1-Score of 0.50704 in emotions prediction and 0.7349 in sentiments prediction on the testing dataset. The presented model increased the quality of emotions prediction by 10.2% and sentiments prediction by 6.5% in comparison to the baseline approach. © 2024 by the authors.",2024,,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),14,5,,,10.3390/app14051952,,#8,Bashynska 2024,"",""
A machine learning approach to detect potentially harmful and protective suiciderelated content in broadcast media,"Metzler, H.; Baginski, H.; Garcia, D.; Niederkrotenthaler, T.","Suicide-related media content has preventive or harmful effects depending on the specific content. Proactive media screening for suicide prevention is hampered by the scarcity of machine learning approaches to detect specific characteristics in news reports. This study applied machine learning to label large quantities of broadcast (TV and radio) media data according to media recommendations reporting suicide. We manually labeled 2519 English transcripts from 44 broadcast sources in Oregon and Washington, USA, published between April 2019 and March 2020. We conducted a content analysis of media reports regarding content characteristics. We trained a benchmark of machine learning models including a majority classifier, approaches based on word frequency (TF-IDF with a linear SVM) and a deep learning model (BERT). We applied these models to a selection of more simple (e.g., focus on a suicide death), and subsequently to putatively more complex tasks (e.g., determining the main focus of a text from 14 categories). Tf-idf with SVM and BERT were clearly better than the naive majority classifier for all characteristics. In a test dataset not used during model training, F1-scores (i.e., the harmonic mean of precision and recall) ranged from 0.90 for celebrity suicide down to 0.58 for the identification of the main focus of the media item. Model performance depended strongly on the number of training samples available, and much less on assumed difficulty of the classification task. This study demonstrates that machine learning models can achieve very satisfactory results for classifying suicide-related broadcast media content, including multi-class characteristics, as long as enough training samples are available. The developed models enable future large-scale screening and investigations of broadcast media.  © 2024 Metzler et al.

Predicting recurrent chat contact in a psychological intervention for the youth using natural language processing,"Hornstein, S.; Scharfenberger, J.; Lueken, U.; Wundrack, R.; Hilbert, K.","Chat-based counseling hotlines emerged as a promising low-threshold intervention for youth mental health. However, despite the resulting availability of large text corpora, little work has investigated Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications within this setting. Therefore, this preregistered approach (OSF: XA4PN) utilizes a sample of approximately 19,000 children and young adults that received a chat consultation from a 24/7 crisis service in Germany. Around 800,000 messages were used to predict whether chatters would contact the service again, as this would allow the provision of or redirection to additional treatment. We trained an XGBoost Classifier on the words of the anonymized conversations, using repeated cross-validation and bayesian optimization for hyperparameter search. The best model was able to achieve an AUROC score of 0.68 (p < 0.01) on the previously unseen 3942 newest consultations. A shapely-based explainability approach revealed that words indicating younger age or female gender and terms related to self-harm and suicidal thoughts were associated with a higher chance of recontacting. We conclude that NLP-based predictions of recurrent contact are a promising path toward personalized care at chat hotlines. © The Author(s) 2024.",2024,,npj Digital Medicine,7,1,,,10.1038/s41746-024-01121-9,,#15,Hornstein 2024,"",""
Text classification models for personality disorders identification,"Jain, D.; Arora, S.; Jha, C.K.; Malik, G.","This research focuses on identifying personality disorders in individuals using their social media text. We developed a unique collection of words (PD-Corpus) and a dataset (PD-TXT), which includes texts marked with different personality disorder traits. Our goal was to classify these texts into six types of personality disorders, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) classification models. The results showed that our transformer-based models, especially the BERT-base-uncased model, were more effective than traditional methods, achieving a 74.7% success rate in correctly classifying these disorders. Also, our models consistently outperform existing literature baseline models on the PD-TXT dataset, showcasing significant enhancements.

Longitudinal observational cohort study: Speech for Intelligent cognition change tracking and DEtection of Alzheimer’s Disease (SIDE-AD),"Saunders, S.; Haider, F.; Ritchie, C.W.; Terrera, G.M.; Luz, S.","Introduction There is emerging evidence that speech may be a potential indicator and manifestation of early Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. Therefore, the University of Edinburgh and Sony Research have partnered to create the Speech for Intelligent cognition change tracking and DEtection of Alzheimer’s Disease (SIDE-AD) study, which aims to develop digital speech-based biomarkers for use in neurodegenerative disease. Methods and analysis SIDE-AD is an observational longitudinal study, collecting samples of spontaneous speech. Participants are recruited from existing cohort studies as well as from the National Health Service (NHS) memory clinics in Scotland. Using an online platform, participants record a voice sample talking about their brain health and rate their mood, anxiety and apathy. The speech biomarkers will be analysed longitudinally, and we will use machine learning and natural language processing technology to automate the assessment of the respondents’ speech patterns. Ethics and dissemination The SIDE-AD study has been approved by the NHS Research Ethics Committee (REC reference: 23/WM/0153, protocol number AC23046, IRAS Project ID 323311) and received NHS management approvals from Lothian, Fife and Forth Valley NHS boards. Our main ethical considerations pertain to the remote administration of the study, such as taking remote consent. To address this, we implemented a consent process, whereby the first step of the consent is done entirely remotely but a member of the research team contacts the participant over the phone to consent participants to the optional, most sensitive, elements of the study. Results will be presented at conferences, published in peer-reviewed journals and communicated to study participants. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.",2024,,BMJ Open,14,3,,,10.1136/bmjopen-2023-082388,,#18,Saunders 2024,"",""
Development of intelligent system based on synthesis of affective signals and deep neural networks to foster mental health of the Indian virtual community,"Arora, M.K.; Singh, J.; Singh, A.","Social network analytics in health-care is recently catching-all as world is recovering from Covid-19 pandemic and when it comes to dealing with mounting mental health problems in the online community. A technical breakthrough to quickly address this issue is a big bet on researchers to deliver better intelligent mental health scale and support in mental distress risk management. In this paper we aim to build four artificial-intelligence driven models by blending the power of two dominant deep learning neural networks for explaining and predicting mental distress risk in the crowd-sourced online community. The models are simulated using a novel feature construct, which is a combination of numerical and textual data. The numerical data are realized by encoding social networking sites behavior and physical, social, cognitive experiences as part of three axes of psychological distress (depression, anxiety and stress). The textual part of data is made up of social network comments mined to acquire mental distressed cues by applying feature extraction techniques such as word embeddings and glove embeddings techniques. With the hyper-parameter tuning of models, we attained excellent performance (accuracy ~ 99.20%) which proves the efficacy of the proposed hybrid mental distress prediction model well with respect to accuracy in comparison to other related recent existing models with a boost of 0.20%. Our experimental results offer a robust model wherein we achieved zero false positive cases, attained 100% precision and excellent F1 measures. Additionally, we validated our results by using state-of-the-art technique BERT on different ground truth dataset i.e., Indian tweets to explore the tweets for psychological-distress prediction. Thus, we present an effectual automated tool for treatment activation of mental distress and supporting decisions in fostering the mental health of online society. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",2024,,Social Network Analysis and Mining,14,1,,,10.1007/s13278-023-01179-5,,#25,Arora 2024,"",""
Disease progression strikingly differs in research and real-world Parkinson’s populations,"Beaulieu-Jones, B.K.; Frau, F.; Bozzi, S.; Chandross, K.J.; Peterschmitt, M.J.; Cohen, C.; Coulovrat, C.; Kumar, D.; Kruger, M.J.; Lipnick, S.L.; Fitzsimmons, L.; Kohane, I.S.; Scherzer, C.R.","Characterization of Parkinson’s disease (PD) progression using real-world evidence could guide clinical trial design and identify subpopulations. Efforts to curate research populations, the increasing availability of real-world data, and advances in natural language processing, particularly large language models, allow for a more granular comparison of populations than previously possible. This study includes two research populations and two real-world data-derived (RWD) populations. The research populations are the Harvard Biomarkers Study (HBS, N = 935), a longitudinal biomarkers cohort study with in-person structured study visits; and Fox Insights (N = 36,660), an online self-survey-based research study of the Michael J. Fox Foundation. Real-world cohorts are the Optum Integrated Claims-electronic health records (N = 157,475), representing wide-scale linked medical and claims data and de-identified data from Mass General Brigham (MGB, N = 22,949), an academic hospital system. Structured, de-identified electronic health records data at MGB are supplemented using a manually validated natural language processing with a large language model to extract measurements of PD progression. Motor and cognitive progression scores change more rapidly in MGB than HBS (median survival until H&Y 3: 5.6 years vs. >10, p < 0.001; mini-mental state exam median decline 0.28 vs. 0.11, p < 0.001; and clinically recognized cognitive decline, p = 0.001). In real-world populations, patients are diagnosed more than eleven years later (RWD mean of 72.2 vs. research mean of 60.4, p < 0.001). After diagnosis, in real-world cohorts, treatment with PD medications has initiated an average of 2.3 years later (95% CI: [2.1–2.4]; p < 0.001). This study provides a detailed characterization of Parkinson’s progression in diverse populations. It delineates systemic divergences in the patient populations enrolled in research settings vs. patients in the real-world. These divergences are likely due to a combination of selection bias and real population differences, but exact attribution of the causes is challenging.

Foresight—a generative pretrained transformer for modelling of patient timelines using electronic health records: a retrospective modelling study,"Kraljevic, Z.; Bean, D.; Shek, A.; Bendayan, R.; Hemingway, H.; Yeung, J.A.; Deng, A.; Baston, A.; Ross, J.; Idowu, E.; Teo, J.T.; Dobson, R.J.B.","Background: An electronic health record (EHR) holds detailed longitudinal information about a patient's health status and general clinical history, a large portion of which is stored as unstructured, free text. Existing approaches to model a patient's trajectory focus mostly on structured data and a subset of single-domain outcomes. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of Foresight, a generative transformer in temporal modelling of patient data, integrating both free text and structured formats, to predict a diverse array of future medical outcomes, such as disorders, substances (eg, to do with medicines, allergies, or poisonings), procedures, and findings (eg, relating to observations, judgements, or assessments). Methods: Foresight is a novel transformer-based pipeline that uses named entity recognition and linking tools to convert EHR document text into structured, coded concepts, followed by providing probabilistic forecasts for future medical events, such as disorders, substances, procedures, and findings. The Foresight pipeline has four main components: (1) CogStack (data retrieval and preprocessing); (2) the Medical Concept Annotation Toolkit (structuring of the free-text information from EHRs); (3) Foresight Core (deep-learning model for biomedical concept modelling); and (4) the Foresight web application. We processed the entire free-text portion from three different hospital datasets (King's College Hospital [KCH], South London and Maudsley [SLaM], and the US Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III [MIMIC-III]), resulting in information from 811 336 patients and covering both physical and mental health institutions. We measured the performance of models using custom metrics derived from precision and recall. Findings: Foresight achieved a precision@10 (ie, of 10 forecasted candidates, at least one is correct) of 0·68 (SD 0·0027) for the KCH dataset, 0·76 (0·0032) for the SLaM dataset, and 0·88 (0·0018) for the MIMIC-III dataset, for forecasting the next new disorder in a patient timeline. Foresight also achieved a precision@10 value of 0·80 (0·0013) for the KCH dataset, 0·81 (0·0026) for the SLaM dataset, and 0·91 (0·0011) for the MIMIC-III dataset, for forecasting the next new biomedical concept. In addition, Foresight was validated on 34 synthetic patient timelines by five clinicians and achieved a relevancy of 33 (97% [95% CI 91–100]) of 34 for the top forecasted candidate disorder. As a generative model, Foresight can forecast follow-on biomedical concepts for as many steps as required. Interpretation: Foresight is a general-purpose model for biomedical concept modelling that can be used for real-world risk forecasting, virtual trials, and clinical research to study the progression of disorders, to simulate interventions and counterfactuals, and for educational purposes.

Benchmarking Cyber Harassment Dialogue Comprehension through Emotion-Informed Manifestations-Determinants Demarcation,"Ghosh, S.; Singh, G.V.; Arora, J.; Ekbal, A.","In the digital age, cybercrimes, particularly cyber harassment, have become pressing issues, targeting vulnerable individuals like children, teenagers, and women. Understanding the experiences and needs of the victims is crucial for effective support and intervention. Online conversations between victims and virtual harassment counselors (chatbots) offer valuable insights into cyber harassment manifestations (CHMs) and determinants (CHDs). However, the distinction between CHMs and CHDs remains unclear. This research is the first to introduce concrete definitions for CHMs and CHDs, investigating their distinction through automated methods to enable efficient cyber-harassment dialogue comprehension. We present a novel dataset, Cyber-MaD that contains Cyber harassment dialogues manually annotated with Manifestations and Determinants. Additionally, we design an Emotioninformed Contextual Dual attention Convolution Transformer (E-ConDuCT) framework to extract CHMs and CHDs from cyber harassment dialogues. The framework primarily: a) utilizes inherent emotion features through adjective-noun pairs modeled by an autoencoder, b) employs a unique Contextual Dual attention Convolution Transformer to learn contextual insights; and c) incorporates a demarcation module leveraging task-specific emotional knowledge and a discriminator loss function to differentiate manifestations and determinants. E-ConDuCT outperforms the state-of-the-art systems on the Cyber-MaD corpus, showcasing its potential in the extraction of CHMs and CHDs. Furthermore, its robustness is demonstrated on the emotion cause extraction task using the CARES CEASE-v2.0 dataset of suicide notes, confirming its efficacy across diverse cause extraction objectives. © 2024, Association for the Advancement of Artifcial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

"Paving the way for COVID survivors’ psychosocial rehabilitation: Mining topics, sentiments, and their trajectories over time from Reddit","Farokhnia Hamedani, M.; Esmaeili, M.; Sun, Y.; Sheybani, E.; Javidi, G.","Objective: This study examined major themes and sentiments and their trajectories and interactions over time using subcategories of Reddit data. The aim was to facilitate decision-making for psychosocial rehabilitation. Materials and Methods: We utilized natural language processing techniques, including topic modeling and sentiment analysis, on a dataset consisting of more than 38,000 topics, comments, and posts collected from a subreddit dedicated to the experiences of people who tested positive for COVID-19. In this longitudinal exploratory analysis, we studied the dynamics between the most dominant topics and subjects’ emotional states over an 18-month period. Results: Our findings highlight the evolution of the textual and sentimental status of major topics discussed by COVID survivors over an extended period of time during the pandemic. We particularly studied pre- and post-vaccination eras as a turning point in the timeline of the pandemic. The results show that not only does the relevance of topics change over time, but the emotions attached to them also vary. Major social events, such as the administration of vaccines or enforcement of nationwide policies, are also reflected through the discussions and inquiries of social media users. In particular, the emotional state (i.e., sentiments and polarity of their feelings) of those who have experienced COVID personally. Discussion: Cumulative societal knowledge regarding the COVID-19 pandemic impacts the patterns with which people discuss their experiences, concerns, and opinions. The subjects’ emotional state with respect to different topics was also impacted by extraneous factors and events, such as vaccination. Conclusion: By mining major topics, sentiments, and trajectories demonstrated in COVID-19 survivors’ interactions on Reddit, this study contributes to the emerging body of scholarship on COVID-19 survivors’ mental health outcomes, providing insights into the design of mental health support and rehabilitation services for COVID-19 survivors. © The Author(s) 2024.",2024,,Health Informatics Journal,30,2,,,10.1177/14604582241240680,,#32,FarokhniaHamedani 2024,"",""
M3BAT: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Multimodal Mobile Sensing with Multi-Branch Adversarial Training,"Meegahapola, L.; Hassoune, H.; Gatica-Perez, D.","Over the years, multimodal mobile sensing has been used extensively for inferences regarding health and well-being, behavior, and context. However, a significant challenge hindering the widespread deployment of such models in real-world scenarios is the issue of distribution shift. This is the phenomenon where the distribution of data in the training set differs from the distribution of data in the real world - -the deployment environment. While extensively explored in computer vision and natural language processing, and while prior research in mobile sensing briefly addresses this concern, current work primarily focuses on models dealing with a single modality of data, such as audio or accelerometer readings, and consequently, there is little research on unsupervised domain adaptation when dealing with multimodal sensor data. To address this gap, we did extensive experiments with domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) showing that they can effectively handle distribution shifts in multimodal sensor data. Moreover, we proposed a novel improvement over DANN, called M3BAT, unsupervised domain adaptation for multimodal mobile sensing with multi-branch adversarial training, to account for the multimodality of sensor data during domain adaptation with multiple branches. Through extensive experiments conducted on two multimodal mobile sensing datasets, three inference tasks, and 14 source-target domain pairs, including both regression and classification, we demonstrate that our approach performs effectively on unseen domains. Compared to directly deploying a model trained in the source domain to the target domain, the model shows performance increases up to 12% AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristics curves) on classification tasks, and up to 0.13 MAE (mean absolute error) on regression tasks.  © 2024 ACM.",2024,,"Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies",8,2,,,10.1145/3659591,,#35,Meegahapola 2024,"",""
Potential cyberbullying detection in social media platforms based on a multi-task learning framework,"Xingyi, G.; Adnan, H.M.","The proliferation of online violence has given rise to a spate of malignant incidents, necessitating a renewed focus on the identification of cyberbullying comments. Text classification lies at the heart of efforts to tackle this pernicious problem. The identification of cyberbullying comments presents unique challenges that call for innovative solutions. In contrast to traditional text classification tasks, cyberbullying comments are often accompanied by subtle and arbitrary expressions that can confound even the most sophisticated classification networks, resulting in low recognition accuracy and effectiveness. To address this challenge, a novel approach is proposed that leverages the BERT pre-training model for word embedding to retain the hidden semantic information in the text. Building on this foundation, the BiSRU++ model which combines attentional mecha-nisms is used to further extract contextual features of comments. A multi-task learning framework is employed for joint training of sentiment analysis and cyberbullying detection to improve the model's classification accuracy and generalization ability. The proposed model is no longer en-tirely reliant on a sensitive word dictionary, and experimental results demonstrate its ability to better understand semantic information compared to traditional models, facilitating the identification of potential online cyberbullying comments. © 2024 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.",2024,,International Journal of Data and Network Science,8,1,25-34,,10.5267/j.ijdns.2023.10.021,,#38,Xingyi 2024,"",""

Outgroup Dehumanisation in Telegram – the Role of Ingroup Identity and Perception,"Chernenko, E.","Intergroup dehumanisation represents a pressing concern for today’s society. It hinders empathy, prosocial behaviour, and contributes to between-group aggression. Its consequences are particularly dangerous in the context of international military conflicts as dehumanisation contributes to support for war, war-related violence, and usually accompanies genocidal conflicts. This motivated the focus of this study on the blatant forms of dehumanisation towards an outgroup defined in political or national terms, with a specific focus on the relations between Ukrainians, Russians, and Belarusians around the time of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The study draws attention to previously under-researched aspect in outgroup dehumanisation, specifically the role of ingroup perception in it. Outgroup dehumanisation involves excluding the outgroup from the community one identifies with, thus reinforcing the boundary between ingroup and outgroup. This highlights the comparative nature of dehumanisation, suggesting its basis might lie more in comparative ingroup superiority bias rather than in outgroup inferiority bias. Existing research however generally concentrates solely on negative aspects of outgroup perception in dehumanising attitudes. While some studies have gauged dehumanisation through ingroup-outgroup perception differences, they lacked a ground truth measure for dehumanisation, leaving its comparative nature largely unexamined. Employing generative Large Language Model, we develop a dataset of Telegram channels posts, classified as dehumanising or neutral. Utilising NLP tools we analyse the role of ingroup-outgroup perception disparities in dehumanisation, specifically addressing its relation to affective polarisation. © 2024 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).",2024,,WWW 2024 Companion - Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference,,,1202-1205,,10.1145/3589335.3651261,,#43,Chernenko 2024,"",""
TherapyBot: a chatbot for mental well-being using transformers,"Dharrao, D.; Gite, S.","The field of natural language processing (NLP) and conversational artificial intelligence (AI) has one ingenious application in the psychological space. Depression and anxiety are two major issues that the world is facing, with close to 41% of adults reporting these symptoms in the United States alone, as of December 2020. It has also been observed that most of the people are not open about it. As a result, it is critical to address this issue on a global scale. Developed countries reportedly have 9 psychiatrists per 100,000 people. One way to mitigate this is the use of chatbots. We propose a transformer-based methodology to build a therapy bot that has been trained on a combination of open-domain conversations from a publicly available dataset and therapist-client conversations from a self-constructed dataset. This end-to-end data-driven model shows quality performance in conversations and adds value by aiding in the case of mental health issues. The proposed architecture is proven to be effective in its usability in the psychological space for both single-turn and multi-turn dialogue.

“Transforming” Personality Scale Development: Illustrating the Potential of State-of-the-Art Natural Language Processing,"Fyffe, S.; Lee, P.; Kaplan, S.","Natural language processing (NLP) techniques are becoming increasingly popular in industrial and organizational psychology. One promising area for NLP-based applications is scale development; yet, while many possibilities exist, so far these applications have been restricted—mainly focusing on automated item generation. The current research expands this potential by illustrating an NLP-based approach to content analysis, which manually categorizes scale items by their measured constructs. In NLP, content analysis is performed as a text classification task whereby a model is trained to automatically assign scale items to the construct that they measure. Here, we present an approach to text classification—using state-of-the-art transformer models—that builds upon past approaches. We begin by introducing transformer models and their advantages over alternative methods. Next, we illustrate how to train a transformer to content analyze Big Five personality items. Then, we compare the models trained to human raters, finding that transformer models outperform human raters and several alternative models. Finally, we present practical considerations, limitations, and future research directions. © The Author(s) 2023.",2024,,Organizational Research Methods,27,2,265-300,,10.1177/10944281231155771,,#45,Fyffe 2024,"",""

Seeing and Thinking about Urban Blue–Green Space: Monitoring Public Landscape Preferences Using Bimodal Data,"Dao, C.; Qi, J.","Urban blue–green spaces (UBGSs) are a significant avenue for addressing the worldwide mental health crisis. To effectively optimise landscape design and management for the promotion of health benefits from UBGS, it is crucial to objectively understand public preferences. This paper proposes a method to evaluate public landscape preference from the perspective of seeing and thinking, takes the examples of seven parks around the Dianchi Lake in Kunming, China, and analyses the social media data by using natural language processing technology and image semantic segmentation technology. The conclusions are as follows: (1) The public exhibits significantly high positive sentiments towards various UBGSs, with over 93% of comments expressed positive sentiments. (2) Differences exist in the frequency and perception of landscape features between image and text modalities. Landscape elements related to stability are perceived more in images than in text, while dynamic and experiential elements are perceived more in text than in images. (3) In both modalities, the distinctive landscape features of parks are more frequently perceived and preferred by the public. In the end, the intrinsic links between landscape elements and public sentiment and preferences are discussed, and suggestions for design and management improvements are made to consolidate their health benefits to the public. © 2024 by the authors.",2024,,Buildings,14,5,,,10.3390/buildings14051426,,#47,Dao 2024,"",""
Hybrid machine learning models to detect signs of depression,"Khan, S.; Alqahtani, S.","Depression is a prevalent mental illness that can only be diagnosed through self-reporting. Unfortunately, 70% of individuals do not seek medical help in the early stages of depression. With the increasing use of social media to share daily activities and emotions, it has become a valuable tool for identifying mental health issues. To this end, this paper proposes multiple hybrid machine-learning models for sentiment analysis to detect signs of depression by analyzing Twitter tweets. The study utilizes unsupervised approaches for feature extraction and supervised approaches as classifiers. The proposed models are evaluated on public sentiment tweets datasets using various performance metrics. The four modules proposed in this study can be used to detect signs of depression in text data. Module 1 uses BERT for feature extraction followed by an artificial neural network as a classification module. Module 2 involves data pre-processing followed by the TF-IDF feature extraction method and logistic regression as a classification algorithm. Module 3 also includes data pre-processing followed by the TF-IDF feature extraction method but uses a linear support vector machine as the classification algorithm. Finally, Module 4 uses the Spacy package with a small library as the feature extraction method and a linear support vector machine as the classification algorithm. Model 2 had the highest accuracy of 0.994, followed closely by model 3 with an accuracy of 0.992, while model 4 had a significantly lower accuracy of 0.868.

Materials and Methods: Our platform uses state-of-the-art unsupervised natural language processing methods, building on top of a large language model, to analyze social media text data. At the center of the platform's functionality is BERTopic, which clusters social media posts, forming collections of words representing distinct topics. A key feature of our platform is its ability to identify whole sentences corresponding to topic words, vastly improving the platform's ability to perform downstream similarity operations with respect to a user-defined TOI. Results: Two case studies on mental health among university students are performed to demonstrate the utility of the platform, focusing on signals within social media (Reddit) data related to depression and their connection to various emergent themes within the data. Discussion and Conclusion: Our platform provides researchers with a readily available and inexpensive tool to parse large quantities of unstructured, noisy data into coherent themes, as well as identifying portions of the data related to the research TOI.

How to improve academic well-being: an analysis of the leveraging factors based on the Italian case,"Tontodimamma, A.; del Gobbo, E.; Corbo, M.; Aquino, A.","At first glance, for those who start out in it the academic environment may seem attractive, but they soon experience the difficulties inherent in this type of career. At the same time, the academic sector is crucial to the social, cultural, and economic development of any country. Given this important role, it is fundamental for the decision makers to guarantee the best return on investment made into this sector. The good health of workers has important implications for the quality of their lives since it affects their level of productivity at work, and it is especially relevant for research programmes, where most of the work is intellectual. In the present research, we have analysed the health of workers without tenure in the Italian academic environment, i.e. PhD students and short term contract researchers, in order to understand which factors have the most relevant impact on their state of health. 699 participants (398 females, 301 males) completed an online questionnaire that included both ad hoc Likert-scales and open-ended questions. Our results, elaborated through Structural Equation Modelling and Text Mining techniques, show how researchers experience high levels of anxiety both from the characteristics of the academic environment and from the career advancement system. Specifically, both job-related factors (i.e. perception of fairness, professional growth, and safety perception) and relational factors (i.e. relationships with supervisors and colleagues) predict the anxiety of non-tenured researchers.

MentaLLaMA: Interpretable Mental Health Analysis on Social Media with Large Language Models,"Yang, K.; Zhang, T.; Kuang, Z.; Xie, Q.; Huang, J.; Ananiadou, S.","As an integral part of people's daily lives, social media is becoming a rich source for automatic mental health analysis. As traditional discriminative methods bear poor generalization ability and low interpretability, the recent large language models (LLMs) have been explored for interpretable mental health analysis on social media, which aims to provide detailed explanations along with predictions in zero-shot or few-shot settings. The results show that LLMs still achieve unsatisfactory classification performance in a zero-shot/few-shot manner, which further significantly affects the quality of the generated explanations. Domain-specific finetuning is an effective solution, but faces two critical challenges: 1) lack of high-quality training data. 2) no open-source foundation LLMs. To alleviate these problems, we formally model interpretable mental health analysis as a text generation task, and build the first multi-task and multi-source interpretable mental health instruction (IMHI) dataset with 105K data samples to support LLM instruction tuning and evaluation. The raw social media data are collected from 10 existing sources covering 8 mental health analysis tasks. We prompt ChatGPT with expert-designed few-shot prompts to obtain explanations. To ensure the reliability of the explanations, we perform strict automatic and human evaluations on the correctness, consistency, and quality of generated data. Based on the IMHI dataset and LLaMA2 foundation models, we train MentaLLaMA, the first open-source instruction-following LLM series for interpretable mental health analysis on social media. We evaluate MentaLLaMA and other advanced methods on the IMHI benchmark, the first holistic evaluation benchmark for interpretable mental health analysis. The results show that MentaLLaMA approaches state-of-the-art discriminative methods in correctness and generates human-level explanations.

One of these social networks is Twitter, that can be considered as a microblogging social networking that allows users to communicate via tweets up to 140 characters. Relevant hashtags, Uniform Resource Locators (URL)s, images, emojis, animated gifs, and videos can all be included in the tweets. By analyzing Covid19 hashtags on Twitter, it is possible to detect the public’s feelings and opinions about this crisis. Understanding the thoughts concealed behind a word or a phrase can help better comprehend the feelings shared on social media. and can be accomplished through Sentiment Analysis (SA). This study aims to investigate the usefulness of hashtag Covid19 tweets in identifying the emotional polarity of the COVID-19 pandemic on Twitter via a SA process. This research’s methodology produced a revolutionary Ensemble classifier, in which a boosting approach called Random Forest (RF) is combined with Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) in the same model called Ens-RF-BERT. The sentiment ratings are classified as good, negative, or neutral using an ensemble voting model based on (RF) and the (BERT).

Distributions of recorded pain in mental health records: a natural language processing based study,"Chaturvedi, J.; Stewart, R.; Ashworth, M.; Roberts, A.","Objective The objective of this study is to determine demographic and diagnostic distributions of physical pain recorded in clinical notes of a mental health electronic health records database by using natural language processing and examine the overlap in recorded physical pain between primary and secondary care. Design, setting and participants The data were extracted from an anonymised version of the electronic health records of a large secondary mental healthcare provider serving a catchment of 1.3 million residents in south London. These included patients under active referral, aged 18+ at the index date of 1 July 2018 and having at least one clinical document (≥30 characters) between 1 July 2017 and 1 July 2019. This cohort was compared with linked primary care records from one of the four local government areas. Outcome The primary outcome of interest was the presence of recorded physical pain within the clinical notes of the patients, not including psychological or metaphorical pain. Results A total of 27 211 patients were retrieved. Of these, 52% (14,202) had narrative text containing relevant mentions of physical pain. Older patients (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.19), females (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.35 to 1.49), Asians (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.45) or black (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.40 to 1.59) ethnicities, living in deprived neighbourhoods (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.55 to 1.73) showed higher odds of recorded pain. Patients with severe mental illnesses were found to be less likely to report pain (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.46, p<0.001). 17% of the cohort from secondary care also had records from primary care. Conclusion The findings of this study show sociodemographic and diagnostic differences in recorded pain.

Calibration of Transformer-Based Models for Identifying Stress and Depression in Social Media,"Ilias, L.; Mouzakitis, S.; Askounis, D.","In today's fast-paced world, the rates of stress and depression present a surge. People use social media for expressing their thoughts and feelings through posts. Therefore, social media provide assistance for the early detection of mental health conditions. Existing methods mainly introduce feature extraction approaches and train shallow machine learning (ML) classifiers. For addressing the need of creating a large feature set and obtaining better performance, other research studies use deep neural networks or language models based on transformers. Despite the fact that transformer-based models achieve noticeable improvements, they cannot often capture rich factual knowledge. Although there have been proposed a number of studies aiming to enhance the pretrained transformer-based models with extra information or additional modalities, no prior work has exploited these modifications for detecting stress and depression through social media. In addition, although the reliability of a machine learning (ML) model's confidence in its predictions is critical for high-risk applications, there is no prior work taken into consideration the model calibration. To resolve the above issues, we present the first study in the task of depression and stress detection in social media, which injects extra-linguistic information in transformer-based models, namely, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) and MentalBERT. Specifically, the proposed approach employs a multimodal adaptation gate for creating the combined embeddings, which are given as input to a BERT (or MentalBERT) model. For taking into account the model calibration, we apply label smoothing. We test our proposed approaches in three publicly available datasets and demonstrate that the integration of linguistic features into transformer-based models presents a surge in performance. Also, the usage of label smoothing contributes to both the improvement of the model's performance and the calibration of the model. We finally perform a linguistic analysis of the posts and show differences in language between stressful and nonstressful texts, as well as depressive and nondepressive posts. © 2014 IEEE.",2024,,IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems,11,2,1979-1990,,10.1109/TCSS.2023.3283009,,#64,Ilias 2024,"",""
Analysis of addiction craving onset through natural language processing of the online forum Reddit,"Kramer, T.; Groh, G.; Stüben, N.; Soyka, M.","Aims Alcohol cravings are considered a major factor in relapse among individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD). This study aims to investigate the frequency and triggers of cravings in the daily lives of people with alcohol-related issues. Large amounts of data are analyzed with Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to identify possible groupings and patterns. Methods For the analysis, posts from the online forum “stopdrinking” on the Reddit platform were used as the dataset from April 2017 to April 2022. The posts were filtered for craving content and processed using the word2vec method to map them into a multi-dimensional vector space. Statistical analyses were conducted to calculate the nature and frequency of craving contexts and triggers (location, time, social environment, and emotions) using word similarity scores. Additionally, the themes of the craving-related posts were semantically grouped using a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model. The accuracy of the results was evaluated using two manually created test datasets. Results Approximately 16% of the forum posts discuss cravings. The number of craving-related posts decreases exponentially with the number of days since the author's last alcoholic drink. The topic model confirms that the majority of posts involve individual factors and triggers of cravings. The context analysis aligns with previous craving trigger findings related to the social environment, locations and emotions. Strong semantic craving similarities were found for the emotions boredom, stress and the location airport. The results for each method were successfully validated on test datasets. Conclusions This exploratory approach is the first to analyze alcohol cravings in the daily lives of over 24,000 individuals, providing a foundation for further AI-based craving analyses.

Augmenting sentiment prediction capabilities for code-mixed tweets with multilingual transformers,"Hashmi, E.; Yayilgan, S.Y.; Shaikh, S.","People in the modern digital era are increasingly embracing social media platforms to express their concerns and emotions in the form of reviews or comments. While positive interactions within diverse communities can considerably enhance confidence, it is critical to recognize that negative comments can hurt people’s reputations and well-being. Currently, individuals tend to express their thoughts in their native languages on these platforms, which is quite challenging due to potential syntactic ambiguity in these languages. Most of the research has been conducted for resource-aware languages like English. However, low-resource languages such as Urdu, Arabic, and Hindi present challenges due to limited linguistic resources, making information extraction labor-intensive. This study concentrates on code-mixed languages, including three types of text: English, Roman Urdu, and their combination. This study introduces robust transformer-based algorithms to enhance sentiment prediction in code-mixed text, which is a combination of Roman Urdu and English in the same context. Unlike conventional deep learning-based models, transformers are adept at handling syntactic ambiguity, facilitating the interpretation of semantics across various languages. We used state-of-the-art transformer-based models like Electra, code-mixed BERT (cm-BERT), and Multilingual Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers (mBART) to address sentiment prediction challenges in code-mixed tweets. Furthermore, results reveal that mBART outperformed the Electra and cm-BERT models for sentiment prediction in code-mixed text with an overall F1-score of 0.73.

Text mining domestic violence police narratives to identify behaviours linked to coercive control,"Karystianis, G.; Chowdhury, N.; Sheridan, L.; Reutens, S.; Wade, S.; Allnutt, S.; Kim, M.-T.; Poynton, S.; Butler, T.","Background and setting: Domestic and family violence (DFV) is a significant societal problem that predominantly affects women and children. One behaviour that has been linked to DFV perpetration is coercive control. While various definitions have been proposed, it involves “acts of assault, threats, humiliation and intimidation or other abuse that is used to harm, punish, or frighten a victim” ranging from emotional to social and financial abuse. One potentially rich source of information on coercive control are police reports. In this paper we determine whether it is possible to automatically identify behaviours linked to coercive control from DFV police reports and present the prevalence of such behaviours by age and sex. Methods: We modified an existing rule-based text mining method to identify 48 coercive control related behaviours from 406,196 DFV reports involving a single person of interest (POI) (i.e., an individual suspected or charged with a DFV offence) against a single victim from NSW Police Force records between 2009 and 2020. Results: 223,778 (54.6%) DFV events had at least one identifiable coercive control behaviour with the most common behaviour being verbal abuse (38.9%) followed by property damage (30.0%). Financial (3.2%) and social abuse (0.4%) were the least common behaviours linked to coercive control. No major differences were found in the proportion of DFV events between male and female POIs or victims. The oldest POI group (≥ 65 years) had the largest proportion for behaviours related to verbal abuse (38.0%) while the youngest POI group reported the highest proportion of DFV involving property damage (45.5%). The youngest victim group (< 18 years old) had the highest proportion of DFV events involving verbal abuse (37.3%) while victims between 18 and 24 years old reported the most harassment through phone calls and text messages (3.1% and 2.4% respectively); double that of those in the oldest (≥ 65 years) victim group (1.4% and 0.7% respectively). Conclusions: Police data capture a wide variety of behaviours linked to coercive control, offering insights across the age spectrum and sex. Text mining can be used to retrieve such information. However, social and financial abuse were not commonly recorded emphasising the need to improve police training to encourage inquiring about such behaviours when attending DFV events. © The Author(s) 2024.",2024,,Crime Science,13,1,,,10.1186/s40163-024-00200-2,,#83,Karystianis 2024,"",""
Decoding violence against women: analysing harassment in middle eastern literature with machine learning and sentiment analysis,"Low, H.Q.; Keikhosrokiani, P.; Pourya Asl, M.","The rising prevalence of harassment in Middle Eastern countries is mirrored in literary works from the region. However, extracting data from these texts to understand the typology and frequency of the cases poses a significant challenge due to human cognitive limitations and potential biases. Thus, this study aims to use natural language processing (NLP) approaches to propose a machine learning framework for text mining of sexual harassment content in literary texts. The data source for this study consists of twelve Middle Eastern novels. The proposed framework involves the classification of physical and non-physical types of sexual harassment using a machine-learning model. Lexicon-based sentiment and emotion detection are applied to sentences containing instances of sexual harassment for data labelling and analysis. Finally, a long short-term memory-gated recurrent unit (LSTM-GRU) deep learning model is built to classify the sentiment characteristics that induce sexual harassment. The proposed model achieved an accuracy of 75.8% while outperforming five other algorithms. Additionally, a sentiment classification with three labels—negative, positive, and neutral—was developed using an LSTM-GRU RNN deep learning model. The accuracy of this model was 84.5%. Most statements, even those involving physical sexual harassment, which had greater levels of sexual harassment, had negative sentiments, according to lexicon-based sentiment analysis. This study contributes to the field of text mining by providing a novel approach to identifying instances of sexual harassment in literature in English from the Middle East. The use of machine learning models and sentiment analysis techniques allows for more accurate identification and classification of different types of sexual harassment.

Combining sentiment analysis and text mining with content analysis of farm vet interviews on mental wellbeing in livestock practice,"Duncan, A.J.; Henry, M.K.; Lamont, K.","Background The aim of the How Farm Vets Cope project was to co-design, with farm veterinary surgeons, a set of web-based resources to help them and others deal with the different situations that they can face. As part of the wider project, participants were recruited for one-toone semi-structured phone interviews. These interviews focused on elements of job satisfaction and how the participants coped during periods of poor mental wellbeing or with setbacks and failure. Methods Transcripts of these interviews were analysed using both quantitative methods of sentiment analysis and text mining, including term frequency/inverse document frequency and rapid automated keyword extraction, and qualitative content analysis. The twin aims of the analysis were identifying the important themes discussed by the participants and comparing the results of the two methods to see what differences, if any, arose. Results Analysis using the afinn and nrc sentiment lexicons identified emotional themes of anticipation and trust. Rapid automated keyword extraction highlighted issues around age of vets and support, whilst using term frequency/inverse document frequency allowed for individual themes, such as religion, not present across all responses, to be identified. Content analysis supported these findings, pinpointing examples of trust around relationships with farmers and more experienced vets, along with some examples of the difference good support networks can make, particularly to younger vets. Findings This work has confirmed previous results in identifying the themes of trust, communication and support to be integral to the experience of practicing farm veterinary surgeons. Younger or less experienced vets recognised themselves as benefiting from further support and signposting, leading to a discussion around the preparation of veterinary students for entry into a farm animal vet practice. The two different approaches taken showed very good agreement in their results. The quantitative approaches can be scaled to allow a larger number of interviews to be utilised in studies whilst still allowing the important qualitative results to be identified.  © 2024 Duncan et al.

Furthermore, clinical and biomedical large language models (LLMs) were explored for predicting life satisfaction by converting tabular data into natural language sentences through mapping and adding meaningful counterparts, achieving an accuracy of 93.74% and macro F1-score of 73.21%. It was found that life satisfaction prediction is more closely related to the biomedical domain than the clinical domain. Ablation studies were also conducted to understand the impact of data resampling and feature selection techniques on model performance. Moreover, the correlation between primary determinants with different age brackets was analyzed, and it was found that health condition is the most important determinant across all ages. The best performing Machine Learning model trained in this study is deployed on a public server, ensuring unrestricted usage of the model. We highlight the advantages of machine learning methods for predicting life satisfaction and the significance of XAI for interpreting and validating these predictions. This study demonstrates how machine learning, large language models and XAI can jointly contribute to building trust and understanding in using AI to investigate human behavior, with significant ramifications for academics and professionals working to quantify and comprehend subjective well-being. © 2024 The Author(s)",2024,,Heliyon,10,10,,,10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e31158,,#97,Khan 2024,"",""
Measuring quality-of-care in treatment of young children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder using pre-trained language models,"Pillai, M.; Posada, J.; Gardner, R.M.; Hernandez-Boussard, T.; Bannett, Y.","Objective: To measure pediatrician adherence to evidence-based guidelines in the treatment of young children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in a diverse healthcare system using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Materials and Methods: We extracted structured and free-text data from electronic health records (EHRs) of all office visits (2015-2019) of children aged 4-6 years in a community-based primary healthcare network in California, who had ≥1 visits with an ICD-10 diagnosis of ADHD. Two pediatricians annotated clinical notes of the first ADHD visit for 423 patients. Inter-annotator agreement (IAA) was assessed for the recommendation for the first-line behavioral treatment (F-measure = 0.89). Four pre-trained language models, including BioClinical Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BioClinicalBERT), were used to identify behavioral treatment recommendations using a 70/30 train/test split. For temporal validation, we deployed BioClinicalBERT on 1,020 unannotated notes from other ADHD visits and well-care visits; all positively classified notes (n = 53) and 5% of negatively classified notes (n = 50) were manually reviewed. Results: Of 423 patients, 313 (74%) were male; 298 (70%) were privately insured; 138 (33%) were White; 61 (14%) were Hispanic. The BioClinicalBERT model trained on the first ADHD visits achieved F1 = 0.76, precision = 0.81, recall = 0.72, and AUC = 0.81 [0.72-0.89]. Temporal validation achieved F1 = 0.77, precision = 0.68, and recall = 0.88. Fairness analysis revealed low model performance in publicly insured patients (F1 = 0.53). Conclusion: Deploying pre-trained language models on a variable set of clinical notes accurately captured pediatrician adherence to guidelines in the treatment of children with ADHD. Validating this approach in other patient populations is needed to achieve equitable measurement of quality of care at scale and improve clinical care for mental health conditions.  © 2024 The Author(s).

Enhancing cyberbullying detection: a comparative study of ensemble CNN–SVM and BERT models,"Saini, H.; Mehra, H.; Rani, R.; Jaiswal, G.; Sharma, A.; Dev, A.","Technological improvements have increased the number of people who use online social networking sites, resulting in an increase in cyberbullying. Bullies can attack victims through a large network of online social networking platforms. Cyberbullying is an umbrella term encompassing a wide range of online abuse, including but not limited to harassment, doxing, and reputation attacks. These attacks frequently leave the victim(s) with persistent mental scars, leading to desperate measures such as depression, self-harm, and suicidal thoughts. Given the effects of cyberbullying, there is an urgent need to prosecute and prevent such crimes. This paper gives a comprehensive review as well the empirical analysis of the machine learning, ensemble based and transformer-based models for the cyberbullying detection. This paper proposes two architectures to efficiently detect cyberbullying pattern. The proposed ensemble model makes use of CNN to extract the relevant features and the classification is performed by the SVM. Another proposed architecture utilizes the pre-trained model BERT to detect cyberbullying behavior on online platforms. Both the proposed models were tested on two separate datasets and achieved maximum accuracy of 96.88 and 97.34% for ensemble and BERT models, respectively. This paper provides a thorough examination of the various methodologies used for cyberbullying detection and conducts an empirical and comparative analysis of the presented models with traditional and current algorithms. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",2024,,Social Network Analysis and Mining,14,1,,,10.1007/s13278-023-01158-w,,#100,Saini 2024,"",""
Evaluating the Social Media Users’ Mental Health Status During COVID-19 Pandemic Using Deep Learning,"Fernández-Barrera, I.; Bravo-Bustos, S.; Vidal, M.","Depression is a globally known disease with a great impact on the suicide rate. However, this can be an early diagnostic by observing the behavior of the patients through the time. In this research, we studied the linguistics and visual features of depressive mood during COVID-19 pre and post-pandemic based on Flickr posts. We implemented the significant advances in text-based sentiment analysis and image classification using Natural Language Processing (NLP), histograms and deep learning strategies to characterize some of the main patterns of depression. We demonstrate that user’s behavior in social media had a relevant impact during pandemics, since the main patterns change drastically between periods. For images, we found that in pre-pandemic, user posts were more uniform in color distribution and with medium to low levels of light intensity. Besides, the scenes were more outside activities like. For text, we found that the topics and general sentiment were always depressive and with negative connotation, however, during pre-pandemic they described attributes of the symptomatology of depression pathology, while in post-pandemic are more related to the product of isolation and fear. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",2024,,IFMBE Proceedings,108,,60-68,,10.1007/978-3-031-59216-4_7,,#106,Fernández-Barrera 2024,"",""
Can ChatGPT provide a better support: a comparative analysis of ChatGPT and dataset responses in mental health dialogues,"Naher, J.","This study conducted an in-depth analysis of responses generated by ChatGPT, a popular language model-based chat application, in the context of mental health conversations. The analysis encompassed three key dimensions: word count, sentiment analysis, and response quality. ChatGPT consistently outperformed the dataset, delivering longer responses with an average word count of 352, compared to the dataset’s 70. This raises questions about the depth of information conveyed. ChatGPT responses demonstrated an average sentiment score of 0.53, surpassing the dataset’s average of 0.23. This heightened sentiment in ChatGPT responses, coupled with their more extensive word count, suggests a potential for enhanced emotional engagement and nuanced communication, particularly crucial in mental health support scenarios. Finally, ChatGPT responses exhibited a more substantial incorporation of relevant information, showcased a higher degree of empathy toward user queries, and elevated sentiment scores, positioning it as a potentially effective mental health assistant. These findings offer valuable insights into the potential role of ChatGPT as a mental health assistant. However, it is imperative to emphasize the need for further research employing larger and more diverse datasets to comprehensively assess its practical applicability.

Landscape Analysis of Neurodevelopmental Comorbidities in Newborn Screening Conditions: Challenges and Opportunities,"Talebizadeh, Z.; Hu, V.; Shababi, M.; Brower, A.","Newborn screening (NBS) is a large-scale public health program in the US that screens 3.8 million newborns for up to 81 genetic conditions each year. Many of these conditions have comorbidities, including neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). These comorbidities can have a significant impact on health outcomes across the lifespan. Most screened conditions are inborn errors of metabolism. PKU, the first condition identified by NBS, is an inherited metabolic disorder that can cause developmental delays and intellectual/developmental disabilities if not treated. The Newborn Screening Translational Research Network (NBSTRN) is a program that has been funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development since 2008. NBSTRN is charged with developing, maintaining, and enhancing tools, resources, and expertise supporting NBS research. One of the tasks led by NBSTRN is to provide direction for developing question/answer sets used in the Longitudinal Pediatric Data Resource (LPDR) to create consensus-based and standardized common data elements (CDEs) for NBS conditions. There is growing interest in the NBS community in assessing neurodevelopmental trajectories through long-term follow-up studies. This could be streamlined by employing uniform CDEs. To address this unmet need, we conducted a landscape analysis to (1) explore the co-occurrence of NDD-related comorbidities and NBS conditions using text mining in MedGen, (2) compile a list of NDD-related CDEs from existing repositories as well as LPDR data dictionaries, and (3) identify challenges and knowledge gaps hindering the early identification of risks for NDDs in NBS conditions. Our findings can inform future efforts toward advancing the research infrastructure for this established public health program. The renewed awareness of the risk of NDDs after a positive NBS and diagnosis could lead to improved treatment guidelines for mental health conditions. © 2024 by the authors.",2024,,International Journal of Neonatal Screening,10,1,,,10.3390/ijns10010004,,#109,Talebizadeh 2024,"",""
Hybrid evolutionary intelligent network for sentiment analysis using Twitter data during COVID-19 pandemic,"Kour, H.; Gupta, M.K.","COVID-19 pandemic has impacted many nations, causing physical as well as mental health concerns globally. In most countries, governments enforced strict lockdowns and social distancing, thus affecting people's daily lives. People usually tweet their views on online platforms that is unstructured text with implicit meaning. With the evolution of artificial intelligence in the natural language processing domain, the prediction of sentiments accurately has become a challenge. To contribute as a solution to this, a hybrid approach is proposed for sentiment prediction with the use of an evolutionary-based approach, transfer-based learning and machine learning. The proposed approach uses bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) with genetic algorithm (GA) and support vector machine (SVM), namely, hybrid evolutionary intelligent model (GA-BERT-SVM). These approaches aid in extracting important features considering semantics and context present in the text. To avoid the limitations of the backpropagation approach, such as trapping in local minima and overfitting the data, the initial parameters (weights and biases) of the dense layers has been optimized using GA. Additionally, the pretrained BERT layers are utilized without any modification, following a standard transfer learning approach. The BERT embeddings are concatenated with the SVM for training and classification. GridSearchCV and GeneticSearchCV is used for obtaining optimal parameters of SVM. A multi-classification problem is tackled using a benchmark COVID-19 dataset, which comprises of Twitter data and is categorized into COVIDSENTI-A, COVIDSENTI-B, COVIDSENTI-C and a combined dataset called COVIDSENTI.

Impacts of workplace verbal aggression classified via text mining on workers' mental health,"Nishimura, Y.; Matsumoto, S.; Sasaki, T.; Kubo, T.","Background: Exposure to workplace aggression adversely affects workers' health; however, little is known regarding the impact of specific types of verbal content. Aims: We aimed to examine the relationship between exposure to several types of aggressive words at work and the victim's depressive symptoms and sleep disturbance using text mining. Methods: We conducted a longitudinal survey with 800 workers in wholesale and retail companies; of which, 500 responded to the follow-up survey. The Centre for Epidemiologic Studies - Depression Scale and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were filled out by the participants, and their responses were analysed by logistic regression to evaluate the risk of depression or sleep problems. We collected exact aggressive words encountered at work over the past year as a dependent variable and classified it into four types using text mining, such as words criticizing one's performance. Results: The follow-up rate was 63%. Exposure to words threatening one's life showed a significant relationship with the risk of depression (odds ratio [OR] = 13.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.76-110.56). The exposure to words criticizing one's job performance is significantly related to the risk of sleep disturbance (OR = 5.56, 95% CI = 2.08-14.88). Conclusions: These findings suggest that different contents of verbal aggression can have different impacts on workers' health. This indicates that not only overtly threatening and abusive language but also words related to one's performance can be a risk factor for workers, depending on how they are delivered. To mitigate the adverse effects, promoting effective communication and cultivating psychological detachment from work may be beneficial. © 2024 The Author(s).

An Intra- and Inter-Emotion Transformer-Based Fusion Model with Homogeneous and Diverse Constraints Using Multi-Emotional Audiovisual Features for Depression Detection,"Teng, S.; Liu, J.; Huang, Y.; Chai, S.; Tateyama, T.; Huang, X.; Lin, L.; Chen, Y.-W.","Depression is a prevalent mental disorder affecting a significant portion of the global population, leading to considerable disability and contributing to the overall burden of disease. Consequently, designing efficient and robust automated methods for depression detection has become imperative. Recently, deep learning methods, especially multimodal fusion methods, have been increasingly used in computer-aided depression detection. Importantly, individuals with depression and those without respond differently to various emotional stimuli, providing valuable information for detecting depression. Building on these observations, we propose an intra- and inter-emotional stimulus transformer-based fusion model to effectively extract depression-related features. The intra-emotional stimulus fusion framework aims to prioritize different modalities, capitalizing on their diversity and complementarity for depression detection. The inter-emotional stimulus model maps each emotional stimulus onto both invariant and specific subspaces using individual invariant and specific encoders. The emotional stimulus-invariant subspace facilitates efficient information sharing and integration across different emotional stimulus categories, while the emotional stimulus specific subspace seeks to enhance diversity and capture the distinct characteristics of individual emotional stimulus categories. Our proposed intra- and inter-emotional stimulus fusion model effectively integrates multimodal data under various emotional stimulus categories, providing a comprehensive representation that allows accurate task predictions in the context of depression detection. We evaluate the proposed model on the Chinese Soochow University students dataset, and the results outperform state-of-the-art models in terms of concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), root mean squared error (RMSE) and accuracy.

Strategy for developing a speech recognition model specialized for patients with depression or Parkinson’s disease with small size speech database,"Yoon, S.; Maeng, S.; Kim, R.; Lee, S.","Most of speech recognition models currently in use have been dealt with speech of normal people. The speech recognition rate for patients with depression or Parkinson’s disease (PD) who show differences in speech characteristics compared to normal subjects is lower than that of normal subjects. This study explores the model to enhance accuracy of speech recognition for individuals who have depression or PD, aiming to provide them more accurate service. In this study, considering the speech features of patients with depression or PD, we designed a model with the assumption that understanding the overall meaning and context of speech through the utilization of global information, rather than local information, is more effective in enhancing recognition accuracy. We propose the m-Globalformer, a model based on the Globalformer architecture that combines the squeeze-and-excitation (SE) module with the Transformer. The m-Globalformer enhances the utilization of global information by modifying the base SE module. The model employs pre-training and fine-tuning strategies, considering the limited speech data of the patients.

Emotion Flip Reasoning in Multiparty Conversations,"Kumar, S.; Dudeja, S.; Akhtar, M.S.; Chakraborty, T.","In a conversational dialogue, speakers may have different emotional states and their dynamics play an important role in understanding dialogue's emotional discourse. However, simply detecting emotions is not sufficient to entirely comprehend the speaker-specific changes in emotion that occur during a conversation. To understand the emotional dynamics of speakers in an efficient manner, it is imperative to identify the rationale or instigator behind any changes or flips in emotion expressed by the speaker. In this article, we explore the task called instigator-based emotion flip reasoning (EFR), which aims to identify the instigator behind a speaker's emotion flipwithin a conversation. For example, an emotion flip from joy to anger could be caused by an instigator like threat. To facilitate this task, we present MELD-I, a dataset that includes ground-truth EFR instigator labels, which are in line with emotional psychology. To evaluate the dataset, we propose a novel neural architecture called TGIF, which leverages Transformer encoders and stackedGRUs to capture the dialogue context, speaker dynamics, and emotion sequence in a conversation. Our evaluation demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance (+4%- 12% increase in F1-score) against five baselines used for the task. Further, we establish the generalizability of TGIF on an unseen dataset in a zero-shot setting. In addition, we provide a detailed analysis of the competing models, highlighting the advantages and limitations of our neural architecture. Impact Statement-Emotions play a pivotal role in deciding the impact of a statement uttered. However, in a conversational setting, simply identifying emotions of utterances in a dialogue is not enough to characterize the emotional dynamic of the speaker. To this end, the proposed task of EFR is eminent. The proposed flip explanations via triggers and instigators can help scrutinize how a particular type of remark or expression affects the end listener. A response generation mechanism can use these triggers or instigators as feedback to steer a conversation so that the user feels chipper.  © 2022 IEEE.",2024,,IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence,5,3,1339-1348,,10.1109/TAI.2023.3289937,,#138,Kumar 2024,"",""

Utilizing patient-nurse verbal communication in building risk identification models: The missing critical data stream in home healthcare,"Zolnoori, M.; Sridharan, S.; Zolnour, A.; Vergez, S.; McDonald, M.V.; Kostic, Z.; Bowles, K.H.; Topaz, M.","Background: In the United States, over 12 000 home healthcare agencies annually serve 6+ million patients, mostly aged 65+ years with chronic conditions. One in three of these patients end up visiting emergency department (ED) or being hospitalized. Existing risk identification models based on electronic health record (EHR) data have suboptimal performance in detecting these high-risk patients. Objectives: To measure the added value of integrating audio-recorded home healthcare patient-nurse verbal communication into a risk identification model built on home healthcare EHR data and clinical notes. Methods: This pilot study was conducted at one of the largest not-for-profit home healthcare agencies in the United States. We audio-recorded 126 patient-nurse encounters for 47 patients, out of which 8 patients experienced ED visits and hospitalization. The risk model was developed and tested iteratively using: (1) structured data from the Outcome and Assessment Information Set, (2) clinical notes, and (3) verbal communication features. We used various natural language processing methods to model the communication between patients and nurses. Results: Using a Support Vector Machine classifier, trained on the most informative features from OASIS, clinical notes, and verbal communication, we achieved an AUC-ROC = 99.68 and an F1-score = 94.12. By integrating verbal communication into the risk models, the F-1 score improved by 26%. The analysis revealed patients at high risk tended to interact more with risk-associated cues, exhibit more ""sadness""and ""anxiety,""and have extended periods of silence during conversation.

This study embarked on an innovative and rigorous strategy to unearth potential drug repurposing candidates for opioid and cocaine addiction treatment, bridging the gap between transcriptomic data analysis and drug discovery. We initiated our approach by conducting differential gene expression analysis on addiction-related transcriptomic data to identify key genes. We propose a novel topological differentiation to identify key genes from a protein–protein interaction network derived from DEGs. This method utilizes persistent Laplacians to accurately single out pivotal nodes within the network, conducting this analysis in a multiscale manner to ensure high reliability. Through rigorous literature validation, pathway analysis and data-availability scrutiny, we identified three pivotal molecular targets, mTOR, mGluR5 and NMDAR, for drug repurposing from DrugBank. We crafted machine learning models employing two natural language processing (NLP)-based embeddings and a traditional 2D fingerprint, which demonstrated robust predictive ability in gauging binding affinities of DrugBank compounds to selected targets. Furthermore, we elucidated the interactions of promising drugs with the targets and evaluated their drug-likeness.

Mental illness may not alone explain whether suicidal thoughts or behaviors will occur; it remains uncertain how poverty affects suicidality among Hispanic persons with known mental health conditions. Our objective was to examine whether poverty was associated with suicidal ideation among Hispanic mental healthcare patients from 2016 to 2019. Methods: We used de-identified electronic health record (EHR) data from Holmusk, captured using the MindLinc EHR system. Our analytic sample included 4,718 Hispanic patient-year observations from 13 states. Holmusk uses deep-learning natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to quantify free-text patient assessment data and poverty for mental health patients. We conducted a pooled cross-sectional analysis and estimated logistic regression models. Results: Hispanic mental health patients who experienced poverty had 1.55 greater odds of having suicidal thoughts in a given year than patients who did not experience poverty. Conclusion: Poverty may put Hispanic patients at greater risk for suicidal thoughts even when they are already receiving treatment for psychiatric conditions. NLP appears to be a promising approach for categorizing free-text information on social circumstances affecting suicidality in clinical settings. © The Author(s) 2023.",2024,,Hispanic Health Care International,22,1,6-10,,10.1177/15404153231181110,,#157,Goldstein 2024,"",""
Fine grain emotion analysis in Spanish using linguistic features and transformers,"Salmerón-Ríos, A.; García-Díaz, J.A.; Pan, R.; Valencia-García, R.","Mental health issues are a global concern, with a particular focus on the rise of depression. Depression affects millions of people worldwide and is a leading cause of suicide, particularly among young people. Recent surveys indicate an increase in cases of depression during the COVID-19 pandemic, which affected approximately 5.4% of the population in Spain in 2020. Social media platforms such as X (formerly Twitter) have become important hubs for health information as more people turn to these platforms to share their struggles and seek emotional support. Researchers have discovered a link between emotions and mental illnesses such as depression. This correlation provides a valuable opportunity for automated analysis of social media data to detect changes in mental health status that might otherwise go unnoticed, thus preventing more serious health consequences. Therefore, this research explores the field of emotion analysis in Spanish towards mental disorders. There are two contributions in this area. On the one hand, the compilation, translation, evaluation and correction of a novel dataset composed of a mixture of other existing datasets in the bibliography. This dataset compares a total of 16 emotions, with an emphasis on negative emotions. On the other hand, the in-depth evaluation of this novel dataset with several state-of-the-art transformers based on encoder-only and encoder-decoder architectures. The analysis compromises monolingual, multilingual and distilled models as well as feature integration techniques. The best results are obtained with the encoder-only MarIA model, with a macro-average F1 score of 60.4771%. © Copyright 2024 Salmerón-Ríos et al.",2024,,PeerJ Computer Science,10,,,,10.7717/PEERJ-CS.1992,,#158,Salmerón-Ríos 2024,"",""
Chinese Cyberbullying Detection Using XLNet and Deep Bi-LSTM Hybrid Model,"Chen, S.; Wang, J.; He, K.","The popularization of the internet and the widespread use of smartphones have led to a rapid growth in the number of social media users. While information technology has brought convenience to people, it has also given rise to cyberbullying, which has a serious negative impact. The identity of online users is hidden, and due to the lack of supervision and the imperfections of relevant laws and policies, cyberbullying occurs from time to time, bringing serious mental harm and psychological trauma to the victims. The pre-trained language model BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) has achieved good results in the field of natural language processing, which can be used for cyberbullying detection. In this research, we construct a variety of traditional machine learning, deep learning and Chinese pre-trained language models as a baseline, and propose a hybrid model based on a variant of BERT: XLNet, and deep Bi-LSTM for Chinese cyberbullying detection. In addition, real cyber bullying remarks are collected to expand the Chinese offensive language dataset COLDATASET. The performance of the proposed model outperforms all baseline models on this dataset, improving 4.29% compared to SVM—the best performing method in traditional machine learning, 1.49% compared to GRU—the best performing method in deep learning, and 1.13% compared to BERT. © 2024 by the authors.",2024,,Information (Switzerland),15,2,,,10.3390/info15020093,,#160,Chen 2024,"",""
Characteristics of domestic violence perpetrators with dementia from police records using text mining,"Reutens, S.; Karystianis, G.; Withall, A.; Butler, T.","Aim: Few studies have examined the characteristics of domestic violence (DV) committed by people with dementia. We provide an overview of DV perpetrated by people with dementia in the community based on police reports of attendances at DV events. Method: A text mining method was used on 416,441 New South Wales (NSW) police narratives of DV events from January 2005 to December 2016 to extract information for Persons of Interest (POIs) with mentions of dementia. Results: Events involving those with dementia accounted for a relatively low proportion of total DV events (<1%). Of the 260 DV events with a dementia mention for the POI, the most common abuse types were assault (49.7%) and verbal abuse (31.6%). Spouses were the largest group of victims (50.8%) followed by children (8.8%). Physical abuse was common, occurring in 82.4% of events, but injuries were relatively mild. Although weapons were infrequently used, they were involved in 5% of events, mostly by POIs aged 75 years and older. Similarly, the POIs were mainly aged 75+ years (60%), however the proportion of those aged <65 was relatively high (20.8%) compared to the reported prevalence of dementia in that age group. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that some cases of DV perpetrated by people with reported dementia are significant enough to warrant police involvement. This highlights the need to proactively discuss the potential for violence as part of the holistic management and support family members, particularly those caring for people with young-onset dementias.

Using Natural Language Processing to Predict Risk in Electronic Health Records,"Van Le, D.; Montgomery, J.; Kirkby, K.; Scanlan, J.","Clinical narratives recording behaviours and emotions of patients are available from EHRs in a forensic psychiatric centre located in Tasmania. This rich data has not been used in risk prediction. Prior work demonstrates natural language processing can be used to identify patient symptoms in these free-text records and can then be used to predict risk. Four dictionaries containing descriptive words of harm were created using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the Unified Medical Language System repository, English negative and positive sentiment words, and high-frequency words from the Corpus of Contemporary American English. However, a model based only on these keywords is limited in predictive power.

Young-Adult Multimodal Attachment Style Classification,"Maghfira, T.N.; Basaruddin, T.; Krisnadhi, A.A.; Pudjiati, S.R.R.","Attachment systems, representing emotional bonds with significant others, have emerged as an important aspect of psychology that influences self-development and social interactions. Adult attachment studies in psychology have mostly relied on questionnaires and interviews, primarily centered on romantic relationships and parent-child dynamics during childhood. In machine learning-based adult attachment studies, the assessment of objective aspects of non-verbal behaviors is also investigated, but how these behavioral characteristics are associated with attachment remains unexplored. This paper introduces a new multimodal model for attachment style classification, focusing on close relationships established within young adults. Our proposed model integrates representations of emotions derived from non-verbal behaviors alongside subjective responses to classify attachment styles. Leveraging pre-trained Swin Transformers for capturing emotion associations in facial expression videos and pre-trained ResNet50 for analyzing speech responses, we fuse the best emotion representations from both datasets with rating data from the Experiences in Close Relationships - Relationship Structures (ECR-RS) for attachment style classification. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model enhances the performance of unimodal behavioral data and subjective questionnaire responses by 1.13%.

Could artificial intelligence write mental health nursing care plans?,"Woodnutt, S.; Allen, C.; Snowden, J.; Flynn, M.; Hall, S.; Libberton, P.; Purvis, F.","What is Known on the Subject?: Artificial intelligence (AI) is freely available, responds to very basic text input (such as a question) and can now create a wide range of outputs, communicating in many languages or art forms. AI platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT can now create passages of text that could be used to create plans of care for people with mental health needs. As such, AI output can be difficult to distinguish from human-output, and there is a risk that its use could go unnoticed. What this Paper Adds to Existing Knowledge?: Whilst it is known that AI can produce text or pass pre-registration health-profession exams, it is not known if AI can produce meaningful results for care delivery. We asked ChatGPT basic questions about a fictitious person who presents with self-harm and then evaluated the quality of the output. We found that the output could look reasonable to laypersons but there were significant errors and ethical issues. There are potential harms to people in care if AI is used without an expert correcting or removing these errors. What are the Implications for Practice?: We suggest that there is a risk that AI use could cause harm if it was used in direct care delivery. There is a lack of policy and research to safeguard people receiving care - and this needs to be in place before AI should be used in this way. Key aspects of the role of a mental health nurse are relational and AI use may diminish mental health nurses' ability to provide safe care in its current form. Many aspects of mental health recovery are linked to relationships and social engagement, however AI is not able to provide this and may push the people who are in most need of help further away from services that assist recovery. Abstract: Background Artificial intelligence (AI) is being increasingly used and discussed in care contexts. ChatGPT has gained significant attention in popular and scientific literature although how ChatGPT can be used in care-delivery is not yet known. Aims To use artificial intelligence (ChatGPT) to create a mental health nursing care plan and evaluate the quality of the output against the authors’ clinical experience and existing guidance. Materials & Methods Basic text commands were input into ChatGPT about a fictitious person called ‘Emily’ who presents with self-injurious behaviour. The output from ChatGPT was then evaluated against the authors’ clinical experience and current (national) care guidance. Results ChatGPT was able to provide a care plan that incorporated some principles of dialectical behaviour therapy, but the output had significant errors and limitations and thus there is a reasonable likelihood of harm if used in this way. Discussion AI use is increasing in direct-care contexts through the use of chatbots or other means. However, AI can inhibit clinician to care-recipient engagement, ‘recycle’ existing stigma, and introduce error, which may thus diminish the ability for care to uphold personhood and therefore lead to significant avoidable harms. Conclusion Use of AI in this context should be avoided until a point where policy and guidance can safeguard the wellbeing of care recipients and the sophistication of AI output has increased. Given ChatGPT’s ability to provide superficially reasonable outputs there is a risk that errors may go unnoticed and thus increase the likelihood of patient harms. Further research evaluating AI output is needed to consider how AI may be used safely in care delivery. © 2023 The Authors.

"Multimodal emotion recognition based on the fusion of vision, EEG, ECG, and EMG signals","Bhatlawande, S.; Shilaskar, S.; Pramanik, S.; Sole, S.","– This paper presents a novel approach for emotion recognition (ER) based on Electroencephalogram (EEG), Electromyogram (EMG), Electrocardiogram (ECG), and computer vision. The proposed system includes two different models for physiological signals and facial expressions deployed in a real-time embedded system. A custom dataset for EEG, ECG, EMG, and facial expression was collected from 10 participants using an Affective Video Response System. Time, frequency, and wavelet domain-specific features were extracted and optimized, based on their Visualizations from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Local Ternary Patterns (LTP), Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), and Gabor descriptors were used for differentiating facial emotions. Classification models, namely decision tree, random forest, and optimized variants thereof, were trained using these features. The optimized Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of 84%, while the optimized Decision Tree achieved 76% for the physiological signal-based model. The facial emotion recognition (FER) model attained an accuracy of 84.6%, 74.3%, 67%, and 64.5% using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, Decision Tree, and XGBoost, respectively. Performance metrics, including Area Under Curve (AUC), F1 score, and Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC), were computed to evaluate the models. The outcome of both results, i.e., the fusion of bio-signals and facial emotion analysis, is given to a voting classifier to get the final emotion. A comprehensive report is generated using the Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) language model based on the resultant emotion, achieving an accuracy of 87.5%. The model was implemented and deployed on a Jetson Nano. The results show its relevance to ER. It has applications in enhancing prosthetic systems and other medical fields such as psychological therapy, rehabilitation, assisting individuals with neurological disorders, mental health monitoring, and biometric security. © 2024, J.J.

Emotion mining for early suicidal threat detection on both social media and suicide notes using context dynamic masking-based transformer with deep learning,"Kodati, D.; Tene, R.","Suicide represents a poignant societal issue deeply entwined with mental well-being. While existing research primarily focuses on identifying suicide-related texts, there is a gap in the advanced detection of mental health states leading to suicidal tendencies. The purpose is to recognize the emotions influencing individuals’ mental states, potentially leading to suicidal behavior. This study seeks to identify specific emotions like anger, depression, anxiety, guilt, fear, stress, and sadness within suicide-related texts sourced from both social media and suicide notes. We introduce a novel suicide severity assessment method emphasizing emotion detection across categories like suicidal ideation, suicide planning, attempted, committed, suicide notes, describing, and cannot dare. By identifying high-intensity negative emotions, our approach enables early detection of potential suicide threats. Existing studies often struggle to capture nuances and semantic relationships, particularly in suicide-related contexts. To address this, we propose a context dynamic masking based on bidirectional long short-term memory along with a multi-head self-attention and convolutional neural network (CoDyn-BMHSA-CNN) model, capturing bidirectional contexts and maintaining variable-length sequences. Our model achieves accuracies of 98.2% and 97.4%, with F1 scores of 95.5% and 93.8% for social media and suicide note datasets, respectively. We perform ablation tests to pinpoint the key components of our proposed models. Furthermore, a thorough comparative analysis evaluates the model’s performance across various contexts and platforms.

Depression detection based on social networking sites using data mining,"Pande, S.D.; Hasane Ahammad, S.K.; Gurav, M.N.; Faragallah, O.S.; Eid, M.M.A.; Rashed, A.N.Z.","Social networking is becoming increasingly prevalent in today's globe. Young folks, senior citizens, and the general public use social media. However, over usage of social network communication harms human existence. In recent years, many mental diseases, such as reliance on cybernetic interactions, information overload, and network restriction, have been noticed in social networks. Currently, the indications of those mental diseases can be seen, posing several dangers. Human emotions, such as despair, are interior feelings that reveal an individual's actual behavior. Monitoring and detecting these thoughts from individual's choices in virtual social interactions could be very beneficial in realizing their behavior. This research develops a system that uses social media posts to detect individuals' depression. Data mining techniques have been employed to analyze social media data to identify individuals at risk of depression. It provides an overview of the major contributions made in the field of depression detection based on social networking sites using several machine learning (ML), deep learning, and data mining. We discuss the use of sentiment analysis (SA), natural language processing (NLP), ML, user profiling, and early warning systems. The paper highlights the potential benefits of using social media data for depression detection, including the ability to provide early intervention to individuals at risk of depression. However, there are also ethical considerations to be addressed, such as ensuring data privacy and avoiding stigmatization. The bag of words (BoW) approach is effective in capturing the sentiment and emotional tone of social media posts, which is crucial for detecting depression. It employs Naïve Bayes (NB) classifier which is is known for its accuracy in classifying text data for detecting the depression level. The implemented approach is compared with other SA methods concerning performance and results. In many evaluation parameters, the proposed method outperforms other SA systems. The approach provides runtime provision for adding new keywords and sentiments which adapts the approach to work fine for newest trends, wordings, and formats of posts. It suggests actions to be undertaken in case of detection of depressed users to control them drowning in further stress. Overall, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current state of research in depression detection based on social networking sites using data mining, and the potential implications for mental health care. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.",2024,,Multimedia Tools and Applications,83,9,25951-25967,,10.1007/s11042-023-16564-7,,#193,Pande 2024,"",""
Multi-Region and Multi-Band Electroencephalogram Emotion Recognition Based on Self-Attention and Capsule Network,"Ke, S.; Ma, C.; Li, W.; Lv, J.; Zou, L.","Research on emotion recognition based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is important for human emotion detection and improvements in mental health. However, the importance of EEG signals from different brain regions and frequency bands for emotion recognition is different. For this problem, this paper proposes the Capsule–Transformer method for multi-region and multi-band EEG emotion recognition. First, the EEG features are extracted from different brain regions and frequency bands and combined into feature vectors which are input into the fully connected network for feature dimension alignment. Then, the feature vectors are inputted into the Transformer for calculating the self-attention of EEG features among different brain regions and frequency bands to obtain contextual information. Finally, utilizing capsule networks captures the intrinsic relationship between local and global features. It merges features from different brain regions and frequency bands, adaptively computing weights for each brain region and frequency band. Based on the DEAP dataset, experiments show that the Capsule–Transformer method achieves average classification accuracies of 96.75%, 96.88%, and 96.25% on the valence, arousal, and dominance dimensions, respectively. Furthermore, in emotion recognition experiments conducted on individual brain regions or frequency bands, it was observed that the frontal lobe exhibits the highest average classification accuracy, followed by the parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes. Additionally, emotion recognition performance is superior for high-frequency band EEG signals compared to low-frequency band signals. © 2024 by the authors.",2024,,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),14,2,,,10.3390/app14020702,,#197,Ke 2024,"",""

Assessment of Mental Workload Using a Transformer Network and Two Prefrontal EEG Channels: An Unparameterized Approach,"Beiramvand, M.; Shahbakhti, M.; Karttunen, N.; Koivula, R.; Turunen, J.; Lipping, T.","Despite promising results reported in the literature for mental workload assessment using electroencephalography (EEG), most of the proposed methods rely on employing multiple EEG channels, limiting their practicality. However, the advent of wearable EEG technology provides the possibility of mental workload assessment for real-life applications. Yet, a few studies that considered consumer-oriented EEG headsets for mental workload assessment only used a single database for validating the proposed methods, overlooking the potential for portability. In this research, we studied 60 recordings of participants playing a three-level n-back game, utilizing data from two EEG devices, Enobio and Muse, with distinctive characteristics such as sampling rate and channel configuration. Following the denoising of the EEG signals, we segmented the signals and applied the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to decompose them into subbands. Then, we extracted Shannon entropy (SE) and wavelet log energy (WLE) features from all subbands. Subsequently, we fed the extracted features into five classifiers: support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (kNNs), multilayer perceptron (MLP), AdaBoost, and the transformer network (TN). In comparing the results across all classifiers, the TN demonstrated superiority by achieving highest mean accuracy for Database M (88%) and Database E (85%). Given the consistent outcomes achieved with the TN classifier across both databases and utilizing a three-level n-back game, our findings indicate that the proposed method holds promise for real-life applications.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.",2024,,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,73,,1-10,,10.1109/TIM.2024.3395312,,#235,Beiramvand 2024,"",""
Associations between recorded loneliness and adverse mental health outcomes among patients receiving mental healthcare in South London: a retrospective cohort study,"Parmar, M.; Ma, R.; Attygalle, S.; Herath, M.D.; Mueller, C.; Stubbs, B.; Stewart, R.; Perera, G.","Purpose: Loneliness disproportionately affects people with mental disorders, but associations with mental health outcomes in groups affected remain less well understood. Method: A cohort of patients receiving mental healthcare on 30th June 2012 was assembled from a large mental health records database covering a south London catchment area. Recorded loneliness within the preceding 2 years was extracted using natural language processing and outcomes were measured between 30th June 2012 until 30th December 2019, except for survival which applied a censoring point of 6th December 2020 according to data available at the time of extraction. The following mental healthcare outcomes: (i) time to first crisis episode; (ii) time to first emergency presentation; (iii) all-cause mortality; (iv) days active to service per year; and (v) face-to-face contacts per year. Results: Loneliness was recorded in 4,483 (16.7%) patients in the study population and fully adjusted models showed associations with subsequent crisis episode (HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.07–1.29), emergency presentation (HR 1.30, 1.21–1.40), days active per year (IRR 1.04, 1.03–1.05), and face-to-face contacts per year (IRR 1.28, 1.27–1.30). Recorded loneliness in patients with substance misuse problems was particularly strongly associated with adverse outcomes, including risk of emergency presentation (HR 1.68, 1.29–2.18) and mortality (HR 1.29, 1.01–1.65). Conclusion: Patients receiving mental healthcare who are recorded as lonely have a higher risk of several adverse outcomes which may require a need for higher service input. © The Author(s) 2024.",2024,,Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology,,,,,10.1007/s00127-024-02663-9,,#237,Parmar 2024,"",""
A BERT-encoded ensembled CNN model for suicide risk identification in social media posts,"Gorai, J.; Shaw, D.K.","Suicide is a significant public health issue that devastates individuals and society. Early warning systems are crucial in preventing suicide. The purpose of this research is to create a deep learning model to identify suicide risk using a combination of bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) and an ensemble of multiple convolutional neural networks (CNN). BERT is used to encode the text data into numerical representations that capture the context-aware meaning of words and phrases, while ensemble CNN is used to analyze the encoded text data to identify patterns and relationships relevant to suicide risk. The model is trained on a large corpus of text data from social media and suicide notes and evaluated on a validation set of labeled data.

A natural language model to automate scoring of autobiographical memories,"Mistica, M.; Haylock, P.; Michalewicz, A.; Raad, S.; Fitzgerald, E.; Hitchcock, C.","Biases in the retrieval of personal, autobiographical memories are a core feature of multiple mental health disorders, and are associated with poor clinical prognosis. However, current assessments of memory bias are either reliant on human scoring, restricting their administration in clinical settings, or when computerized, are only able to identify one memory type. Here, we developed a natural language model able to classify text-based memories as one of five different autobiographical memory types (specific, categoric, extended, semantic associate, omission), allowing easy assessment of a wider range of memory biases, including reduced memory specificity and impaired memory flexibility. Our model was trained on 17,632 text-based, human-scored memories obtained from individuals with and without experience of memory bias and mental health challenges, which was then tested on a dataset of 5880 memories. We used 20-fold cross-validation setup, and the model was fine-tuned over BERT. Relative to benchmarking and an existing support vector model, our model achieved high accuracy (95.7%) and precision (91.0%).

Novel Transformer Based Contextualized Embedding and Probabilistic Features for Depression Detection From Social Media,"Abbas, M.A.; Munir, K.; Raza, A.; Samee, N.A.; Jamjoom, M.M.; Ullah, Z.","Depression constitutes a significant mental health condition, impacting an individual's emotional state, thought processes, and ability to carry out everyday tasks. Depression is defined by ongoing feelings of sadness, diminished interest in previously enjoyed activities, alterations in hunger, sleep disturbances, decreased vitality, and challenges with focus. The impact of depression extends beyond the individual, affecting society at large through decreased productivity and higher healthcare costs. In the realm of social media, users often express their thoughts and emotions through posts, which can provide insightful data for identifying patterns of depression. This research aims to detect depression early by analyzing social media user content with machine learning techniques. We have built advanced machine learning models using a benchmark depression database containing 20,000 tagged tweets from user profiles identified as depressed or non-depressed. We are introducing an innovative BERT-RF feature engineering method that extracts Contextualized Embeddings and Probabilistic Features from textual input. The Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model, based on the Transformer architecture, is used to extract Contextualized Embedding features. These features are then fed into a random forest model to generate class probabilistic features. These prominent features aid in enhancing the identification of depression from social media. In order to classify tweets using the features derived from the BERT-RF features selection step, we have used five popular classifiers: Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), K-Neighbors Classifier (KNC), Logistic Regression (LR), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Evaluation experiments show that our approach, using BERT-RF for feature engineering, enables the Logistic Regression model to outperform state-of-the-art methods with a high accuracy score of 99%. We have validated the results through k-fold cross-validation and statistical T-tests. We achieved 99% k-fold accuracy during the validation of the proposed approach.

Impact of Contradicting Subtle Emotion Cues on Large Language Models with Various Prompting Techniques,"Ul Huda, N.; Sahito, S.F.; Gilal, A.R.; Abro, A.; Alshanqiti, A.; Alsughayyir, A.; Palli, A.S.","The landscape of human-machine interaction is undergoing a transformation with the integration of conversational technologies. In various domains, Large Language Model (LLM) based chatbots are progressively taking on roles traditionally handled by human agents, such as task execution, answering queries, offering guidance, and delivering social and emotional assistance. Consequently, enhancing user satisfaction with these technologies is crucial for their effective incorporation. Emotions indeed play an effective role in responses generated by reinforcement-learning-based chatbots. In text-based prompts, emotions can be signaled by visual (emojis, emoticons) and linguistic (misspellings, tone of voice, word choice, sentence length, similes) aspects. Therefore, researchers are harnessing the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing techniques to imbue chatbots with emotional intelligence capabilities. This research aims to explore the impact of feeding contradicting emotional cues to the LLMs through different prompting techniques. The evaluation is based on specified instructions versus provided emotional signals. Each prompting technique is scrutinized by inducing a variety of emotions on widely used LLMs, ChatGPT 3.5 and Gemini. Instead of automating the prompting process, the prompts are given by exerting cognitive load to be more realistic regarding Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). The responses are evaluated using human-provided qualitative insights. The results indicate that simile-based cues have the highest impact in both ChatGPT and Gemini. However, results also conclude that the Gemini is more sensitive towards emotional cues.

Predicting Postpartum Depression with Aid of Social Media Texts Using Optimized Machine Learning Model,"Suganthi, D.; Geetha, A.","Post-Partum Depression (PPD) is a significant medical condition that occurs in some women after childbirth as a consequence of physiological behavioral and mental alterations. The complicated symptoms of this condition make it difficult to diagnose and differentiate from other conditions. Timely detection and diagnosis of PPD are crucial for controlling morality rates and ensuring effective treatment. Various Machine Learning (ML) models was developed to predict PPD based on the patients demographic status, mental health history and vital signs. But, additional psychological attributes are needed for predicting mental status and identifying individuals with PPD risk. Also, costeffective and innovative methods are needed to identify individuals with PPD and detect potential development tendencies. Hence, in this paper, Osprey Parameter Optimized MLP (OPOMLP) is developed to address the above issues for efficient PPD. Initially, the Application Programming Interface (API) function of online social network like Twitter (tweets) and Instagram (comments) are used to collect the data posted by health care professionals. Then, Natural Language Processing (NLP) is utilized to pre-process the collected data \and extract relevant text of Twitter users to estimate PPD phases. The additional psychological attributes like mental health and behavioural changes attributes of women are extracted using Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) methods. Next, MLP network is trained using the extracted attributes along with the attributes of demographic status, mental health history and vital signs. Since, the parameters of MLP were not optimized properly which leads to computational complexities in the PPD prediction. So, the weights initialization and the hyper-parameters of MLP is optimized simultaneously by using an Osprey Optimization Algorithm (OOA). OOA is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm derived from osprey bird hunting behavior which aims to find the global optimum solutions and reduces the complex optimization issues. The relationship between hyperparameters and classification performance will identify an optimal hyperparameter space regions for optimal classification with less computational time and resources. Finally, the OPOMLP is employed for the final prediction of PPD. The test outcomes reveal that the OPOMLP model achieves an accuracy of 96.12% on the collected dataset compared to the classical PPD detection models. © (2024), (Intelligent Network and Systems Society).

DepBoost-TransNet: Boosted Transformer Network for Depression Classification,"Anil Rahood, P.; Kumaresan, P.K.; Chakravarthi, B.R.","Depression presents a significant global mental health challenge affecting countless individuals across the globe. Early detection is of paramount importance, yet conventional methods, such as self-reporting and professional evaluations, possess inherent limitations and subjectivity. With the proliferation of social media and the abundance of user-generated content, novel approaches employing transformer-based models and text-mining techniques hold the potential to reveal signs of depression within social media text. This study delves into the efficacy of transformer-based models and natural language processing techniques in recognizing depressive symptoms within social media text. Social media serves as a distinct window into mental well-being, and this investigation explores the utilization of advanced transformers to tackle this issue. Results indicate that transformers trained on imbalanced datasets outperform those employing data augmentation techniques, like SMOTE, due to their proficiency in discerning intricate patterns and sensitivity to synthetic data. Furthermore, the ensemble model, which amalgamates predictions from multiple transformer models, surpasses individual models, underscoring the potential of harnessing the diverse strengths of these models for enhanced depression classification.

Detection of Cyberbullying in Social Media Texts Using Explainable Artificial Intelligence,"Islam, M.R.; Bataineh, A.S.; Zulkernine, M.","The widespread use of social media has opened the door to new forms of harassment and abuse, such as cyberbullying, that have a serious impact on individuals’ psychological health. Therefore, research communities have recently developed detection approaches using Natural Language Processing (NLP) combined with machine learning algorithms to identify instances of cyberbullying in social media texts. However, they are unable to determine the type of cyberbullying and the reasons why victims may be targeted. This paper develops a novel detection approach that can identify the type of cyberbullying based on characteristics such as gender, religion, age, and ethnicity, even if the original records in the training dataset do not include such information or features. This paper has accomplished this objective by utilizing Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) technology alongside machine learning models to justify and explain the classification of text as cyberbullying. Technically speaking, XAI technology enables machine learning models to capture and highlight the most influential words that affect the decision to classify a text as cyberbullying. Those influential words are utilized to re-label and update the training data. The machine learning models are then re-trained using the updated data. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, a simulation experiment has been conducted on a large dataset containing texts from Twitter. Simulation results show that XAI technology provides convincing explanations for classifying a text as cyberbullying. It also enables machine learning models to identify various types of cyberbullying and enhances their performance in terms of classification accuracy. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",2024,,Communications in Computer and Information Science,2034 CCIS,,319-334,,10.1007/978-981-97-1274-8_21,,#286,Islam 2024,"",""

Here we present a retrospective, real-world, cohort study using electronic health records, adhering to RECORD guidelines. Natural language processing algorithms were used to extract monthly occurrences of 65 prodromal features (symptoms and substance use), grouped into eight prodromal clusters. The duration, first presentation, and transdiagnosticity of the prodrome were compared between SMD groups with one-way ANOVA, Cohen’s f and d. The time course (mean occurrences) of prodromal clusters was compared between SMD groups with linear mixed-effects models. 26,975 individuals diagnosed with ICD-10 SMD were followed up for up to 12 years (UMD = 13,422; BMD = 2506; PSY = 11,047; median[IQR] age 39.8[23.7] years; 55% female; 52% white). The duration of the UMD prodrome (18[36] months) was shorter than BMD (26[35], d = 0.21) and PSY (24[38], d = 0.18). Most individuals presented with multiple first prodromal clusters, with the most common being non-specific (‘other’; 88% UMD, 85% BMD, 78% PSY). The only first prodromal cluster that showed a medium-sized difference between the three SMD groups was positive symptoms (f = 0.30). Time course analysis showed an increase in prodromal cluster occurrences approaching SMD onset. Feature occurrence across the prodromal period showed small/negligible differences between SMD groups, suggesting that most features are transdiagnostic, except for positive symptoms (e.g. paranoia, f = 0.40). Taken together, our findings show minimal differences in the duration and first presentation of the SMD prodromes as recorded in secondary mental health care. All the prodromal clusters intensified as individuals approached SMD onset, and all the prodromal features other than positive symptoms are transdiagnostic.

More importantly, we aimed to understand the specific theory-driven factors contributing to the ML prediction of suicide risk. Method: The dataset consisted of 17,654 crisis hotline chat sessions classified dichotomously as suicidal or not. We created a suicide risk factors-based lexicon (SRF), which encompasses language representations of key risk factors derived from the main suicide theories. The ML model (Suicide Risk-Bert; SR-BERT) was trained using natural language processing techniques incorporating the SRF lexicon. Results: The results showed that SR-BERT outperformed the other models. Logistic regression analysis identified several theory-driven risk factors significantly associated with suicide risk, the prominent ones were hopelessness, history of suicide, self-harm, and thwarted belongingness. Limitations: The lexicon is limited in its ability to fully encompass all theoretical concepts related to suicide risk, nor to all the language expressions of each concept. The classification of chats was determined by trained but non-professionals in metal health.

Attention and Meta-Heuristic Based General Self-Efficacy Prediction Model from Multimodal Social Media Dataset,"Mukta, M.S.H.; Ahmad, J.; Zaman, A.; Islam, S.","General Self-Efficacy (GSE) is a vital attribute of human psychology that describes one's belief about his own ability to succeed in specific situations. GSE is composed of cognitive, social, and behavioral skills of an individual. In this research, we first develop a GSE classification model by using Facebook content (i.e., profile photos and statuses). We collect data from a total of 435 Facebook users in an ethical data collection manner. Two hybrid machine learning methods are applied based on distinct feature extraction approaches: tool-based and deep learning-based. In our tool-based approach, we employ Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) for text and Mediapipe and DeepFace for image feature extraction. We apply Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for feature selection, resulting in a robust tabular dataset with high predictive performance for GSE scores. In the deep learning-based approach, we apply BERT and 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) for text feature extraction, while UNet++ handles image segmentation, and VGG16 and ResNet-152 contribute image features, fused via Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). We also integrate a co-attention model for image and text features. Traditional machine learning models, including Random Forest (RF), Xgboost, AdaBoost, and Stacking, are then trained on the feature set to predict GSE scores.

Emotional Support Dialog System Through Recursive Interactions Among Large Language Models,"Chen, K.; Lian, H.; Gao, Y.; Li, Y.","Emotional Support is one of the crucial abilities for multi-turn conversations, especially in the tasks of counseling and mental health support. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown their significant potential in emotional support conversations. However, despite the impressive reasoning capabilities and extensive knowledge of LLMs, they fall short in using strategy and achieving overall goals in multi-turn counseling conversations. Such issues make LLMs difficult to apply directly to multi-turn emotional support conversations. To address these limitations, we propose the Supportive Psychotherapy Dialog System (STDS), which is based on widely-accepted supportive psychotherapy in mental health. Our system first employs an interactive framework that integrates both the Domain-Specific LLM and the Foundational LLM. The former is equipped with domain knowledge of emotional support strategy, while the latter boasts strong reasoning capabilities and world knowledge. By interacting, our framework synergistically leverages the strengths of both models. Furthermore, we have integrated recursive units to maintain the continuity of dialogue strategy, working toward the overall goals of the entire conversation. The experiment was conducted using the open-source dataset ESConv, and the results showed that our system’s responses have improved in terms of empathy, coherence, and helpfulness when compared to baseline models. Additionally, our approach exhibited an enhanced ability to establish rapport with clients, thereby improving the effectiveness of emotional support through supportive psychotherapy strategy. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",2024,,Communications in Computer and Information Science,2006,,151-163,,10.1007/978-981-97-0601-3_13,,#319,Chen 2024,"",""
IFM-RCNN: a hybrid text classifier with enhanced performance of binary drug classification from tweets using improved faster mask-recurrent convolutional neural network,"Lavanya, P.M.; Sasikala, E.","The significant growth of social media and online websites helps to garner a significant amount of healthcare data and contributes toward the development of the healthcare industry. Authorized health assets, which include specialized healthcare authorities, medical professionals, substandard monitoring and diagnosing equipment, and pharmaceuticals, became insufficient during the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic in 2019. Social networks have played a significant role in selling drugs during those times. However, the risk of drug abuse is increased, and also there occurs several challenges in the management and detection of drug activities. This research will focus on identifying relevant features in the drug database by developing a new target label model using deep learning approaches. This helps in avoiding unbalanced data, which in turn results in enhanced overall performance. The objective of this work is to address uneven classification performance by using social media comments as input in order to improve the accuracy of the training model. A new powerful hybrid machine learning method to extract clinical terms from customer feedback and learn the system by categorizing medical conditions and drug names is developed in this work.

However, digital educational technology has yet to catch up as automated feedback is often provided shallowly. This paper presents a case study on implementing a pipeline that provides German-speaking university students enrolled in an introductory-level educational psychology lecture with content-specific feedback for a lecture assignment. In the assignment, students have to discuss the usefulness and educational grounding (i.e., connection to working memory, metacognition or motivation) of ten learning tips presented in a video within essays. Through our system, students received feedback on the correctness of their solutions and content areas they needed to improve. For this purpose, we implemented a natural language processing pipeline with two steps: (1) segmenting the essays and (2) predicting codes from the resulting segments used to generate feedback texts. As training data for the model in each processing step, we used 689 manually labelled essays submitted by the previous student cohort. We then evaluated approaches based on GBERT, T5, and bag-of-words baselines for scoring them. Both pipeline steps, especially the transformer-based models, demonstrated high performance. In the final step, we evaluated the feedback using a randomised controlled trial. The control group received feedback as usual (essential feedback), while the treatment group received highly informative feedback based on the natural language processing pipeline. We then used a six items long survey to test the perception of feedback.

FPT-Former: A Flexible Parallel Transformer of Recognizing Depression by Using Audiovisual Expert-Knowledge-Based Multimodal Measures,"Li, Y.; Yang, X.; Zhao, M.; Wang, Z.; Yao, Y.; Qian, W.; Qi, S.","Background and Objective. Currently, depression is a widespread global issue that imposes a significant burden and disability on individuals, families, and society. Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a valuable approach for automatically detecting depression by extracting cues from audiovisual data and making a diagnosis. PHQ-8 is considered a validated diagnostic tool for depressive disorders in clinical studies, and the objective of this experiment is to improve the accuracy of PHQ-8 prediction. Furthermore, this paper aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of expert knowledge in depression diagnosis and discuss a novel multimodal network architecture. Methods. This research paper focuses on multimodal depression analysis, proposing a flexible parallel transformer (FPT) model capable of extracting data from three distinct modalities (i.e., one video and two audio descriptors). The FPT-Former model incorporates three paths, each using expert-knowledge-based descriptors from one modality as inputs. These descriptors are represented into 32 features by the encoder part of a transformer module, and these features are fused to realize the final regression of PHQ-8 score. The extended distress analysis interview corpus (E-DAIC) is an expansion of WOZ-DAIC which comprises semiclinical interviews intended to assist in the diagnosis of psychological distress conditions. It encompasses a sample size of 275 participants, and in this study, it was utilized to test the model in a way of 10-fold cross-validation. Results. The FPT presented herein achieved comparable performance to the state-of-the-art works, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.80 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.58. The ablation experiments demonstrate that the three-modality-fused model outperforms other two-modality-fused and single-modality models. While using a PHQ-8 score threshold of 10, the accuracy of the depression classification is 0.79. Conclusions. Leveraging the strength of expert-knowledge-based multimodal measures and parallel transformer structure, the FPT model exhibits promising performance in depression detection. This model improved the accuracy of depression diagnosis through audio and video, and it also proved the effectiveness of using expert-knowledge in the diagnosis of depression. The traits of flexible structure, high predictive efficiency, and secure privacy protection make our model a promotable intelligent system in mental healthcare. © 2024 Yifu Li et al.",2024,,International Journal of Intelligent Systems,2024,,,,10.1155/2024/1564574,,#337,Li 2024,"",""

For thorough evaluation, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, Confusion Matrix and Accuracy-Loss graphs were utilized. Furthermore, generalizability of employed models was testified and evaluated by in-depth inspections. The process was accomplished by activating manual input test, cross dataset test and k-fold cross validation procedures. In the course of scrutinizing, the proposed BiGRU-CNN model outperformed the traditional DL and ML models with consistent and reliable performance. Correspondingly, the proposed model achieved accuracies of 93.07% and 92.47% on the respective datasets which advocate its potential as a tool for the early detection of suicidal thought. © 2024, Science and Information Organization.

Developing a Framework to Infer Opioid Use Disorder Severity From Clinical Notes to Inform Natural Language Processing Methods: Characterization Study,"Poulsen, M.N.; Freda, P.J.; Troiani, V.; Mowery, D.L.","Background: Information regarding opioid use disorder (OUD) status and severity is important for patient care. Clinical notes provide valuable information for detecting and characterizing problematic opioid use, necessitating development of natural language processing (NLP) tools, which in turn requires reliably labeled OUD-relevant text and understanding of documentation patterns. Objective: To inform automated NLP methods, we aimed to develop and evaluate an annotation schema for characterizing OUD and its severity, and to document patterns of OUD-relevant information within clinical notes of heterogeneous patient cohorts. Methods: We developed an annotation schema to characterize OUD severity based on criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition. In total, 2 annotators reviewed clinical notes from key encounters of 100 adult patients with varied evidence of OUD, including patients with and those without chronic pain, with and without medication treatment for OUD, and a control group. We completed annotations at the sentence level. We calculated severity scores based on annotation of note text with 18 classes aligned with criteria for OUD severity and determined positive predictive values for OUD severity. Results: The annotation schema contained 27 classes. We annotated 1436 sentences from 82 patients; notes of 18 patients (11 of whom were controls) contained no relevant information. Interannotator agreement was above 70% for 11 of 15 batches of reviewed notes. Severity scores for control group patients were all 0. Among noncontrol patients, the mean severity score was 5.1 (SD 3.2), indicating moderate OUD, and the positive predictive value for detecting moderate or severe OUD was 0.71. Progress notes and notes from emergency department and outpatient settings contained the most and greatest diversity of information. Substance misuse and psychiatric classes were most prevalent and highly correlated across note types with high co-occurrence across patients. Conclusions: Implementation of the annotation schema demonstrated strong potential for inferring OUD severity based on key information in a small set of clinical notes and highlighting where such information is documented. These advancements will facilitate NLP tool development to improve OUD prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. © 2024 JMIR Publications Inc..

Multi-Class Multi-Level Classification of Mental Health Disorders Based on Textual Data from Social Media,"Sutranggono, A.N.; Sarno, R.; Ghozali, I.","Mental health disorders pose a significant global public health challenge. Social media data provides insights into these conditions. Analysing text can help identify indications of mental health disorders through text-based analysis. However, despite the large number of studies on the analysis of mental health disorders, the predominant algorithm in the existing literature is the Multi-Class Single-Level (MCSL) classification algorithm, which is often used for simple classification tasks involving a limited number of classes. Typically, these classes are binary, representing either an unhealthy or a healthy mental state. This paper uses English text data from Reddit to classify mental health disorders. The Multi-Class Multi-Level (MCML) classification algorithm was applied to perform detailed classification and address the limitations of the research scope using several approaches, including machine learning, deep learning, and transfer learning approaches. Two different pre-processing scenarios were proposed to handle unstructured text data, one of the most challenging aspects of classifying text from social media. The results of the experiments show that the MCML classification algorithm successfully performs detailed classification and produces promising results for each classification level. The proposed pre-processing scenario influences the performance of each classifier and improves classification accuracy. The best accuracy results were obtained for the Robustly Optimised BERT Pre-training Approach (RoBERTa) classifier at level 1 and level 2 classifications, namely 0.98 and 0.85, respectively. Overall, the MCML classification algorithm is proven to be used as a benchmark for early detection of text-based mental health disorders. © (2023), (Universiti Utara Malaysia Press).

Validation of the Enhanced Opioid Identification and Co-occurring Disorders Algorithms,"Brown, A.M.; White, D.G.; Adams, N.B.; Badwe, R.; Shaikh, S.; Guluma, L.","Objectives This report documents the results of a validation study conducted to assess the reliability of two algorithms applied to the 2016 National Hospital Care Survey. One algorithm identifies opioid-involved and opioid overdose hospital encounters, and the other identifies encounters with patients that have substance use disorders and selected mental health issues. These algorithms use both medical codes and natural language processing to identify encounters. Methods To validate the algorithms, medical record abstraction was performed on a stratified sample of 900 hospital encounters from the 2016 National Hospital Care Survey. The abstractors recorded their determinations of opioid involvement, opioid overdose, substance use disorder, and mental health issues on a standard form. Abstractors’ determinations were compared with algorithm output to assess the overall performance using F-score and Matthews correlation coefficient. The latter provided a secondary measure of performance. The 2016 National Hospital Care Survey data are unweighted and not nationally representative. Results Overall algorithm performance varied by topic and by metric. The opioid-involvement algorithm achieved the highest performance, performing well with an F-score of 0.95, followed by the substance use disorder algorithm (F-score of 0.79), the mental health issues algorithm (F-score of 0.68), and the opioid overdose algorithm (F-score of 0.48). Assessment by Matthews correlation coefficient indicated an overall poorer level of performance, ranging from a high of 0.57 for the mental health issues algorithm to a low of 0.33 for the opioid-involvement algorithm. The causes of false positives and false negatives likewise varied, including both overly broad code and keyword inclusions as well as incompleteness of data submitted to the National Hospital Care Survey. Conclusion The validation study illustrates which aspects of the developed algorithms performed well and which aspects should be altered or discarded in future iterations. It further emphasizes the importance of data completeness, therefore laying the groundwork for improvements to future survey analyses. © 2024, National Center for Health Statistics.

Mental Health Counseling from Conversational Content with Transformer-Based Machine Learning,"Imel, Z.E.; Tanana, M.J.; Soma, C.S.; Hull, T.D.; Pace, B.T.; Stanco, S.C.; Creed, T.A.; Moyers, T.B.; Atkins, D.C.","Importance: Use of asynchronous text-based counseling is rapidly growing as an easy-to-access approach to behavioral health care. Similar to in-person treatment, it is challenging to reliably assess as measures of process and content do not scale. Objective: To use machine learning to evaluate clinical content and client-reported outcomes in a large sample of text-based counseling episodes of care. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this quality improvement study, participants received text-based counseling between 2014 and 2019; data analysis was conducted from September 22, 2022, to November 28, 2023. The deidentified content of messages was retained as a part of ongoing quality assurance. Treatment was asynchronous text-based counseling via an online and mobile therapy app (Talkspace). Therapists were licensed to provide mental health treatment and were either independent contractors or employees of the product company. Participants were self-referred via online sign-up and received services via their insurance or self-pay and were assigned a diagnosis from their health care professional. Exposure: All clients received counseling services from a licensed mental health clinician. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were client engagement in counseling (number of weeks), treatment satisfaction, and changes in client symptoms, measured via the 8-item version of Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8). A previously trained, transformer-based, deep learning model automatically categorized messages into types of therapist interventions and summaries of clinical content. Results: The total sample included 166644 clients treated by 4973 therapists (20600274 messages). Participating clients were predominantly female (75.23%), aged 26 to 35 years (55.4%), single (37.88%), earned a bachelor's degree (59.13%), and were White (61.8%). There was substantial variability in intervention use and treatment content across therapists. A series of mixed-effects regressions indicated that collectively, interventions and clinical content were associated with key outcomes: engagement (multiple R = 0.43), satisfaction (multiple R = 0.46), and change in PHQ-8 score (multiple R = 0.13). Conclusions and Relevance: This quality improvement study found associations between therapist interventions, clinical content, and client-reported outcomes. Consistent with traditional forms of counseling, higher amounts of supportive counseling were associated with improved outcomes. These findings suggest that machine learning-based evaluations of content may increase the scale and specificity of psychotherapy research.. © 2024 American Medical Association.

"Generative AI for Transformative Healthcare: A Comprehensive Study of Emerging Models, Applications, Case Studies, and Limitations","Sai, S.; Gaur, A.; Sai, R.; Chamola, V.; Guizani, M.; Rodrigues, J.J.P.C.","Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) can be broadly described as an artificial intelligence system capable of generating images, text, and other media types with human prompts. GAI models like ChatGPT, DALL-E, and Bard have recently caught the attention of industry and academia equally. GAI applications span various industries like art, gaming, fashion, and healthcare. In healthcare, GAI shows promise in medical research, diagnosis, treatment, and patient care and is already making strides in real-world deployments. There has yet to be any detailed study concerning the applications and scope of GAI in healthcare. Addressing this research gap, we explore several applications, real-world scenarios, and limitations of GAI in healthcare. We examine how GAI models like ChatGPT and DALL-E can be leveraged to aid in the applications of medical imaging, drug discovery, personalized patient treatment, medical simulation and training, clinical trial optimization, mental health support, healthcare operations and research, medical chatbots, human movement simulation, and a few more applications. Along with applications, we cover four real-world healthcare scenarios that employ GAI: visual snow syndrome diagnosis, molecular drug optimization, medical education, and dentistry. We also provide an elaborate discussion on seven healthcare-customized LLMs like Med-PaLM, BioGPT, DeepHealth, etc.,Since GAI is still evolving, it poses challenges like the lack of professional expertise in decision making, risk of patient data privacy, issues in integrating with existing healthcare systems, and the problem of data bias which are elaborated on in this work along with several other challenges.

Identifying clinical phenotypes of frontotemporal dementia in post-9/11 era veterans using natural language processing,"Panahi, S.; Mayo, J.; Kennedy, E.; Christensen, L.; Kamineni, S.; Sagiraju, H.K.R.; Cooper, T.; Tate, D.F.; Rupper, R.; Pugh, M.J.","Introduction: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) encompasses a clinically and pathologically diverse group of neurodegenerative disorders, yet little work has quantified the unique phenotypic clinical presentations of FTD among post-9/11 era veterans. To identify phenotypes of FTD using natural language processing (NLP) aided medical chart reviews of post-9/11 era U.S. military Veterans diagnosed with FTD in Veterans Health Administration care. Methods: A medical record chart review of clinician/provider notes was conducted using a Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool, which extracted features related to cognitive dysfunction. NLP features were further organized into seven Research Domain Criteria Initiative (RDoC) domains, which were clustered to identify distinct phenotypes. Results: Veterans with FTD were more likely to have notes that reflected the RDoC domains, with cognitive and positive valence domains showing the greatest difference across groups. Clustering of domains identified three symptom phenotypes agnostic to time of an individual having FTD, categorized as Low (16.4%), Moderate (69.2%), and High (14.5%) distress. Comparison across distress groups showed significant differences in physical and psychological characteristics, particularly prior history of head injury, insomnia, cardiac issues, anxiety, and alcohol misuse. The clustering result within the FTD group demonstrated a phenotype variant that exhibited a combination of language and behavioral symptoms. This phenotype presented with manifestations indicative of both language-related impairments and behavioral changes, showcasing the coexistence of features from both domains within the same individual. Discussion: This study suggests FTD also presents across a continuum of severity and symptom distress, both within and across variants. The intensity of distress evident in clinical notes tends to cluster with more co-occurring conditions. This examination of phenotypic heterogeneity in clinical notes indicates that sensitivity to FTD diagnosis may be correlated to overall symptom distress, and future work incorporating NLP and phenotyping may help promote strategies for early detection of FTD.

Deep Depression Detection Based on Feature Fusion and Result Fusion,"Gao, H.; Zhou, Y.; Chen, L.; Chi, K.","Depression, as a severe mental disorder, has significant impacts on individuals, families, and society. Accurate depression detection is of great significance. To this end, we propose a deep depression detection based on feature fusion and result fusion. We have introduced a dataset consisting of answers that correspond to four questions. Using the answers to the first three questions provided by the patients, we propose a text feature extraction method based on a pre-trained BERT model and an improved TextCNN model to extract features and introduce an attention mechanism for feature fusion. The vector obtained by fusing the features of the first three questions is inputted into a classifier to obtain classification results. These results, along with the classification results obtained from the fourth question, are fused using result fusion techniques to obtain the final outcome. To evaluate our method, we conducted experiments on the dataset collected from the specialized hospital for mental illness. We compare our depression detection algorithm with mainstream ones. Our method achieves an accuracy of 94.2% on our dataset. The results show that our method achieves an accuracy rate of 7.7% higher than the highest accuracy rate among the compared mainstream models. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",2024,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),14428 LNCS,,64-74,,10.1007/978-981-99-8462-6_6,,#385,Gao 2024,"",""

This study aims to detect cyberbullying on social media in alignment with the third sustainable development goal (SDG) for health and well-being. Many previous studies employ single-level classification, but this research introduces a multi-class multi-level (MCML) algorithm for a more detailed approach. The MCML approach incorporates two levels of classification: level one for cyberbullying or not cyberbullying, and level two for classifying cyberbullying by type. This study used a dataset of 47,000 tweets from Twitter with six class labels and employed an 80:20 training and testing data split. By integrating bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) and MCML at level two, we achieved a remarkable 99% accuracy, surpassing BERT-based single-level classification at 94%.

"Trajectories of sentiment in 11,816 psychoactive narratives","Friedman, S.F.; Ballentine, G.","Objective: Can machine learning (ML) enable data-driven discovery of how changes in sentiment correlate with different psychoactive experiences? We investigate by training models directly on text testimonials from a diverse 52-drug pharmacopeia. Methods: Using large language models (i.e. BERT) and 11,816 publicly-available testimonials, we predicted 28-dimensions of sentiment across each narrative, and then validated these predictions with adjudication by a clinical psychiatrist. BERT was then fine-tuned to predict biochemical and demographic information from these narratives. Lastly, canonical correlation analysis linked the drugs' receptor affinities with word usage, revealing 11 statistically-significant latent receptor-experience factors, each mapped to a 3D cortical Atlas. Results: These methods elucidate a neurobiologically-informed, sequence-sensitive portrait of drug-induced subjective experiences. The models' results converged, revealing a pervasive distinction between the universal psychedelic heights of feeling in contrast to the grim, mundane, and personal experiences of addiction and mental illness. Notably, MDMA was linked to “Love”, DMT and 5-MeO-DMT to “Mystical Experiences” and “Entities and Beings”, and other tryptamines to “Surprise”, “Curiosity” and “Realization"". Conclusions: ML methods can create unified and robust quantifications of subjective experiences with many different psychoactive substances and timescales.

We developed DeepBiomarker2 by leveraging deep learning and natural language processing to analyze lab tests, medication use, diagnosis, social determinants of health (SDoH) parameters, and psychotherapy for outcome prediction. To increase the model’s interpretability, we further refined our contribution analysis to identify key features by scaling with a factor from a reference feature. We applied DeepBiomarker2 to analyze the EMR data of 38,807 patients from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to determine their risk of developing alcohol and substance use disorder (ASUD). DeepBiomarker2 predicted whether a PTSD patient would have a diagnosis of ASUD within the following 3 months with an average c-statistic (receiver operating characteristic AUC) of 0.93 and average F1 score, precision, and recall of 0.880, 0.895, and 0.866 in the test sets, respectively.

A prediction model may assist physicians and health care workers in the early identification of these vulnerable patients. Objective: This study aimed to develop a prediction model for depression risk within the first month of cancer treatment. Methods: We included 16,159 patients diagnosed with cancer starting chemo- or radiotherapy treatment between 2008 and 2021. Machine learning models (eg, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator [LASSO] logistic regression) and natural language processing models (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers [BERT]) were used to develop multimodal prediction models using both electronic health record data and unstructured text (patient emails and clinician notes). Model performance was assessed in an independent test set (n=5387, 33%) using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), calibration curves, and decision curve analysis to assess initial clinical impact use. Results: Among 16,159 patients, 437 (2.7%) received a depression diagnosis within the first month of treatment. The LASSO logistic regression models based on the structured data (AUROC 0.74, 95% CI 0.71-0.78) and structured data with email classification scores (AUROC 0.74, 95% CI 0.71-0.78) had the best discriminative performance. The BERT models based on clinician notes and structured data with email classification scores had AUROCs around 0.71. The logistic regression model based on email classification scores alone performed poorly (AUROC 0.54, 95% CI 0.52-0.56), and the model based solely on clinician notes had the worst performance (AUROC 0.50, 95% CI 0.49-0.52). Calibration was good for the logistic regression models, whereas the BERT models produced overly extreme risk estimates even after recalibration. There was a small range of decision thresholds for which the best-performing model showed promising clinical effectiveness use. The risks were underestimated for female and Black patients.

Recently, Video Vision Transformers have emerged as a powerful deep learning architecture for analysing sequential data, such as video data. While vision transformers have primarily gained attention in computer vision tasks involving images, their application to video analysis tasks, such as the recognition of depression or the estimation of depression severity from facial video data, is an active area of research. In this paper, two different architectures of vision transformers are used to capture spatio-temporal, facial information relevant to estimating the severity of depression and, thus, to provide valuable insights for depression analysis. The models are trained and evaluated on the AVEC2013 and AVEC2014 datasets.

Harnessing AI to Optimize Thought Records and Facilitate Cognitive Restructuring in Smartphone CBT: An Exploratory Study,"Furukawa, T.A.; Iwata, S.; Horikoshi, M.; Sakata, M.; Toyomoto, R.; Luo, Y.; Tajika, A.; Kudo, N.; Aramaki, E.","Background: Effective cognitive restructuring (CR) requires identification of automatic thoughts that underlie experienced emotions. However, accurate recording of thoughts and emotions is challenging when CR is provided in internet cognitive-behavior therapy (iCBT). This study investigated the potential use of the artificial intelligence (AI) including the natural language processing (NLP) to facilitate CR offered in iCBT. Methods: We applied the Japanese Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5), one of the most advanced Large Language Models for the NLP,to records of thought-feeling pairs provided by participants in two randomized controlled trials of iCBT. We conducted threefold cross-validated prediction of self-reported feelings based on recorded thoughts. We examined the validity of the predictions by checking them against the human expert judgments and by the efficacy when the thought records were subjected to CR. Results: 1626 participants provided 4369 though-feeling records. The overall prediction accuracy was 73.5%. The self-reported feelings matched the human expert judgments more frequently when they were correctly predicted by the T5 than not (90% vs 37.5%, 95%CI of difference: 34.8 to 70.2%). When subjected to CR, the correctly predicted thought-feeling pairs led to greater reductions in negative feelings than the incorrectly predicted pairs (− 1.54 vs − 1.43 on a scale of 0 to 5, 95%CI of difference: 0.03 to 0.19). Conclusions: A new CR module of an iCBT application can incorporate this model and advise the users to revisit and revise their automatic thoughts to reflect their feelings more accurately. Whether such an iCBT application can ultimately lead to greater reductions in depression is to be examined in a future randomized trial. © 2023, The Author(s).",2023,,Cognitive Therapy and Research,47,6,887-893,,10.1007/s10608-023-10411-7,,#401,Furukawa 2023,"",""

Methods: Two academic memory clinic cohorts were used: the Amsterdam UMC (n = 3001) and the Erasmus MC (n = 646). Patients included in these cohorts had MCI, AD dementia, or mixed AD/VaD dementia. Ten trained clinicians annotated 13 types of NPS in a randomly selected training set of n = 500 EHRs from the Amsterdam UMC cohort and in a test set of n = 250 EHRs from the Erasmus MC cohort. For each NPS, a generalized linear classifier was trained and internally and externally validated. Prevalence estimates of NPS were adjusted for the imperfect sensitivity and specificity of each classifier. Intra-individual comparison of the NPS classified in EHRs and NPS reported on the NPI were conducted in a subsample (59%). Results: Internal validation performance of the classifiers was excellent (AUC range: 0.81–0.91), but external validation performance decreased (AUC range: 0.51–0.93). NPS were prevalent in EHRs from the Amsterdam UMC, especially apathy (adjusted prevalence = 69.4%), anxiety (adjusted prevalence = 53.7%), aberrant motor behavior (adjusted prevalence = 47.5%), irritability (adjusted prevalence = 42.6%), and depression (adjusted prevalence = 38.5%). The ranking of NPS was similar for EHRs from the Erasmus MC, although not all classifiers obtained valid prevalence estimates due to low specificity. In both cohorts, there was minimal agreement between NPS classified in the EHRs and NPS reported on the NPI (all kappa coefficients < 0.28), with substantially more reports of NPS in EHRs than on NPI assessments. Conclusions: NLP classifiers performed well in detecting a wide range of NPS in EHRs of patients with symptomatic AD visiting the memory clinic and showed that clinicians frequently reported NPS in these EHRs. Clinicians generally reported more NPS in EHRs than caregivers reported on the NPI. © 2023, The Author(s).",2023,,Alzheimer's Research and Therapy,15,1,,,10.1186/s13195-023-01240-7,,#404,Eikelboom 2023,"",""
A System for Interviewing and Collecting Statements Based on Intent Classification and Named Entity Recognition Using Augmentation,"Shin, J.; Jo, E.; Yoon, Y.; Jung, J.","In cases of child sexual abuse, interviewing and obtaining trustworthy statements from victims and witnesses is essential because their statements are the only evidence. It is crucial to ascertain objectively the credibility of the victim’s statements, which may vary based on the nature of the questions posed by the forensic interviewer. Therefore, interview skills that eliminate subjective opinions require a high level of training for forensic interviewers. To reduce high-risk subjective interviews, objectively analyzing statements is essential. Understanding the victim’s intent and named entity recognition (NER) in the statements is necessary to give the victim open-ended questions and memory recall. Therefore, the system provides an intent classification and NER method that follows the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Investigative Interview Protocol, which outlines the collection of objective statements. Large language models such as BERT and KoBERT, along with data augmentation techniques, were proposed using a restricted training dataset of limited size to achieve effective intent classification and NER performance. Additionally, a system that can collect objective statements with the proposed model was developed and it was confirmed that it could assist statement analysts. The verification results showed that the model achieved average F1-scores of 95.5% and 97.8% for intent classification and NER, respectively, which improved the results of the limited data by 3.4% and 3.7%, respectively. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),13,20,,,10.3390/app132011545,,#407,Shin 2023,"",""

The now and future of ChatGPT and GPT in psychiatry,"Cheng, S.-W.; Chang, C.-W.; Chang, W.-J.; Wang, H.-W.; Liang, C.-S.; Kishimoto, T.; Chang, J.P.-C.; Kuo, J.S.; Su, K.-P.","ChatGPT has sparked extensive discussions within the healthcare community since its November 2022 release. However, potential applications in the field of psychiatry have received limited attention. Deep learning has proven beneficial to psychiatry, and GPT is a powerful deep learning-based language model with immense potential for this field. Despite the convenience of ChatGPT, this advanced chatbot currently has limited practical applications in psychiatry. It may be used to support psychiatrists in routine tasks such as completing medical records, facilitating communications between clinicians and with patients, polishing academic writings and presentations, and programming and performing analyses for research. The current training and application of ChatGPT require using appropriate prompts to maximize appropriate outputs and minimize deleterious inaccuracies and phantom errors. Moreover, future GPT advances that incorporate empathy, emotion recognition, personality assessment, and detection of mental health warning signs are essential for its effective integration into psychiatric care. In the near future, developing a fully-automated psychotherapy system trained for expert communication (such as psychotherapy verbatim) is conceivable by building on foundational GPT technology. This dream system should integrate practical ‘real world’ inputs and friendly AI user and patient interfaces via clinically validated algorithms, voice comprehension/generation modules, and emotion discrimination algorithms based on facial expressions and physiological inputs from wearable devices.

Data Sources and Study Setting: We leveraged 1000 medical notes randomly selected from 7401 emergency department and inpatient social worker notes generated between 2015 and 2019 for 231 unique patients diagnosed with ADRD at Michigan Medicine. Study Design: We developed a rule-based NLP algorithm for the identification of seven domains of SDoH noted above. We also compared the rule-based algorithm with deep learning and regularized logistic regression approaches. These models were compared using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). All notes were split into 700 notes for training NLP algorithms, and 300 notes for validation. Data Collection/Extraction Methods: Social worker notes used in this study were extracted from the Michigan Medicine EHR database. Principal Findings: Of the 700 notes for training, F1 and AUC for the rule-based algorithm were at least 0.94 and 0.95, respectively, for all SDoH categories. Of the 300 notes for validation, F1 and AUC were at least 0.80 and 0.97, respectively, for all SDoH except housing and medication insecurities. The deep learning and regularized logistic regression algorithms had unsatisfactory performance. Conclusions: The rule-based algorithm can accurately extract SDoH information in all seven domains of SDoH except housing and medication insecurities.

Understanding Mental Health Issues in Different Subdomains of Social Networking Services: Computational Analysis of Text-Based Reddit Posts,"Kim, S.; Cha, J.; Kim, D.; Park, E.","BACKGROUND: Users increasingly use social networking services (SNSs) to share their feelings and emotions. For those with mental disorders, SNSs can also be used to seek advice on mental health issues. One available SNS is Reddit, in which users can freely discuss such matters on relevant health diagnostic subreddits. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we analyzed the distinctive linguistic characteristics in users' posts on specific mental disorder subreddits (depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia, autism, and mental health) and further validated their distinctiveness externally by comparing them with posts of subreddits not related to mental illness. We also confirmed that these differences in linguistic formulations can be learned through a machine learning process. METHODS: Reddit posts uploaded by users were collected for our research. We used various statistical analysis methods in Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software, including 1-way ANOVA and subsequent post hoc tests, to see sentiment differences in various lexical features within mental health-related subreddits and against unrelated ones. We also applied 3 supervised and unsupervised clustering methods for both cases after extracting textual features from posts on each subreddit using bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) to ensure that our data set is suitable for further machine learning or deep learning tasks. RESULTS: We collected 3,133,509 posts of 919,722 Reddit users. The results using the data indicated that there are notable linguistic differences among the subreddits, consistent with the findings of prior research. The findings from LIWC analyses revealed that patients with each mental health issue show significantly different lexical and semantic patterns, such as word count or emotion, throughout their online social networking activities, with P<.001 for all cases. Furthermore, distinctive features of each subreddit group were successfully identified through supervised and unsupervised clustering methods, using the BERT embeddings extracted from textual posts. This distinctiveness was reflected in the Davies-Bouldin scores ranging from 0.222 to 0.397 and the silhouette scores ranging from 0.639 to 0.803 in the former case, with scores of 1.638 and 0.729, respectively, in the latter case. CONCLUSIONS: By taking a multifaceted approach, analyzing textual posts related to mental health issues using statistical, natural language processing, and machine learning techniques, our approach provides insights into aspects of recent lexical usage and information about the linguistic characteristics of patients with specific mental health issues, which can inform clinicians about patients' mental health in diagnostic terms to aid online intervention. Our findings can further promote research areas involving linguistic analysis and machine learning approaches for patients with mental health issues by identifying and detecting mentally vulnerable groups of people online. ©Seoyun Kim, Junyeop Cha, Dongjae Kim, Eunil Park.

Tracking pregnant women's mental health through social media: An analysis of reddit posts,"Dhankar, A.; Katz, A.","Objectives: Present an artificial intelligence-enabled pipeline for estimating the prevalence of depression and general anxiety among pregnant women using texts from their social media posts. Use said pipeline to analyze mental health trends on subreddits frequented by pregnant women and report on interesting insights that could be helpful for policy-makers, clinicians, etc. Materials and methods: We used pretrained transformer-based models to build a natural language processing pipeline that can automatically detect depressed pregnant women on social media and carry out topic modeling to detect their concerns. Results: We detected depressed posts by pregnant women on Reddit and validated the performance of the depression classification model by carrying out topic modeling to reveal that depressive topics were detected. The proportion of potentially depressed surprisingly reduced during the pandemic (2020 and 2021). Queries related to antidepressants, such as Zoloft, and potential ways of managing mental health dominated discourse before the pandemic (2018 and 2019), whereas queries about pelvic pain and associated stress dominated the discourse during the pandemic. Discussion and Conclusion: Supportive online communities could be a factor in alleviating stress related to the pandemic, hence the reduction in the proportion of depressed users during the pandemic. Stress during the pandemic has been associated with pelvic pain among pregnant women, and this trend is confirmed through topic modeling of depressive posts during the pandemic.  © 2023 The Author(s).

DialogueINAB: an interaction neural network based on attitudes and behaviors of interlocutors for dialogue emotion recognition,"Ding, J.; Chen, X.; Lu, P.; Yang, Z.; Li, X.; Du, Y.","Machines can be equipped with the capability of identifying human emotions through conversation, thus enabling them to empathize with natural persons when they speak to them. The emergence of chatbots and intelligent assistants has led to a heightened focus on emotion recognition tasks. Most existing methodologies primarily focus on the isolated analysis of the speaker’s attitudes and behaviors, thereby disregarding the essential interplay between the potential attitudes of interlocutors engaged in a specific conversation and their subsequent immediate dialogue behavior. As a result, the comprehension of the fundamental reasons behind the speaker’s emotional fluctuations presents a noteworthy challenge throughout the course of the dialogue. This paper utilizes the attitude behavior theory from social psychology to develop a neural network model, namely the interaction neural network behind attitudes and behaviors of interlocutors for dialogue emotion recognition (DialogueINAB), that emulates the interactive process of the interlocutor’s attitude and speech behavior in conversation. Our model presents new insights for recognizing emotions in conversations from a social psychology standpoint. DialogueINAB includes three modules: perception, information interaction, and emotion classifier. Initially, DialogueINAB identifies the features of potential attitudes and speech behaviors of the conversation interlocutors from the dialogue text. Second, by utilizing a crossmodal transformer architecture, the model can simulate the interaction between interlocutors’ potential attitude and speech behavior and produce emotional features. Finally, the emotion classifier is supplied with the generated emotion features from the model for emotion recognition in conversation. We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method through extensive experiments on three standard datasets (IEMOCAP, MELD, and AVEC). Compared with the six public baseline methods, our model improves the Weight-F1 metric by 3.56% and 1.04% on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets and reduces the MAE metric by an average of 3.3% on the AVEC dataset. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2023,,Journal of Supercomputing,79,18,20481-20514,,10.1007/s11227-023-05439-1,,#445,Ding 2023,"",""

Leveraging social media data using latent dirichlet allocation and naïve bayes for mental health sentiment analytics on Covid-19 pandemic,"Khalid, N.; Abdul-Rahman, S.; Wibowo, W.; Abdullah, N.A.S.; Mutalib, S.","In Malaysia, during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the negative impact on mental health became noticeable. The public's psychological and behavioral responses have risen as the COVID-19 outbreak progresses. A high impression of severity, vulnerability, impact, and fear was the element that influenced higher anxiety. Social media data can be used to track Malaysian sentiments in the COVID-19 era. However, it is often found on the internet in text format with no labels, and manually decoding this data is usually complicated. Furthermore, traditional data-gathering approaches, such as filling out a survey form, may not completely capture the sentiments. This study uses a text mining technique called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) on social media to discover mental health topics during the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, a model is developed using a hybrid approach, combining both lexicon-based and Naïve Bayes classifier. The accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measures are used to evaluate the sentiment classification. The result shows that the best lexicon-based technique is VADER with 72% accuracy compared to TextBlob with 70% accuracy.

Transformer models pretrained on large datasets have recently produced state of the art performance on diverse prediction tasks, but the optimal pretraining strategies for diagnostic predictions are not known. Here we report the development and external validation of Pretrained and Adapted BERT for Longitudinal Outcomes (PABLO), a transformer-based deep learning model with multitask clinical pretraining, to identify patients who will receive a diagnosis of NAT in the next year. We develop a clinical interface to visualize patient trajectories, model predictions, and individual risk factors. In two comprehensive statewide databases, approximately 1% of patients experience NAT within one year of prediction. PABLO predicts NAT events with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.844 (95% CI 0.838–0.851) in the California test set, and 0.849 (95% CI 0.846–0.851) on external validation in Florida, outperforming comparator models. Multitask pretraining significantly improves model performance. Attribution analysis shows substance use, psychiatric, and injury diagnoses, in the context of age and racial demographics, as influential predictors of NAT. As a clinical decision support system, PABLO can identify high-risk patients and patient-specific risk factors, which can be used to target secondary screening and preventive interventions at the point-of-care. © 2023, The Author(s).",2023,,npj Digital Medicine,6,1,,,10.1038/s41746-023-00875-y,,#457,Huang 2023,"",""
Towards automatic text-based estimation of depression through symptom prediction,"Milintsevich, K.; Sirts, K.; Dias, G.","Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is one of the most common and comorbid mental disorders that impacts a person’s day-to-day activity. In addition, MDD affects one’s linguistic footprint, which is reflected by subtle changes in speech production. This allows us to use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to build a neural classifier to detect depression from speech transcripts. Typically, current NLP systems discriminate only between the depressed and non-depressed states. This approach, however, disregards the complexity of the clinical picture of depression, as different people with MDD can suffer from different sets of depression symptoms. Therefore, predicting individual symptoms can provide more fine-grained information about a person’s condition. In this work, we look at the depression classification problem through the prism of the symptom network analysis approach, which shifts attention from a categorical analysis of depression towards a personalized analysis of symptom profiles. For that purpose, we trained a multi-target hierarchical regression model to predict individual depression symptoms from patient–psychiatrist interview transcripts from the DAIC-WOZ corpus. Our model achieved results on par with state-of-the-art models on both binary diagnostic classification and depression severity prediction while at the same time providing a more fine-grained overview of individual symptoms for each person. The model achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) from 0.438 to 0.830 on eight depression symptoms and showed state-of-the-art results in binary depression estimation (73.9 macro-F1) and total depression score prediction (3.78 MAE). Moreover, the model produced a symptom correlation graph that is structurally identical to the real one. The proposed symptom-based approach provides more in-depth information about the depressive condition by focusing on the individual symptoms rather than a general binary diagnosis. © 2023, The Author(s).",2023,,Brain Informatics,10,1,,,10.1186/s40708-023-00185-9,,#461,Milintsevich 2023,"",""
Bayesian network analysis of antidepressant treatment trajectories,"Turner, R.J.; Hagoort, K.; Meijer, R.J.; Coenen, F.; Scheepers, F.E.","It is currently difficult to successfully choose the correct type of antidepressant for individual patients. To discover patterns in patient characteristics, treatment choices and outcomes, we performed retrospective Bayesian network analysis combined with natural language processing (NLP). This study was conducted at two mental healthcare facilities in the Netherlands. Adult patients admitted and treated with antidepressants between 2014 and 2020 were included. Outcome measures were antidepressant continuation, prescription duration and four treatment outcome topics: core complaints, social functioning, general well-being and patient experience, extracted through NLP of clinical notes. Combined with patient and treatment characteristics, Bayesian networks were constructed at both facilities and compared. Antidepressant choices were continued in 66% and 89% of antidepressant trajectories. Score-based network analysis revealed 28 dependencies between treatment choices, patient characteristics and outcomes. Treatment outcomes and prescription duration were tightly intertwined and interacted with antipsychotics and benzodiazepine co-medication. Tricyclic antidepressant prescription and depressive disorder were important predictors for antidepressant continuation. We show a feasible way of pattern discovery in psychiatry data, through combining network analysis with NLP.

Deep learning for Arabic healthcare: MedicalBot,"Abdelhay, M.; Mohammed, A.; Hefny, H.A.","Since the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare services, particularly remote and automated healthcare consultations, have gained increased attention. Medical bots, which provide medical advice and support, are becoming increasingly popular. They offer numerous benefits, including 24/7 access to medical counseling, reduced appointment wait times by providing quick answers to common questions or concerns, and cost savings associated with fewer visits or tests required for diagnosis and treatment plans. The success of medical bots depends on the quality of their learning, which in turn depends on the appropriate corpus within the domain of interest. Arabic is one of the most commonly used languages for sharing users’ internet content. However, implementing medical bots in Arabic faces several challenges, including the language’s morphological composition, the diversity of dialects, and the need for an appropriate and large enough corpus in the medical domain. To address this gap, this paper introduces the largest Arabic Healthcare Q &A dataset, called MAQA, consisting of over 430,000 questions distributed across 20 medical specializations. Furthermore, this paper adopts three deep learning models, namely LSTM, Bi-LSTM, and Transformers, for experimenting and benchmarking the proposed corpus MAQA.

An NLP-assisted Bayesian time-series analysis for prevalence of Twitter cyberbullying during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Perez, C.; Karmakar, S.","COVID-19 has brought about many changes in social dynamics. Stay-at-home orders and disruptions in school teaching can influence bullying behavior in-person and online, both of which leading to negative outcomes in victims. To study cyberbullying specifically, 1 million tweets containing keywords associated with abuse were collected from the beginning of 2019 to the end of 2021 with the Twitter API search endpoint. A natural language processing model pre-trained on a Twitter corpus generated probabilities for the tweets being offensive and hateful. To overcome limitations of sampling, data were also collected using the count endpoint. The fraction of tweets from a given daily sample marked as abusive is multiplied to the number reported by the count endpoint. Once these adjusted counts are assembled, a Bayesian autoregressive Poisson model allows one to study the mean trend and lag functions of the data and how they vary over time.

Domestic abuse in the Covid-19 pandemic: measures designed to overcome common limitations of trend measurement,"Hodgkinson, S.; Dixon, A.; Halford, E.; Farrell, G.","Research on pandemic domestic abuse trends has produced inconsistent findings reflecting differences in definitions, data and method. This study analyses 43,488 domestic abuse crimes recorded by a UK police force. Metrics and analytic approaches are tailored to address key methodological issues in three key ways. First, it was hypothesised that reporting rates changed during lockdown, so natural language processing was used to interrogate untapped free-text information in police records to develop a novel indicator of change in reporting. Second, it was hypothesised that abuse would change differentially for those cohabiting (due to physical proximity) compared to non-cohabitees, which was assessed via a proxy measure. Third, the analytic approaches used were change-point analysis and anomaly detection: these are more independent than regression analysis for present purposes in gauging the timing and duration of significant change. However, the main findings were largely contrary to expectation: (1) domestic abuse did not increase during the first national lockdown in early 2020 but increased across a prolonged post-lockdown period, (2) the post-lockdown increase did not reflect change in reporting by victims, and; (3) the proportion of abuse between cohabiting partners, at around 40 percent of the total, did not increase significantly during or after the lockdown.

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated immense potential to adapt to novel tasks with no additional training by specifying task-specific instructions. Here we report the performance of a publicly available LLM, Flan-T5, in phenotyping patients with postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) using discharge notes from electronic health records (n = 271,081). The language model achieves strong performance in extracting 24 granular concepts associated with PPH. Identifying these granular concepts accurately allows the development of interpretable, complex phenotypes and subtypes. The Flan-T5 model achieves high fidelity in phenotyping PPH (positive predictive value of 0.95), identifying 47% more patients with this complication compared to the current standard of using claims codes. This LLM pipeline can be used reliably for subtyping PPH and outperforms a claims-based approach on the three most common PPH subtypes associated with uterine atony, abnormal placentation, and obstetric trauma. The advantage of this approach to subtyping is its interpretability, as each concept contributing to the subtype determination can be evaluated. Moreover, as definitions may change over time due to new guidelines, using granular concepts to create complex phenotypes enables prompt and efficient updating of the algorithm. Using this language modelling approach enables rapid phenotyping without the need for any manually annotated training data across multiple clinical use cases. © 2023, The Author(s).",2023,,npj Digital Medicine,6,1,,,10.1038/s41746-023-00957-x,,#479,Alsentzer 2023,"",""
Detection of the Severity Level of Depression Signs in Text Combining a Feature-Based Framework with Distributional Representations,"Muñoz, S.; Iglesias, C.Á.","Depression is a common and debilitating mental illness affecting millions of individuals, diminishing their quality of life and overall well-being. The increasing prevalence of mental health disorders has underscored the need for innovative approaches to detect and address depression. In this context, text analysis has emerged as a promising avenue. Novel solutions for text-based depression detection commonly rely on deep neural networks or transformer-based models. Although these approaches have yielded impressive results, they often come with inherent limitations, such as substantial computational requirements or a lack of interpretability. This work aims to bridge the gap between substantial performance and practicality in the detection of depression signs within digital content. To this end, we introduce a comprehensive feature framework that integrates linguistic signals, emotional expressions, and cognitive patterns. The combination of this framework with distributional representations contributes to fostering the understanding of language patterns indicative of depression and provides a deeper grasp of contextual nuances. We exploit this combination using traditional machine learning methods in an effort to yield substantial performance without compromising interpretability and computational efficiency. The performance and generalizability of our approach have been assessed through experimentation using multiple publicly available English datasets. The results demonstrate that our method yields throughput on par with more complex and resource-intensive solutions, achieving F1-scores above 70%. This accomplishment is notable, as the proposed method simultaneously preserves the virtues of simplicity, interpretability, and reduced computational overhead. In summary, the findings of this research contribute to the field by offering an accessible and scalable solution for the detection of depression in real-world scenarios. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),13,21,,,10.3390/app132111695,,#480,Muñoz 2023,"",""

Initial development of tools to identify child abuse and neglect in pediatric primary care,"Hanson, R.F.; Zhu, V.; Are, F.; Espeleta, H.; Wallis, E.; Heider, P.; Kautz, M.; Lenert, L.","Background: Child abuse and neglect (CAN) is prevalent, associated with long-term adversities, and often undetected. Primary care settings offer a unique opportunity to identify CAN and facilitate referrals, when warranted. Electronic health records (EHR) contain extensive information to support healthcare decisions, yet time constraints preclude most providers from thorough EHR reviews that could indicate CAN. Strategies that summarize EHR data to identify CAN and convey this to providers has potential to mitigate CAN-related sequelae. This study used expert review/consensus and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to develop and test a lexicon to characterize children who have experienced or are at risk for CAN and compared machine learning methods to the lexicon + NLP approach to determine the algorithm’s performance for identifying CAN. Methods: Study investigators identified 90 CAN terms and invited an interdisciplinary group of child abuse experts for review and validation. We then used NLP to develop pipelines to finalize the CAN lexicon. Data for pipeline development and refinement were drawn from a randomly selected sample of EHR from patients seen at pediatric primary care clinics within a U.S. academic health center. To explore a machine learning approach for CAN identification, we used Support Vector Machine algorithms. Results: The investigator-generated list of 90 CAN terms were reviewed and validated by 25 invited experts, resulting in a final pool of 133 terms. NLP utilized a randomly selected sample of 14,393 clinical notes from 153 patients to test the lexicon, and.03% of notes were identified as CAN positive. CAN identification varied by clinical note type, with few differences found by provider type (physicians versus nurses, social workers, etc.). An evaluation of the final NLP pipelines indicated 93.8% positive CAN rate for the training set and 71.4% for the test set, with decreased precision attributed primarily to false positives. For the machine learning approach, SVM pipeline performance was 92% for CAN + and 100% for non-CAN, indicating higher sensitivity than specificity. Conclusions: The NLP algorithm’s development and refinement suggest that innovative tools can identify youth at risk for CAN. The next key step is to refine the NLP algorithm to eventually funnel this information to care providers to guide clinical decision making. © 2023, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.",2023,,BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making,23,1,,,10.1186/s12911-023-02361-7,,#487,Hanson 2023,"",""

However, existing studies have been limited, with the target diseases including only major diseases, small sample sizes, or no comparison with diagnoses made by psychiatrists to ensure accuracy. Therefore, we formulated an accurate diagnostic model that covers all psychiatric disorders. Methods: HPIs and diagnoses were extracted from discharge summaries of 2,642 cases at the Nara Medical University Hospital, Japan, from 21 May 2007, to 31 May 31 2021. The diagnoses were classified into 11 classes according to the code from ICD-10 Chapter V. Using UTH-BERT pre-trained on the electronic medical records of the University of Tokyo Hospital, Japan, we predicted the main diagnoses at discharge based on HPIs and compared the concordance rate with the results of psychiatrists. The psychiatrists were divided into two groups: semi-Designated with 3–4 years of experience and Residents with only 2 months of experience. Results: The model's match rate was 74.3%, compared to 71.5% for the semi-Designated psychiatrists and 69.4% for the Residents. If the cases were limited to those correctly answered by the semi-Designated group, the model and the Residents performed at 84.9% and 83.3%, respectively.

To overcome limitations with national data, we applied novel methods to: (1) document the prevalence of IPV-related suicide in the USA and (2) identify correlates for IPV-related suicide. Methods Using National Violent Death Reporting System data (NVDRS, 2015-2019, n=1 30 550), we recorded IPV circumstances (yes/no) by leveraging prior textual reviews of death narratives and applying a validated natural language processing tool. We could not systematically differentiate IPV perpetration versus victimisation given limited details in NVDRS. Logistic regression compared IPV-related suicides with referent group suicides (no evidence of IPV), stratified by sex. Results 7.1% of suicides were IPV related (n=9210), most were isolated suicide events (82.8%, n=7625; ie, not homicide suicide). There were higher odds of IPV circumstances when the decedent had civil legal problems (aOR for men: 3.6 (3.3 to 3.9), aOR for women: 2.6 (2.2 to 3.2)), criminal legal problems (aOR men: 2.3 (2.2 to 2.5), aOR for women: 1.7 (1.4 to 2.1)), or used a firearm (aOR men: 1.9 (1.8 to 2.0), aOR for women: 1.9 (1.7 to 2.1)).

On the use of aspect-based sentiment analysis of Twitter data to explore the experiences of African Americans during COVID-19,"Chaudhary, M.; Kosyluk, K.; Thomas, S.; Neal, T.","According to data from the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention, as of June 2020, a significant number of African Americans had been infected with the coronavirus disease, experiencing disproportionately higher death rates compared to other demographic groups. These disparities highlight the urgent need to examine the experiences, behaviors, and opinions of the African American population in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. By understanding their unique challenges in navigating matters of health and well-being, we can work towards promoting health equity, eliminating disparities, and addressing persistent barriers to care. Since Twitter data has shown significant promise as a representation of human behavior and for opinion mining, this study leverages Twitter data published in 2020 to characterize the pandemic-related experiences of the United States’ African American population using aspect-based sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis is a common task in natural language processing that identifies the emotional tone (i.e., positive, negative, or neutral) of a text sample. Aspect-based sentiment analysis increases the granularity of sentiment analysis by also extracting the aspect for which sentiment is expressed. We developed a machine learning pipeline consisting of image and language-based classification models to filter out tweets not related to COVID-19 and those unlikely published by African American Twitter subscribers, leading to an analysis of nearly 4 million tweets. Overall, our results show that the majority of tweets had a negative tone, and that the days with larger numbers of published tweets often coincided with major U.S. events related to the pandemic as suggested by major news headlines (e.g., vaccine rollout). We also show how word usage evolved throughout the year (e.g., outbreak to pandemic and coronavirus to covid). This work also points to important issues like food insecurity and vaccine hesitation, along with exposing semantic relationships between words, such as covid and exhausted.

This article presents the ArPanEmo dataset, a novel dataset for fine-grained emotion recognition of online posts in Arabic. The dataset comprises 11,128 online posts manually labeled for ten emotion categories or neutral, with Fleiss' kappa of 0.71. It is unique in that it focuses on the Saudi dialect and addresses topics related to the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the first and largest of its kind. Python's packages were utilized to collect online posts related to the COVID-19 pandemic from three sources: Twitter, YouTube, and online newspaper comments between March 2020 and March 2022. Upon collection of the online posts, each one underwent a semi-automatic classification process using a lexicon of emotion-related terms to determine whether it belonged to the neutral or emotion category. Subsequently, manual labeling was conducted to further categorize the emotional data into fine-grained emotion categories. We anticipate that the ArPanEmo dataset will enrich Arabic NLP resources and help in the development of machine learning and deep learning tools to identify emotions in a given text. It will also contribute to developing systems that monitor online suspicious behaviors or mental health disorders. The final dataset is formatted in CSV, consisting of three columns: the number of the post, the post's text, and the corresponding emotion label. This format facilitates incorporating and utilizing the dataset in any machine learning research. © 2023 The Author(s)",2023,,Data in Brief,51,,,,10.1016/j.dib.2023.109745,,#500,Althobaiti 2023,"",""
Women in Need—The Nature of Social Support in an Online Community,"Erčulj, V.I.; Pavšič Mrevlje, T.","Some women, especially victims of violence, seek support in online groups. The objective of this research was to investigate the nature of the social support women receive in such online communities. For this purpose, all the posts from a large online support community group for women in Slovenia, Women in Need, from 2002 to the end of 2020 were retrieved and analyzed manually as well as by using a text-mining approach. The results show that women in the investigated community mostly seek informational support, spend little time actively contributing to online discussions, and rarely become engaged members of supportive groups within the focal online space.

Mind meets machine: Unravelling GPT-4’s cognitive psychology,"Dhingra, S.; Singh, M.; S.B., V.; Malviya, N.; Gill, S.S.","Cognitive psychology delves on understanding perception, attention, memory, language, problem-solving, decision-making, and reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as potent tools increasingly capable of performing human-level tasks. The recent development in the form of Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) and its demonstrated success in tasks complex to humans exam and complex problems has led to an increased confidence in the LLMs to become perfect instruments of intelligence. Although GPT-4 report has shown performance on some cognitive psychology tasks, a comprehensive assessment of GPT-4, via the existing well-established datasets is required. In this study, we focus on the evaluation of GPT-4’s performance on a set of cognitive psychology datasets such as CommonsenseQA, SuperGLUE, MATH and HANS. In doing so, we understand how GPT-4 processes and integrates cognitive psychology with contextual information, providing insight into the underlying cognitive processes that enable its ability to generate the responses. We show that GPT-4 exhibits a high level of accuracy in cognitive psychology tasks relative to the prior state-of-the-art models. Our results strengthen the already available assessments and confidence on GPT-4’s cognitive psychology abilities.

Reasons for Discontinuation or Change of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors in Online Drug Reviews,"Golder, S.; Medaglio, D.; O'Connor, K.; Hennessy, S.; Gross, R.; Gonzalez Hernandez, G.","Importance: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a commonly prescribed medication class to treat a variety of mental disorders. However, adherence to SSRIs is low, and uncovering the reasons for discontinuation among SSRI users is an important first step to improving medication persistence. Objective: To identify the reasons SSRIs are discontinued or changed, as reported by patients and caregivers in online drug reviews. Design, Setting, and Participants: This qualitative study used natural language processing and machine learning to extract mentions of changes in SSRI intake from 667 drug reviews posted on the online health forum WebMD from September 1, 2007, to August 31, 2021. The type of medication change, including discontinuation, switch to another medication, or dose change and the reason for the change were manually annotated. In each instance in which an adverse event was reported, the event was categorized using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities primary system organ class (SOC) codes, and its relative frequency was compared with that in spontaneous reporting systems maintained by the US Food and Drug Administration and the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. Main Outcomes and Measures: Reasons for SSRI medication change as assessed using SOC codes. Results: In total, 667 reviews posted by 659 patients or caregivers (516 [78%] of patients were female; 410 [62%] 25-54 years of age) were identified that indicated a medication change: 335 posts indicated SSRI discontinuation, 188 posts indicated dose change, and 179 posts indicated switched medications. Most authors 625 (95%) were patients. The most common reason for medication discontinuation or switching was adverse events experienced, and the most common reason for dose change was titration. Both uptitration and downtitration were initiated by either a health care professional or patient. The most common adverse events were classified by SOC codes as psychiatric disorders, including insomnia, loss of libido, and anxiety. Compared with those in regulatory data, psychiatric adverse events, adverse events recorded by investigations (mostly weight gain) and adverse events associated with the reproductive system (mostly erectile dysfunction) were reported disproportionately more often. Conclusions and Relevance: This qualitative study of online drug reviews found that useful information was provided directly by patients or their caregivers regarding their medication behavior, specifically, information regarding SSRI treatment changes that may inform interventions to improve adherence. These findings suggest that these reported adverse events may be associated with SSRI persistence and that people may feel more inclined to report such events on social media than to clinicians or regulatory agencies.",2023,,JAMA network open,6,7,e2323746,,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.23746,,#504,Golder 2023,"",""
ReDDIT: Regret detection and domain identification from text,"Balouchzahi, F.; Butt, S.; Sidorov, G.; Gelbukh, A.","Regret is a universal emotion that arises from sadness, disappointment, or remorse about something that has occurred or that one has done or failed to do in the past. It typically involves wishing that a different decision had been made or that a different action had been taken. Although regret has been studied in various contexts such as psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy, its expression and analysis on social media using natural language processing techniques is a relatively recent research topic that warrants further investigation. In this paper, we present a study of regret and its expression on social media platforms. Specifically, we present a novel dataset of Reddit texts that have been classified into three classes: Regret by Action, Regret by Inaction, and No Regret. We then use this dataset to investigate the language used to express regret on Reddit and to identify the domains of text that are most commonly associated with regret. Our findings show that Reddit users are most likely to express regret for past actions, particularly in the domain of relationships. We also found that deep learning models using GloVe embedding outperformed other models in all experiments, indicating the effectiveness of GloVe for representing the meaning and context of words in the domain of regret. Overall, our study provides valuable insights into the nature and prevalence of regret on social media, as well as the potential of deep learning and word embeddings for analyzing and understanding emotional language in online text. These findings have implications for the development of natural language processing algorithms and the design of social media platforms that support emotional expression and communication. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2023,,Expert Systems with Applications,225,,,,10.1016/j.eswa.2023.120099,,#507,Balouchzahi 2023,"",""

The impact of depression forums on illness narratives: a comprehensive NLP analysis of socialization in e-mental health communities,"Sik, D.; Rakovics, M.; Buda, J.; Németh, R.","While depression is globally on the rise, the mental health sector struggles with handling the increased number of cases, especially since the pandemic. These circumstances have resulted in an increased interest in the e-mental health sector. The dataset is constituted of 67 857 posts from the most popular English-language online health forums between 15 February 2016 and 15 February 2019. The posts were first automatically labelled (biomedical vs. psy framing) via deep learning; second, the time series of framing types of recurring forum users were analysed; third, the clusters of biomedical and psy patterns were analysed; fourth, the discursive characteristics of each cluster were analysed with the help of topic modelling. Five ideal-typical patterns of forum socialization are described: the first and the second clusters express the developing of a ‘recovery helper’ role, either by opposing expert discourses or by identifying with the psy discourses; the third cluster expresses the acquiring of a substantively diffuse, uncertain role; the fourth and fifth clusters refer to a trajectory leading to the incorporating of a biomedically framed patient role, or a therapeutic psy subjectivity. Elements of data collection that potentially undermine representativeness: online forum users, open and public forums, keyword search.

Methodology of Labeling According to 9 Criteria of DSM-5,"Lee, G.; Park, D.; Oh, H.","Depression disorder is a disease that causes a deterioration of daily function and can induce thoughts of suicide. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-5), which is the official reference of the American Psychiatry Association and is also used in Korea to identify depressive disorders, sets nine criteria for diagnosing depressive disorders. The lack of counseling personnel, including psychiatrists, and negative social perceptions of depressive disorders prevent counselors from being treated for depressive disorders. Natural language processing-based artificial intelligence (AI) services such as chatbots can help fill this need, but labeled datasets are needed to train AI services.

Methods This was a retrospective study of ED visits from 2013–2020 across ten sites within a regional healthcare network. We derived phenotypes from visits for patients >18 years of age with at least one prior or current documentation of an opioid-related diagnosis. Natural language processing was used to extract clinical entities from notes, which were combined with structured data within the EHR to create a set of features. We performed latent dirichlet allocation to identify topics within these features. Groups of patient presentations with similar attributes were identified by cluster analysis. Results In total 82,577 ED visits met inclusion criteria. The 30 topics were discovered ranging from those related to substance use disorder, chronic conditions, mental health, and medical management. Clustering on these topics identified nine unique cohorts with one-year survivals ranging from 84.2–96.8%, rates of one-year ED returns from 9–34%, rates of one-year opioid event 10–17%, rates of medications for opioid use disorder from 17–43%, and a median Carlson comorbidity index of 2–8. Two cohorts of phenotypes were identified related to chronic substance use disorder, or acute overdose. Conclusions Our results indicate distinct phenotypic clusters with varying patient-oriented outcomes which provide future targets better allocation of resources and therapeutics.

Comparing the Discussion of Telehealth in Two Social Media Platforms: Social Listening Analysis,"Shoults, C.C.; Dawson, L.; Hayes, C.; Eswaran, H.","Background: Social media is used as a source of information and platform to discuss health care; however, there is little research on discussion of telehealth in social media. Past research has looked at individual platforms, but a comparison of discussion on two platforms (Reddit and Twitter) has not been performed. Understanding telehealth-related social media discourse and the differences between platforms may provide insights into how telehealth is characterized online and which platforms provide patient perspectives. The COVID-19 pandemic provides a unique case study to examine how social media users approached both Reddit and Twitter during an international health crisis. This study used natural language processing tools and two social media platforms to (1) characterize and contrast each platform's telehealth-related posts according to themes and (2) assess the frequency of telehealth and telehealth-related terms posts before and during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We collected 6 years (2016 through 2021) of social media posts from Twitter and Reddit. The themes of the corpus were extracted using hashtags, subreddits, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: Both Twitter and Reddit showed exponential growth in the use of the term ""telehealth""and telehealth-related terms in early 2020. The use of telehealth-related terms and discussion of COVID-19 coincided in both social media sites; however, other themes were discussed, including how to use telehealth. Reddit LDA clusters showed greatest usage of ""telehealth""when associated with using or suggesting telehealth for receiving therapy, counseling, or psychoanalysis while Twitter focused on sharing telehealth news, products, and services. Discussion: Twitter and Reddit had extensive growth in the use of telehealth-related terms after the COVID-19 pandemic. Twitter and Reddit showed themes connecting COVID-19 to telehealth, especially in reference to services, therapy, and counseling, however, Reddit had more discussion suggesting use of telehealth services or requesting peer insights into how to use telehealth as compared with Twitter, which appeared more focused on telehealth as a business or product.  © Catherine C.

Hybrid Feature Extraction for Multi-Label Emotion Classification in English Text Messages,"Ahanin, Z.; Ismail, M.A.; Singh, N.S.S.; AL-Ashmori, A.","Emotions are vital for identifying an individual’s attitude and mental condition. Detecting and classifying emotions in Natural Language Processing applications can improve Human–Computer Interaction systems, leading to effective decision making in organizations. Several studies on emotion classification have employed word embedding as a feature extraction method, but they do not consider the sentiment polarity of words. Moreover, relying exclusively on deep learning models to extract linguistic features may result in misclassifications due to the small training dataset. In this paper, we present a hybrid feature extraction model using human-engineered features combined with deep learning based features for emotion classification in English text. The proposed model uses data augmentation, captures contextual information, integrates knowledge from lexical resources, and employs deep learning models, including Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) and Bidirectional Encoder Representation and Transformer (BERT), to address the issues mentioned above. The proposed model with hybrid features attained the highest Jaccard accuracy on two of the benchmark datasets, with 68.40% on SemEval-2018 and 53.45% on the GoEmotions dataset. The results show the significance of the proposed technique, and we can conclude that the incorporation of the hybrid features improves the performance of the baseline models. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,,Sustainability (Switzerland),15,16,,,10.3390/su151612539,,#532,Ahanin 2023,"",""
An NLP approach to identify SDoH-related circumstance and suicide crisis from death investigation narratives,"Wang, S.; Dang, Y.; Sun, Z.; Ding, Y.; Pathak, J.; Tao, C.; Xiao, Y.; Peng, Y.","OBJECTIVES: Suicide presents a major public health challenge worldwide, affecting people across the lifespan. While previous studies revealed strong associations between Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) and suicide deaths, existing evidence is limited by the reliance on structured data. To resolve this, we aim to adapt a suicide-specific SDoH ontology (Suicide-SDoHO) and use natural language processing (NLP) to effectively identify individual-level SDoH-related social risks from death investigation narratives. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the latest National Violent Death Report System (NVDRS), which contains 267 804 victim suicide data from 2003 to 2019. After adapting the Suicide-SDoHO, we developed a transformer-based model to identify SDoH-related circumstances and crises in death investigation narratives. We applied our model retrospectively to annotate narratives whose crisis variables were not coded in NVDRS. The crisis rates were calculated as the percentage of the group's total suicide population with the crisis present. RESULTS: The Suicide-SDoHO contains 57 fine-grained circumstances in a hierarchical structure. Our classifier achieves AUCs of 0.966 and 0.942 for classifying circumstances and crises, respectively. Through the crisis trend analysis, we observed that not everyone is equally affected by SDoH-related social risks. For the economic stability crisis, our result showed a significant increase in crisis rate in 2007-2009, parallel with the Great Recession. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study curating a Suicide-SDoHO using death investigation narratives. We showcased that our model can effectively classify SDoH-related social risks through NLP approaches. We hope our study will facilitate the understanding of suicide crises and inform effective prevention strategies. © The Author(s) 2023.

Unraveling ethnic disparities in antipsychotic prescribing among patients with psychosis: A retrospective cohort study based on electronic clinical records,"Wang, T.; Codling, D.; Bhugra, D.; Msosa, Y.; Broadbent, M.; Patel, R.; Roberts, A.; McGuire, P.; Stewart, R.; Dobson, R.; Harland, R.","Background: Previous studies have shown mixed evidence on ethnic disparities in antipsychotic prescribing among patients with psychosis in the UK, partly due to small sample sizes. This study aimed to examine the current state of antipsychotic prescription with respect to patient ethnicity among the entire population known to a large UK mental health trust with non-affective psychosis, adjusting for multiple potential risk factors. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included all patients (N = 19,291) who were aged 18 years or over at their first diagnoses of non-affective psychosis (identified with the ICD-10 codes of F20–F29) recorded in electronic health records (EHRs) at the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust until March 2021. The most recently recorded antipsychotic treatments and patient attributes were extracted from EHRs, including both structured fields and free-text fields processed using natural language processing applications. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to calculate the odds ratios (OR) for antipsychotic prescription according to patient ethnicity, adjusted for multiple potential contributing factors, including demographic (age and gender), clinical (diagnoses, duration of illness, service use and history of cannabis use), socioeconomic factors (level of deprivation and own-group ethnic density in the area of residence) and temporal changes in clinical guidelines (date of prescription). Results: The cohort consisted of 43.10 % White, 8.31 % Asian, 40.80 % Black, 2.64 % Mixed, and 5.14 % of patients from Other ethnicity. Among them, 92.62 % had recorded antipsychotic receipt, where 24.05 % for depot antipsychotics and 81.72 % for second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) medications. Most ethnic minority groups were not significantly different from White patients in receiving any antipsychotic. Among those receiving antipsychotic prescribing, Black patients were more likely to be prescribed depot (adjusted OR 1.29, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.14–1.47), but less likely to receive SGA (adjusted OR 0.85, 95 % CI 0.74–0.97), olanzapine (OR 0.82, 95 % CI 0.73–0.92) and clozapine (adjusted OR 0.71, 95 % CI 0.6–0.85) than White patients. All the ethnic minority groups were less likely to be prescribed olanzapine than the White group. Conclusions: Black patients with psychosis had a distinct pattern in antipsychotic prescription, with less use of SGA, including olanzapine and clozapine, but more use of depot antipsychotics, even when adjusting for the effects of multiple demographic, clinical and socioeconomic factors.

User Feedback on the Use of a Natural Language Processing Application to Screen for Suicide Risk in the Emergency Department,"Pease, J.L.; Thompson, D.; Wright-Berryman, J.; Campbell, M.","Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the USA and globally. Despite decades of research, the ability to predict who will die by suicide is still no better than 50%.

Quantitative and qualitative analysis of individual experiences post botulinum toxin injection - United Kingdom Survey,"Zargaran, D.; Zargaran, A.; Sousi, S.; Knight, D.; Cook, H.; Woollard, A.; Davies, J.; Weyrich, T.; Mosahebi, A.","Introduction: In the United Kingdom (UK), complications that arise following the administration of Botulinum Toxin are reported to the Medicines and Health Regulatory Agency (MHRA) via the Yellow Card Reporting Scheme. Over the past decade, there has been a significant increase in the number of non-surgical aesthetic procedures. Concerns have been raised that the MHRA is not fully capturing complications in terms of volume and impact on patients. Aim: This novel study explores the lived experiences of individuals who have experienced an adverse event following administration of Botulinum Toxin for aesthetic purposes. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methodologies, this analysis evaluates data relating to long-lasting physical, psychological, emotional, and financial sequelae of complications arising from cosmetic Botulinum Toxin injections in the UK. Methods: A mixed method, qualitative and quantitative approach was adopted to gain comprehensive insights into patients' experiences. A focus group which comprised patient representatives, psychologists, and researchers reached a consensus on a 17-question survey which was disseminated via social media channels. Deductive thematic analysis was used to analyse coded themes. Furthermore, for secondary analysis, sentiment analysis was used computationally as an innovative approach to identify and categorise free text responses associated with sentiments using natural language processing (NLP). Results: In the study, 655 responses were received, with 287 (44%) of respondents completing all questions. The mean age of respondents was 42.6 years old. 94.1% of respondents identified as female. In the sample, 79% of respondents reported an adverse event following their procedure, with the most common event being reported as ‘anxiety’. Findings revealed that 69% of respondents reported long-lasting adverse effects. From the responses, 68.4% reported not having recovered physically, 63.5% of respondents stated that they had not recovered emotionally from complications, and 61.7% said that they have not recovered psychologically. In addition, 84% of respondents stated that they do not know who regulates the aesthetics industry. Furthermore, 92% of participants reported that their clinic or practitioner did not inform them about the Yellow Card Reporting Scheme. The sentiment analysis using the AFINN Lexicon yielded adjusted scores ranging from −3 to +2, with a mean value of −1.58. Conclusion: This is the largest survey in the UK completed by patients who experienced an adverse outcome following the aesthetic administration of Botulinum Toxin. Our study highlights the extent of the challenges faced by patients who experience an adverse event from physical, emotional, psychological, and financial perspectives. The lack of awareness of MHRA reporting structures and the lack of regulation within the UK's cosmetic injectables sector represent a significant public health challenge. © 2023 The Authors.

The investigation on transformer-based model for multi-class causal categorization in Reddit posts point to a problem of using long-text which contains as many as 4000 words. Developing end-to-end transformer-based models subject to the limitation of maximum-length in a given instance. To handle this problem, we use Longformer and deploy its encoding on transformer-based classifier. The experimental results show that Longformer achieves new state-of-the-art results on M-CAMS, a publicly available dataset with 62% F1-score. Cause-specific analysis and ablation study prove the effectiveness of Longformer. We believe our work facilitates causal analysis of depression and suicide risk on social media data, and shows potential for application on other mental health conditions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",2023,,Knowledge-Based Systems,276,,,,10.1016/j.knosys.2023.110742,,#551,Garg 2023,"",""
A deep learning approach to text-based personality prediction using multiple data sources mapping,"Sirasapalli, J.J.; Malla, R.M.","Automated personality traits prediction from widely available social media text data, is finding its increased applications in recommender systems, psychology, forecasting, and decision making. The aim of this research is to break the digital text data into features, analyse and map it to an appropriate personality model. Because of its simplicity and shown competence, a well-known personality model known as the Big Five personality characteristics has frequently been welcomed in the literature as the norm for personality evaluation. Recent advances in automated personality detection have focused on including sentiments, emotions, linguistic styles, and other natural language processing techniques. All these approaches are proposed by a fact concerned with the limited amount of data available for processing by deep learning algorithms. Personality datasets with conventional personality labels are few, and collecting them is challenging due to privacy concerns, as well as the high expense of hiring expert psychologists to label them. The performance of the model can even be increased if a large amount of labelled data is available. This research proposes a new personality prediction model using data source mapping and data fusion techniques. The results are evident that the proposed methodology has outperformed the existing methodologies. To be more precise, the results had the highest accuracy of 87.89% and 0.924 F1 measure score after mapping MBTI into Big Five personality traits and later, fusion with Essays and myPersonality datasets. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",2023,,Neural Computing and Applications,35,28,20619-20630,,10.1007/s00521-023-08846-w,,#555,Sirasapalli 2023,"",""
A multisite comparison using electronic health records and natural language processing to identify the association between suicidality and hospital readmission amongst patients with eating disorders,"Cliffe, C.; Cusick, M.; Vellupillai, S.; Shear, M.; Downs, J.; Epstein, S.; Pathak, J.; Dutta, R.","Objectives: To describe and compare the association between suicidality and subsequent readmission for patients hospitalized for eating disorder treatment, within 2 years of discharge, at two large academic medical centers in two different countries. Methods: Over an 8-year study window from January 2009 to March 2017, we identified all inpatient eating disorder admissions at Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, USA (WCM) and South London and Maudsley Foundation NHS Trust, London, UK (SLaM). To establish each patient's—suicidality profile, we applied two natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, independently developed at the two institutions, and detected suicidality in clinical notes documented in the first week of admission. We calculated the odds ratios (OR) for any subsequent readmission within 2 years postdischarge and determined whether this was to another eating disorder unit, other psychiatric unit, a general medical hospital admission or emergency room attendance. Results: We identified 1126 and 420 eating disorder inpatient admissions at WCM and SLaM, respectively. In the WCM cohort, evidence of above average suicidality during the first week of admission was significantly associated with an increased risk of noneating disorder-related psychiatric readmission (OR 3.48 95% CI = 2.03–5.99, p-value <.001), but a similar pattern was not observed in the SLaM cohort (OR 1.34, 95% CI = 0.75–2.37, p =.32), there was no significant increase in risk of admission. In both cohorts, personality disorder increased the risk of any psychiatric readmission within 2 years. Discussion: Patterns of increased risk of psychiatric readmission from above average suicidality detected via NLP during inpatient eating disorder admissions differed in our two patient cohorts. However, comorbid diagnoses such as personality disorder increased the risk of any psychiatric readmission across both cohorts. Public Significance: Suicidality amongst is eating disorders is an extremely common presentation and it is important we further our understanding of identifying those most at risk. This research also provides a novel study design, comparing two NLP algorithms on electronic health record data based in the United States and United Kingdom on eating disorder inpatients.

Fell on Black Days: Analyzing the Song Lyrics of Chris Cornell for Insight into Depression and Suicide,"Conway, K.P.; McGrain, P.; Theodory, M.","Chris Cornell was a guitarist, singer, songwriter, and pioneer of grunge music. Cornell struggled with mental illness and addiction and incorporated these themes into his song lyrics. At age 52, Cornell died by suicide in his hotel bathroom following a live performance. This mixed-methods study examines Cornell’s song lyrics for references to negative words and themes related to depression and suicide. Two coders independently reviewed lyrical transcripts to identify the primary theme, secondary theme(s), and valence (positive or negative). Sentiment analysis, a natural language processing technique, was used to examine word frequency and valence. Songs (N = 215) were predominantly (79%) negative and contained more negative (N = 3244, 56.1%) than positive (N = 2537, 43.9%) words. Thematic analysis by stage of career shows a narrowing focus on depression, failed relationships, and morbid thoughts. Themes of depressed mood, death, and suicide were common and increased by stage of career. By applying qualitative and quantitative techniques to song lyrics, this study revealed that Cornell’s songs reflect a narrative of negativity consistent with someone experiencing depression and thoughts of death and suicide. Like personal notes and poems, song lyrics may reflect symptoms of depression and suicidal thoughts warranting clinical attention. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,20,16,,,10.3390/ijerph20166621,,#563,Conway 2023,"",""
Characteristics of Intimate Partner Violence and Survivor’s Needs During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Insights From Subreddits Related to Intimate Partner Violence,"Kim, S.; Warren, E.; Jahangir, T.; Al-Garadi, M.; Guo, Y.; Yang, Y.-C.; Lakamana, S.; Sarker, A.","Intimate partner violence (IPV) increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Collecting actionable IPV-related data from conventional sources (e.g., medical records) was challenging during the pandemic, generating a need to obtain relevant data from non-conventional sources, such as social media. Social media, like Reddit, is a preferred medium of communication for IPV survivors to share their experiences and seek support with protected anonymity. Nevertheless, the scope of available IPV-related data on social media is rarely documented. Thus, we examined the availability of IPV-related information on Reddit and the characteristics of the reported IPV during the pandemic. Using natural language processing, we collected publicly available Reddit data from four IPV-related subreddits between January 1, 2020 and March 31, 2021. Of 4,000 collected posts, we randomly sampled 300 posts for analysis. Three individuals on the research team independently coded the data and resolved the coding discrepancies through discussions. We adopted quantitative content analysis and calculated the frequency of the identified codes. 36% of the posts (n = 108) constituted self-reported IPV by survivors, of which 40% regarded current/ongoing IPV, and 14% contained help-seeking messages. A majority of the survivors’ posts reflected psychological aggression, followed by physical violence. Notably, 61.4% of the psychological aggression involved expressive aggression, followed by gaslighting (54.3%) and coercive control (44.3%). Survivors’ top three needs during the pandemic were hearing similar experiences, legal advice, and validating their feelings/reactions/thoughts/actions. Albeit limited, data from bystanders (survivors’ friends, family, or neighbors) were also available. Rich data reflecting IPV survivors’ lived experiences were available on Reddit. Such information will be useful for IPV surveillance, prevention, and intervention. © The Author(s) 2023.",2023,,Journal of Interpersonal Violence,38,17-18,9693-9716,,10.1177/08862605231168816,,#566,Kim 2023,"",""
A Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Techniques for Cyberbullying Detection on FormSpring in Textual Modality,"Sahana, V.; Anil Kumar, K.M.; Darem, A.A.","Social media usage has increased tremendously with the rise of the internet and it has evolved into the most powerful networking platform of the twenty-first century. However, a number of undesirable phenomena are associated with increased use of social networking, such as cyberbullying (CB), cybercrime, online abuse and online trolling. Especially for children and women, cyberbullying can have severe psychological and physical effects, even leading to self-harm or suicide. Because of its significant detrimental social impact, the detection of CB text or messages on social media has attracted more research work. To mitigate CB, we have proposed an automated cyberbullying detection model that detects and classifies cyberbullying content as either bullying or non-bullying (binary classification model), creating a more secure social media experience. The proposed model uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning (ML) approaches to assess cyberbullying contents. Our main goal is to assess different machine learning algorithms for their performance in cyberbullying detection based on a labelled dataset from Formspring [1]. Nine popular machine learning classifiers namely Bootstrap Aggregation or Bagging, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), Linear Support Vector Classifier (Linear SVC), Logistic Regression (LR), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) are considered for the work. In addition, we have experimented with a feature extraction method namely CountVectorizer to obtain features that aid for better classification. The results show that the classification accuracy of AdaBoost classifier is 86.52% which is found better than all other machine learning algorithms used in this study. The proposed work demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in automatic cyberbullying detection as against the very intense and time-consuming approaches for the same problem, thereby by facilitating easy incorporation of an effective approach as tools across different platforms enabling people to use social media safely. © 2023, Modern Education and Computer Science Press.

Expanding the methodological toolbox: Machine-based item desirability ratings as an alternative to human-based ratings,"Hommel, B.E.","The accuracy of self-reported data in the social and behavioral sciences may be compromised by response biases such as socially desirable responding. Researchers and scale developers therefore obtain item desirability ratings, in order to maintain item neutrality, and parity with alternative options when creating forced-choice items. Gathering item desirability ratings from human judges can be time-consuming and costly, with no consistent guidelines with regard to required sample size and composition. However, recent advancements in natural language processing have yielded large language models (LLMs) with exceptional abilities to identify abstract semantic attributes in text. The presented research highlights the potential application of LLMs to estimate the desirability of items, as evidenced by the re-analysis of data from 14 distinct studies. Findings indicate a significant and strong correlation between human- and machine-rated item desirability of .80, across 521 items. Results furthermore showed that the proposed fine-tuning approach of LLMs results in predictions that explained 19 % more variance beyond that of sentiment analysis. These results demonstrate the feasibility of relying on machine-based item desirability ratings as a viable alternative to human-based ratings and contribute to the field of personality psychology by expanding the methodological toolbox available to researchers, scale developers, and practitioners. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2023,,Personality and Individual Differences,213,,,,10.1016/j.paid.2023.112307,,#568,Hommel 2023,"",""
Natural Language Processing of Learners’ Evaluations of Attendings to Identify Professionalism Lapses,"Heath, J.K.; Clancy, C.B.; Pluta, W.; Weissman, G.E.; Anderson, U.; Kogan, J.R.; Dine, C.J.; Shea, J.A.","Unprofessional faculty behaviors negatively impact the well-being of trainees yet are infrequently reported through established reporting systems. Manual review of narrative faculty evaluations provides an additional avenue for identifying unprofessional behavior but is time- and resource-intensive, and therefore of limited value for identifying and remediating faculty with professionalism concerns. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques may provide a mechanism for streamlining manual review processes to identify faculty professionalism lapses. In this retrospective cohort study of 15,432 narrative evaluations of medical faculty by medical trainees, we identified professionalism lapses using automated analysis of the text of faculty evaluations. We used multiple NLP approaches to develop and validate several classification models, which were evaluated primarily based on the positive predictive value (PPV) and secondarily by their calibration. A NLP-model using sentiment analysis (quantifying subjectivity of the text) in combination with key words (using the ensemble technique) had the best performance overall with a PPV of 49% (CI 38%-59%).

Automatic extraction of social determinants of health from medical notes of chronic lower back pain patients,"Lituiev, D.S.; Lacar, B.; Pak, S.; Abramowitsch, P.L.; De Marchis, E.H.; Peterson, T.A.","OBJECTIVE: We applied natural language processing and inference methods to extract social determinants of health (SDoH) information from clinical notes of patients with chronic low back pain (cLBP) to enhance future analyses of the associations between SDoH disparities and cLBP outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical notes for patients with cLBP were annotated for 7 SDoH domains, as well as depression, anxiety, and pain scores, resulting in 626 notes with at least one annotated entity for 364 patients. We used a 2-tier taxonomy with these 10 first-level classes (domains) and 52 second-level classes. We developed and validated named entity recognition (NER) systems based on both rule-based and machine learning approaches and validated an entailment model. RESULTS: Annotators achieved a high interrater agreement (Cohen's kappa of 95.3% at document level). A rule-based system (cTAKES), RoBERTa NER, and a hybrid model (combining rules and logistic regression) achieved performance of F1 = 47.1%, 84.4%, and 80.3%, respectively, for first-level classes. DISCUSSION: While the hybrid model had a lower F1 performance, it matched or outperformed RoBERTa NER model in terms of recall and had lower computational requirements. Applying an untuned RoBERTa entailment model, we detected many challenging wordings missed by NER systems. Still, the entailment model may be sensitive to hypothesis wording. CONCLUSION: This study developed a corpus of annotated clinical notes covering a broad spectrum of SDoH classes. This corpus provides a basis for training machine learning models and serves as a benchmark for predictive models for NER for SDoH and knowledge extraction from clinical texts.

Data Analysis of Psychological Approaches to Soccer Research: Using LDA Topic Modeling,"Lee, J.W.; Han, D.H.","This study identifies the topical areas of research that have attempted a psychological approach to soccer research over the last 33 years (1990–2022) and explored the growth and stagnation of the topic as well as research contributions to soccer development. Data were obtained from 1863 papers from the Web of Science database. The data were collected through keyword text mining and data preprocessing to determine the keywords needed for analysis. Based on the keywords, latent Dirichlet allocation-based topic modeling analysis was performed to analyze the topic distribution of papers and explore research trends by topic area. The topic modeling process included four topic area and fifty topics. The “Coaching Essentials in Football” topic area had the highest frequency, but it was not statistically identified as a trend. However, coaching, including training, is expected to continue to be an important research topic, as it is a key requirement for success in the highly competitive elite football world. Interest in the research field of “Psychological Skills for Performance Development” has waned in recent years. This may be due to the predominance of other subject areas rather than a lack of interest. Various high-tech interventions and problem-solving attempts are being made in this field, providing opportunities for qualitative and quantitative expansion. “Motivation, cognition, and emotion” is a largely underrated subject area in soccer psychology. This could be because survey-based psychological evaluation attempts have decreased as the importance of rapid field application has been emphasized in recent soccer-related studies. However, measuring psychological factors contributes to the study of football psychology through a new methodology and theoretical background. Recognizing the important role of psychological factors in player performance and mental management, as well as presenting new research directions and approaches that can be directly applied to the field, will advance soccer psychology research. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,,Behavioral Sciences,13,10,,,10.3390/bs13100787,,#573,Lee 2023,"",""
Digital-Reported Outcome from Medical Notes of Schizophrenia and Bipolar Patients Using Hierarchical BERT,"Khandker, R.K.; Prince, M.R.I.; Chekani, F.; Dexter, P.R.; Boustani, M.A.; Ben Miled, Z.","Patient-reported (PRO) and clinician-reported (CRO) outcomes are assessment instruments that are completed by patients and trained healthcare professionals, respectively. A PRO is a report of the direct experience of the patient with a given disease condition. A CRO is an assessment of the condition of the patient by the healthcare provider. PROs may not be accessible to all patients, especially those suffering from severe disease conditions. CROs are time-consuming and therefore administered infrequently. In the present study, we introduce a new form of assessment, the digital-reported outcome (DRO), which is automatically derived from the medical notes of the patient. DROs have a low overhead and can be generated at each patient’s visit to complement other outcome-assessment instruments and enhance clinical decision support by identifying at-risk patients. In this study, a DRO is developed to evaluate the functional impairment in the daily activities of two cohorts of patients suffering from bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. The input of the DRO is a single medical note from the electronic medical record of the patient. This note is submitted to a hierarchical bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) model. First, a sentence-level embedding is produced for each sentence in the note using a token-level attention mechanism. Second, an embedding for the entire note is constructed using a sentence-level attention mechanism. Third, the final embedding is classified using a feed-forward neural network. The model is trained to classify patients into moderate or severe functioning impairment levels according to the general assessment of functioning (GAF) scale, a CRO instrument for the assessment of the impact of mental illness on the daily activities of the patient. The DRO is validated using medical notes that were labeled by multiple healthcare providers from different healthcare institutions. The results indicate that a general DRO is able to classify patients from the two cohorts according to the two functioning impairment levels (severe versus moderate) prior to the onset of disease with an AUC of 76%. Disease-specific DROs are only applicable after the onset of the disease and produced AUCs of nearly 85%. The methodology introduced in the present paper is practical and can support the automated monitoring of the severity of the functioning impairment of bipolar and schizophrenia patients. Extending the proposed DRO to other psychiatric conditions and types of impairments is the subject of ongoing research work. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,,Information (Switzerland),14,9,,,10.3390/info14090471,,#574,Khandker 2023,"",""
Automated identification of eviction status from electronic health record notes,"Yao, Z.; Tsai, J.; Liu, W.; Levy, D.A.; Druhl, E.; Reisman, J.I.; Yu, H.","OBJECTIVE: Evictions are important social and behavioral determinants of health. Evictions are associated with a cascade of negative events that can lead to unemployment, housing insecurity/homelessness, long-term poverty, and mental health problems. In this study, we developed a natural language processing system to automatically detect eviction status from electronic health record (EHR) notes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We first defined eviction status (eviction presence and eviction period) and then annotated eviction status in 5000 EHR notes from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). We developed a novel model, KIRESH, that has shown to substantially outperform other state-of-the-art models such as fine-tuning pretrained language models like BioBERT and Bio_ClinicalBERT. Moreover, we designed a novel prompt to further improve the model performance by using the intrinsic connection between the 2 subtasks of eviction presence and period prediction. Finally, we used the Temperature Scaling-based Calibration on our KIRESH-Prompt method to avoid overconfidence issues arising from the imbalance dataset. RESULTS: KIRESH-Prompt substantially outperformed strong baseline models including fine-tuning the Bio_ClinicalBERT model to achieve 0.74672 MCC, 0.71153 Macro-F1, and 0.83396 Micro-F1 in predicting eviction period and 0.66827 MCC, 0.62734 Macro-F1, and 0.7863 Micro-F1 in predicting eviction presence. We also conducted additional experiments on a benchmark social determinants of health (SBDH) dataset to demonstrate the generalizability of our methods. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK: KIRESH-Prompt has substantially improved eviction status classification. We plan to deploy KIRESH-Prompt to the VHA EHRs as an eviction surveillance system to help address the US Veterans' housing insecurity. © The Author(s) 2023.

Depression detection via conversation turn classification,"Lu, K.-C.; Thamrin, S.A.; Chen, A.L.P.","The fast pace of modern life caused people to experience more pressure from their surrounding environments. As a result, depression has emerged as one of the most common diseases. To detect depression, psychiatrists need to interview patients to understand their mental health condition. However, it may not fully reflect the condition of the patient since some people cannot adequately express their feelings. As an alternative, researchers work on automated depression detection. Our work aims to improve the detection capability by extracting knowledge from psychiatric consultation. Previous studies classified the questions and answers in the interview into categories unrelated directly to depression. In this paper, we implement a novel categorization based on the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8). The PHQ-8 is commonly used as a screening tool to identify the severity of depression, making it more reliable for detecting depression. Transcribed data is processed using contextual word embedding, BERT, to learn semantic information. In the final step, a transformer encoder is used to get a higher-level representation of turns. Using categorization based on PHQ-8 and BERT as word embedding, we propose a novel deep learning framework with two-level encoding for detecting depression. In the training step, we use Distress Analysis Interview Corpus (DAIC) dataset, a transcript of the interview data. The model is evaluated with different adjustments to achieve the best performance. Various experiments are designed to show the effectiveness of our method for detecting depression from the psychiatric consultation dataset. As a result, our model performs better than others using the same dataset, achieving 0.76 F1-score. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2023,,Multimedia Tools and Applications,82,25,39393-39413,,10.1007/s11042-023-15103-8,,#577,Lu 2023,"",""

Methods We used primary care electronic health record data until the end of December 2020 from The Health Improvement Network (THIN), a Cegedim database. We included adults registered with participating practices in England, Scotland or Wales. We extracted information about 89 symptoms and ‘Long Covid’ diagnoses from free text using natural language processing. We calculated hazard ratios (adjusted for age, sex, baseline medical conditions and prior symptoms) for each symptom from 12 weeks after the COVID-19 diagnosis. Results We compared 11,015 patients with confirmed COVID-19 and 18,098 unexposed controls. Only 20% of symptom records were coded, with 80% in free text. A wide range of symptoms were associated with COVID-19 at least 12 weeks post-infection, with strongest associations for fatigue (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 3.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.87, 4.17), shortness of breath (aHR 2.89, 95% CI 2.48, 3.36), palpitations (aHR 2.59, 95% CI 1.86, 3.60), and phlegm (aHR 2.43, 95% CI 1.65, 3.59).

Can Artificial Intelligence aid communication? Considering the possibilities of GPT-3 in Palliative care,"Srivastava, R.; Srivastava, S.","Objectives: This article reviews the developments in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and their current and prospective applications in end-of-life communications. It uses Open AI’s generative pre-trained transformer 3 (GPT-3) as a case study to understand the possibilities of AI-aided communication in Palliative Care. Material and Methods: Open AI’s GPT-3 was taken as a case study where responses were generated through the GPT-3 beta playground (Davinci engine) and were scrutinised by six mental health professionals (MHPs) working in a palliative care setting in India. They were tasked to evaluate the responses generated by the AI (the identity was not revealed until a part of the study was completed) in a simulated palliative care conversation with another MHP posing as a patient. The aim was to undermine whether the professionals were able to detect that the responses were indeed generated by a machine and did they approve or disapprove of the responses. Results: The GPT-3 playground with the right prompts produced remarkable, often surprising texts and responses that imitated human interaction. However, glitches such as redundancy were noticed along with strongly held opinions in certain questions related to faith, death, and life after death. Conclusion: AI-assisted communication in palliative care could be used to train professionals in the palliative care field using it as a simulation in training. It could also be used as a therapeutic intervention for the purpose of engagement and philosophical dialogue after certain modifications.

Contrastive Learning of Stress-specific Word Embedding for Social Media based Stress Detection,"Wang, X.; Zhang, H.; Cao, L.; Zeng, K.; Li, Q.; Li, N.; Feng, L.","Detecting stress via user's social media posts has attracted increasing research interests in recent years. The majority of the methods leverage word embeddings to represent each of the posted words as a vector, and then perform classification on a sequence of word vectors.

However, information regarding them is not always collected in healthcare interactions, and healthcare professionals are not always well-trained or equipped to address them. Emergency medical services (EMS) professionals are uniquely positioned to observe and attend to SDoH because of their presence in patients’ environments; however, the transmission of that information may be lost during transitions of care. Documentation of SDoH in EMS records may be helpful in identifying and addressing patients’ insecurities and improving their health outcomes. Our objective in this study was to determine the presence of SDoH information in adult EMS records and understand how such information is referenced, appraised, and linked to other determinants by EMS personnel. Methods: Using EMS records for adult patients in the 2019 ESO Data Collaborative public-use research dataset using a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm, we identified free-text narratives containing documentation of at least one SDoH from categories associated with food, housing, employment, insurance, financial, and social support insecurities. From the NLP corpus, we randomly selected 100 records from each of the SDoH categories for qualitative content analysis using grounded theory. Results: Of the 5,665,229 records analyzed by the NLP algorithm, 175,378 (3.1%) were identified as containing at least one reference to SDoH. References to those SDoH were centered around the social topics of accessibility, mental health, physical health, and substance use. There were infrequent explicit references to other SDoH in the EMS records, but some relationships between categories could be inferred from contexts. Appraisals of patients’ employment, food, and housing insecurities were mostly negative. Narratives including social support and financial insecurities were less negatively appraised, while those regarding insurance insecurities were mostly neutral and related to EMS operations and procedures. Conclusion: The social determinants of health are infrequently documented in EMS records. When they are included, they are infrequently explicitly linked to other SDoH categories and are often negatively appraised by EMS professionals. Given their unique position to observe and share patients’ SDoH information, EMS professionals should be trained to understand, document, and address SDoH in their practice. © 2023 Burnett et al.",2023,,Western Journal of Emergency Medicine,24,5,878-887,,10.5811/WESTJEM.59070,,#588,Burnett 2023,"",""
Identifying Type II workplace violence from clinical notes using natural language processing,"Byon, H.D.; Harris, C.; Crandall, M.; Song, J.; Topaz, M.","Background: Type II workplace violence in health care, perpetrated by patients/clients toward home healthcare nurses, is a serious health and safety issue. A significant portion of violent incidents are not officially reported. Natural language processing can detect these “hidden cases” from clinical notes. In this study, we computed the 12-month prevalence of Type II workplace violence from home healthcare nurses’ clinical notes by developing and utilizing a natural language processing system. Methods: Nearly 600,000 clinical visit notes from two large U.S.-based home healthcare agencies were analyzed. The notes were recorded from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019. Rule- and machine-learning-based natural language processing algorithms were applied to identify clinical notes containing workplace violence descriptions. Results: The natural language processing algorithms identified 236 clinical notes that included Type II workplace violence toward home healthcare nurses. The prevalence of physical violence was 0.067 incidents per 10,000 home visits. The prevalence of nonphysical violence was 3.76 incidents per 10,000 home visits. The prevalence of any violence was four incidents per 10,000 home visits. In comparison, no Type II workplace violence incidents were recorded in the official incident report systems of the two agencies in this same time period. Conclusions and Application to Practice: Natural language processing can be an effective tool to augment formal reporting by capturing violence incidents from daily, ongoing, large volumes of clinical notes. It can enable managers and clinicians to stay informed of potential violence risks and keep their practice environment safe. © 2023 The Author(s).",2023,,Workplace Health and Safety,71,10,484-490,,10.1177/21650799231176078,,#589,Byon 2023,"",""
Recommendations for Social Work Researchers and Journal Editors on the Use of Generative AI and Large Language Models,"Victor, B.G.; Sokol, R.L.; Goldkind, L.; Perron, B.E.","Generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) are poised to significantly impact social work research. These technologies can produce high-quality written materials and support qualitative and quantitative data analysis with simple, plain-language prompts from users. However, they also introduce challenges, such as potential bias, data privacy concerns, and generation of misinformation. In this paper, we use a disruptive–disrupting framework to discuss the dual nature of generative AI and LLMs and offer recommendations for social work researchers and journal editors that include guidance around data collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination. Researchers must use great caution when deploying generative AI technologies, meticulously examining, verifying, and taking accountability for the text and analyses produced by these instruments. Likewise, journal editors will need to implement quality control procedures and ethical standards to guide and evaluate the use of these technologies in social work research. We consider the recommendations offered here as a point of departure for disciplinary conversations about the role of generative AI and LLMs in social work research. © 2023 Society for Social Work and Research.

Artificial Cognition for Detection of Mental Disability: A Vision Transformer Approach for Alzheimer’s Disease,"Almufareh, M.F.; Tehsin, S.; Humayun, M.; Kausar, S.","Alzheimer’s disease is a common neurological disorder and mental disability that causes memory loss and cognitive decline, presenting a major challenge to public health due to its impact on millions of individuals worldwide. It is crucial to diagnose and treat Alzheimer’s in a timely manner to improve the quality of life of both patients and caregivers. In the recent past, machine learning techniques have showed potential in detecting Alzheimer’s disease by examining neuroimaging data, especially Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). This research proposes an attention-based mechanism that employs the vision transformer approach to detect Alzheimer’s using MRI images. The presented technique applies preprocessing to the MRI images and forwards them to a vision transformer network for classification. This network is trained on the publicly available Kaggle dataset, and it illustrated impressive results with an accuracy of 99.06%, precision of 99.06%, recall of 99.14%, and F1-score of 99.1%.

Multitask learning for recognizing stress and depression in social media,"Ilias, L.; Askounis, D.","Stress and depression are prevalent nowadays across people of all ages due to the quick paces of life. People use social media to express their feelings. Thus, social media constitute a valuable form of information for the early recognition of stress and depression. Although many research works have been introduced targeting the early recognition of stress and depression, there are still limitations. There have been proposed multi-task learning settings, which use depression and emotion (or figurative language) as the primary and auxiliary tasks respectively. However, although stress is inextricably linked with depression, researchers face these two tasks as two separate tasks. To address these limitations, we present the first study, which exploits two different datasets collected under different conditions, and introduce two multitask learning frameworks, which use depression and stress as the main and auxiliary tasks respectively. Specifically, we use a depression dataset and a stressful dataset including stressful posts from ten subreddits of five domains. In terms of the first approach, each post passes through a shared BERT layer, which is updated by both tasks. Next, two separate BERT encoder layers are exploited, which are updated by each task separately. Regarding the second approach, it consists of shared and task-specific layers weighted by attention fusion networks. We conduct a series of experiments and compare our approaches with existing research initiatives, single-task learning, and transfer learning. Experiments show multiple advantages of our approaches over state-of-the-art ones. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",2023,,Online Social Networks and Media,37-38,,,,10.1016/j.osnem.2023.100270,,#596,Ilias 2023,"",""
Sentiment Data Analysis for Detecting Social Sense after COVID-19 using Hybrid Optimization Method,"Seth, R.; Sharaff, A.","Sentiment analysis is the most effective way to understand opinions presented in digital media. Social sense is the concept of understanding every user's emotions connected through an online social media platform. This emotion helps to understand the mental health of people. Every stage of extracting social impact contains several problems with several methods associated with it, like lexicon-based techniques, which were proposed, developed, and evaluated but sometimes had poor accuracy. Machine Learning (ML) is useful to recognize patterns, in various aspects of sentiment analysis and it will best suited for this traditional algorithm where the large dataset is chunked into the smaller dataset to train the model. NLP methods do not account for different domains when modeling sentiment information. In a classification dilemma, reducing the feature set size diminishes the algorithm's time demand while improving the method's accuracy to obtain the optimal features. Scalability refers to handling large amounts of data and performing several computations like time and cost efficiently. This paper's perspective is to overcome the shortcomings of each system, and this article proposes a hybrid approach to sentiment analysis. Data has been collected from Twitter via the Twitter API. This research investigates the effects of negations, URLs, usernames, punctuation, repeated character normalization, and hashtags on sentiment classification output using an n-gram representation model, which is a kind of probabilistic language model and also integrates a cross-domain sentiment-aware learning model that can collect both sentiment awareness and domain validity of a word simultaneously to solve the problem of words from various domains. To fix the scalability problem, the article offers the novel Tunicate Swarm Algorithm (TSA), which increases scalability and reduces computation time. Meanwhile, this paper custom a hybrid Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm based on simulated annealing (SA) and bitwise operations to solve the local optima problem. This proposed work results in the sentiment score that people with positive sentiments are more than those with negative. The proposed model gives better feature size reduction measured using the correlation coefficient metric and comparing other state-of-the-art algorithms like the wrapper approach, particle swarm optimization, and greedy feature selection with a reduction in feature size of up to 64%. The precision–recall curve ranges toward one, which means the classifier does classification accurately. In the sentiment analysis of Twitter feedback, the suggested solution has greater exactness and scalability with 96 s. The proposed model is well-trained, and the best validation is achieved at the 4th epoch with 0.6672. The area under the ROC curve evaluates the separability near one that shows the proposed model works excellently. The claim of a proposed model has been validated through comparison from different classifiers like Naïve Bayes, kNN, Random Forest, CNN-RNN, and AC-BiLSTM with admissible accuracy of 96.37%. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",2023,,SN Computer Science,4,5,,,10.1007/s42979-023-02017-3,,#598,Seth 2023,"",""
HbA1c recording in patients following a first diagnosis of serious mental illness: The South London and Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre case register,"Bell, N.; Perera, G.; Chandran, D.; Stubbs, B.; Gaughran, F.; Stewart, R.","Objectives To investigate factors associated with the recording of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in people with first diagnoses of serious mental illness (SMI) in a large mental healthcare provider, and factors associated with HbA1c levels, when recorded. To our knowledge this is the first such investigation, although attention to dysglycaemia in SMI is an increasing priority in mental healthcare. Design The study was primarily descriptive in nature, seeking to ascertain the frequency of HbA1c recording in the mental healthcare sector for people following first SMI diagnosis. Settings A large mental healthcare provider, the South London and Maudsley National Health Service Trust. Participants Using electronic mental health records data, we ascertained patients with first SMI diagnoses (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder) from 2008 to 2018. Outcome measures Recording or not of HbA1c level was ascertained from routine local laboratory data and supplemented by a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm for extracting recorded values in text fields (precision 0.89%, recall 0.93%). Age, gender, ethnic group, year of diagnosis, and SMI diagnosis were investigated as covariates in relation to recording or not of HbA1c and first recorded levels. Results Of 21 462 patients in the sample (6546 bipolar disorder; 14 916 schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder; mean age 38.8 years, 49% female), 4106 (19.1%) had at least one HbA1c result recorded from laboratory data, increasing to 6901 (32.2%) following NLP. HbA1c recording was independently more likely in non-white ethnic groups (black compared with white: OR 2.45, 95% CI 2.29 to 2.62), and was negatively associated with age (OR per year increase 0.93, 0.92-0.95), female gender (0.83, 0.78-0.88) and bipolar disorder (0.49, 0.45-0.52). Conclusions Over a 10-year period, relatively low level of recording of HbA1c was observed, although this has increased over time and ascertainment was increased with text extraction. It remains important to improve the routine monitoring of dysglycaemia in these at-risk disorders. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. Re-use permitted under CC BY.

Does pain matter in the Australian Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety? A text mining study,"Atee, M.; Andreotta, M.; Lloyd, R.; Whiting, D.; Alford, M.; Morris, T.","Background: Pain is often poorly documented, assessed and managed in the Australian aged care sector. The Australian Government called for the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety (RC) to investigate the serious concerns, neglects and abuses including the inadequate pain management seen in the sector. This study examined the degree to which the RC discussed the issue of pain in their published reports and recommendations. Methods: A text mining study with a computer-assisted term frequency analysis identified mentions of the word “pain” in the text of two key reports produced by the RC: the Interim Report and the Final Report. Main outcome measures included frequency of mentions of “pain”, cumulative percentile rank of the word “pain”, proportion of words that were “pain”, and frequency of mentions of the word “pain” in quotes. Results: The word “pain” was mentioned often in the Interim Report (n = 10, 0.03% of all words, 87th percentile) and the Final Report (n = 218, 0.05% of all words, 97th percentile). However, the word “pain” was absent from final recommendations of the RC. Conclusions: Although the RC discussed pain in their reports, the topic was omitted from recommendations, reflecting a lack of attention to the presented evidence. Without specific recommendations for pain management, a disconnection may arise between targeted polices, programs and funding schemes, and the clinical practice. Thus, older adults living in the community and residential aged care homes may remain vulnerable. © 2023 The Authors",2023,,Aging and Health Research,3,1,,,10.1016/j.ahr.2023.100126,,#602,Atee 2023,"",""
Attention-Enabled Ensemble Deep Learning Models and Their Validation for Depression Detection: A Domain Adoption Paradigm,"Singh, J.; Singh, N.; Fouda, M.M.; Saba, L.; Suri, J.S.","Depression is increasingly prevalent, leading to higher suicide risk. Depression detection and sentimental analysis of text inputs in cross-domain frameworks are challenging. Solo deep learning (SDL) and ensemble deep learning (EDL) models are not robust enough. Recently, attention mechanisms have been introduced in SDL. We hypothesize that attention-enabled EDL (aeEDL) architectures are superior compared to attention-not-enabled SDL (aneSDL) or aeSDL models. We designed EDL-based architectures with attention blocks to build eleven kinds of SDL model and five kinds of EDL model on four domain-specific datasets. We scientifically validated our models by comparing “seen” and “unseen” paradigms (SUP). We benchmarked our results against the SemEval (2016) sentimental dataset and established reliability tests. The mean increase in accuracy for EDL over their corresponding SDL components was 4.49%. Regarding the effect of attention block, the increase in the mean accuracy (AUC) of aeSDL over aneSDL was 2.58% (1.73%), and the increase in the mean accuracy (AUC) of aeEDL over aneEDL was 2.76% (2.80%). When comparing EDL vs. SDL for non-attention and attention, the mean aneEDL was greater than aneSDL by 4.82% (3.71%), and the mean aeEDL was greater than aeSDL by 5.06% (4.81%). For the benchmarking dataset (SemEval), the best-performing aeEDL model (ALBERT+BERT-BiLSTM) was superior to the best aeSDL (BERT-BiLSTM) model by 3.86%. Our scientific validation and robust design showed a difference of only 2.7% in SUP, thereby meeting the regulatory constraints. We validated all our hypotheses and further demonstrated that aeEDL is a very effective and generalized method for detecting symptoms of depression in cross-domain settings. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,,Diagnostics,13,12,,,10.3390/diagnostics13122092,,#604,Singh 2023,"",""
Identifying suicidal emotions on social media through transformer-based deep learning,"Kodati, D.; Tene, R.","Suicide-related cases throughout the world are increasing on a day-to-day basis. This is owing to lack of control on negative human emotions which lead one to take one’s life. Due to rapid development of social media, users are posting their views and daily activities including texts related to suicide. This research identifies negative emotions in suicidal postings which describe an individual’s mental health. We proposed two models for detecting negative emotions like anger, anxiety, depression, guilt, fear, sadness, and stress on social media. Our first model is a context-based bidirectional gated recurrent unit with multi-head attention and a convolutional neural network (C-BiGRU-MHA-CNN) that is meant for preserving contextual data and for maintaining long-term dependencies. This paper proposes the masked language modeling (MLM) and self-attention (SA) mechanism procedures for model training and to detect contextual features over context-free models. We also suggested the lexicon-based bidirectional long short-term memory with multi-head attention and convolutional neural network (L-BiLSTM-MHA-CNN) model. It is a single channel-based model that performs better when it comes to dealing with the lexicon-based approach against erstwhile methods. It combines input features with parts-of-speech (POS) tagging can train on embedding representations for identifying emotions, while recognizing those which are the most dominant in suicide-related texts. We compared the performance of our models with various word embeddings. We also conducted an ablation study in order to highlight the contribution of the most essential components in our models for achieving better performance.

From benchmark to bedside: transfer learning from social media to patient-provider text messages for suicide risk prediction,"Burkhardt, H.A.; Ding, X.; Kerbrat, A.; Comtois, K.A.; Cohen, T.","Objective: Compared to natural language processing research investigating suicide risk prediction with social media (SM) data, research utilizing data from clinical settings are scarce. However, the utility of models trained on SM data in text from clinical settings remains unclear. In addition, commonly used performance metrics do not directly translate to operational value in a real-world deployment. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the utility of SM-derived training data for suicide risk prediction in a clinical setting and to develop a metric of the clinical utility of automated triage of patient messages for suicide risk. Materials and Methods: Using clinical data, we developed a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers-based suicide risk detection model to identify messages indicating potential suicide risk. We used both annotated and unlabeled suicide-related SM posts for multi-stage transfer learning, leveraging customized contemporary learning rate schedules. We also developed a novel metric estimating predictive models' potential to reduce follow-up delays with patients in distress and used it to assess model utility. Results: Multi-stage transfer learning from SM data outperformed baseline approaches by traditional classification performance metrics, improving performance from 0.734 to a best F1 score of 0.797. Using this approach for automated triage could reduce response times by 15 minutes per urgent message. Discussion: Despite differences in data characteristics and distribution, publicly available SM data benefit clinical suicide risk prediction when used in conjunction with contemporary transfer learning techniques. Estimates of time saved due to automated triage indicate the potential for the practical impact of such models when deployed as part of established suicide prevention interventions. Conclusions: This work demonstrates a pathway for leveraging publicly available SM data toward improving risk assessment, paving the way for better clinical care and improved clinical outcomes.  © 2023 The Author(s).

Response-act Guided Reinforced Dialogue Generation for Mental Health Counseling,"Srivastava, A.; Pandey, I.; Akhtar, M.S.; Chakraborty, T.","Virtual Mental Health Assistants (VMHAs) have become a prevalent method for receiving mental health counseling in the digital healthcare space. An assistive counseling conversation commences with natural open-ended topics to familiarize the client with the environment and later converges into more fine-grained domain-specific topics. Unlike other conversational systems, which are categorized as open-domain or task-oriented systems, VMHAs possess a hybrid conversational flow. These counseling bots need to comprehend various aspects of the conversation, such as dialogue-acts, intents, etc., to engage the client in an effective and appropriate conversation. Although the surge in digital health research highlights applications of many general-purpose response generation systems, they are barely suitable in the mental health domain - the prime reason is the lack of understanding in the mental health counseling conversation. Moreover, in general, dialogue-act guided response generators are either limited to a template-based paradigm or lack appropriate semantics in dialogue generation. To this end, we propose READER - a REsponse-Act guided reinforced Dialogue genERation model for the mental health counseling conversations. READER is built on transformer to jointly predict a potential dialogue-act dt + 1 for the next utterance (aka response-act) and to generate an appropriate response (ut + 1). Through the transformer-reinforcement-learning (TRL) with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we guide the response generator to abide by dt + 1 and ensure the semantic richness of the responses via BERTScore in our reward computation.

Physicians’ Online Writing Language Style and Patient Satisfaction: The Mediator of Depth of Physician–Patient Interactions,"Liu, J.; Jiang, H.; Wang, S.","Online health counseling (OHC) is increasingly important in modern healthcare. This development has attracted considerable attention from researchers. However, the reality of the lack of physician–patient communication and dissatisfaction with online health services remains prevalent, and more research is needed to raise awareness about important issues related to OHC services, especially in terms of patient satisfaction and depth of interaction (i.e., the product of the number of interactions and the relevance of the content). This study constructs an empirical model to explore the relationship between physicians’ online writing language style (inclusive language and emojis), depth of physician–patient interactions, and patient satisfaction. The study obtained 5064 online health counseling records from 337 pediatricians and analyzed them using text mining and empirical methods.

Empowering machine learning models with contextual knowledge for enhancing the detection of eating disorders in social media posts,"Benítez-Andrades, J.A.; García-Ordás, M.T.; Russo, M.; Sakor, A.; Fernandes Rotger, L.D.; Vidal, M.-E.","Social networks have become information dissemination channels, where announcements are posted frequently; they also serve as frameworks for debates in various areas (e.g., scientific, political, and social). In particular, in the health area, social networks represent a channel to communicate and disseminate novel treatments' success; they also allow ordinary people to express their concerns about a disease or disorder. The Artificial Intelligence (AI) community has developed analytical methods to uncover and predict patterns from posts that enable it to explain news about a particular topic, e.g., mental disorders expressed as eating disorders or depression. Albeit potentially rich while expressing an idea or concern, posts are presented as short texts, preventing, thus, AI models from accurately encoding these posts' contextual knowledge. We propose a hybrid approach where knowledge encoded in community-maintained knowledge graphs (e.g., Wikidata) is combined with deep learning to categorize social media posts using existing classification models. The proposed approach resorts to state-of-the-art named entity recognizers and linkers (e.g., Falcon 2.0) to extract entities in short posts and link them to concepts in knowledge graphs. Then, knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs) are utilized to compute latent representations of the extracted entities, which result in vector representations of the posts that encode these entities' contextual knowledge extracted from the knowledge graphs. These KGEs are combined with contextualized word embeddings (e.g., BERT) to generate a context-based representation of the posts that empower prediction models. We apply our proposed approach in the health domain to detect whether a publication is related to an eating disorder (e.g., anorexia or bulimia) and uncover concepts within the discourse that could help healthcare providers diagnose this type of mental disorder. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of 2,000 tweets about eating disorders. Our experimental results suggest that combining contextual knowledge encoded in word embeddings with the one built from knowledge graphs increases the reliability of the predictive models. The ambition is that the proposed method can support health domain experts in discovering patterns that may forecast a mental disorder, enhancing early detection and more precise diagnosis towards personalized medicine.  © 2023 - The authors.

An analysis of Chinese nursing electronic medical records to predict violence in psychiatric inpatients using text mining and machine learning techniques,"Hu, Y.-H.; Hung, J.-H.; Hu, L.-Y.; Huang, S.-Y.; Shen, C.-C.","Background The prevalence of violence in acute psychiatric wards is a critical concern. According to a meta-analysis investigating violence in psychiatric inpatient units, researchers estimated that approximately 17% of inpatients commit one or more acts of violence during their stay. Inpatient violence negatively affects health-care providers and patients and may contribute to high staff turnover. Therefore, predicting which psychiatric inpatients will commit violence is of considerable clinical significance. Objective The present study aimed to estimate the violence rate for psychiatric inpatients and establish a predictive model for violence in psychiatric inpatients. Methods We collected the structured and unstructured data from Chinese nursing electronic medical records (EMRs) for the violence prediction. The data was obtained from the psychiatry department of a regional hospital in southern Taiwan, covering the period between January 2008 and December 2018. Several text mining and machine learning techniques were employed to analyze the data. Results The results demonstrated that the rate of violence in psychiatric inpatients is 19.7%. The patients with violence in psychiatric wards were generally younger, had a more violent history, and were more likely to be unmarried. Furthermore, our study supported the feasibility of predicting aggressive incidents in psychiatric wards by using nursing EMRs and the proposed method can be incorporated into routine clinical practice to enable early prediction of inpatient violence. Conclusions Our findings may provide clinicians with a new basis for judgment of the risk of violence in psychiatric wards. © 2023 Hu et al.

Children with Disabilities in Canada during the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Analysis of COVID-19 Policies through a Disability Rights Lens,"Shikako, K.; Lencucha, R.; Hunt, M.; Jodoin-Pilon, S.; Chandra, A.; Katalifos, A.; Gonzalez, M.; Yamaguchi, S.; Cardoso, R.; Elsabbagh, M.; Hudon, A.; Martens, R.; Cogburn, D.; Seth, A.; Currie, G.; Roth, C.; Finlay, B.; Zwicker, J.","Children with disabilities were especially vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic, and policies designed to mitigate its effects were limited in addressing their needs. We analyzed Canadian policies related to children with disabilities and their families during the COVID-19 pandemic to identify the extent to which these policies aligned with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN CRPD) and responded to their mental health needs by conducting a systematic collection of Canadian provincial/territorial policies produced during the pandemic, building a categorization dictionary based on the UN CRPD, using text mining, and thematic analysis to identify policies’ alignment with the UN CRPD and mental health supports. Mental health was addressed as a factor of importance in many policy documents, but specific interventions to promote or treat mental health were scarce. Most public health policies and recommendations are related to educational settings, demonstrating how public health for children with disabilities relies on education and community that may be out of the healthcare system and unavailable during extended periods of the pandemic. Policies often acknowledged the challenges faced by children with disabilities and their families but offered few mitigation strategies with limited considerations for human rights protection. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,,Children,10,6,,,10.3390/children10060942,,#631,Shikako 2023,"",""
Empirical study of factors that influence the perceived usefulness of online mental health community members,"Li, J.; Liu, D.; Wan, C.; Liang, Z.; Zhu, T.","Online mental health communities have become a major platform where individuals can talk about their mental health problems and obtain social support. This study aims to understand the antecedents of perceived usefulness among members in an online mental health community, while providing reference for the managers and users of online mental health communities. We obtained a total of 143,190 posts from ReachOut.com released by the CLPsych2017 shared task. Then, we used text mining to derive the independent and dependent variables. Next, a structural equation model observing the perceived usefulness of online mental health community members was constructed from the perspective of an information adoption model. The informativeness of help-seeking posts had a significant positive relationship with the information quality of reply posts; the information quality of reply posts was a significant positive predictor of perceived usefulness, with the information quality of reply posts partially mediating the relationship between the informativeness of help-seeking posts and perceived usefulness. The information provided by online mental health community members' help-seeking posts and the quality of replies were found to be the factors that influenced perceived usefulness. This study highlights the importance of the information quality of reply posts and provides useful insights for administrators who can help users to improve their response quality and obtain the support they need. © 2023 Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.",2023,,PsyCh Journal,12,2,307-318,,10.1002/pchj.629,,#633,Li 2023,"",""
Behind the ChatGPT Hype: Are Its Suggestions Contributing to Addiction?,"Haman, M.; Školník, M.","ChatGPT has been a frequent topic of discussion lately. All over the Internet, from YouTube to blogs, there have been reports about how ChatGPT is able to plan people's daily activities, even for a whole month. However, what matters is what activities ChatGPT recommends. When ChatGPT was trained on a vast amount of data from the Internet, we wondered if it would suggest activities that can lead to addiction. In our test, not once did ChatGPT recommend an activity related to alcohol, drug use, or any other activity that can lead to addiction with serious health consequences. Suggestions seemed more like self-improvement posts on blogs than discussion forums where people might mention drinking in the evenings. Thus, if a person were to use ChatGPT as a personal lifestyle advisor, it does not appear on the basis of this test that ChatGPT would recommend activities that would be fundamentally detrimental to their health. However, more detailed long-term testing of similar tools is needed before recommendations for use in practice can be made. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Biomedical Engineering Society.",2023,,Annals of Biomedical Engineering,51,6,1128-1129,,10.1007/s10439-023-03201-5,,#635,Haman 2023,"",""
Sustainable Artificial Intelligence-Based Twitter Sentiment Analysis on COVID-19 Pandemic,"Vaiyapuri, T.; Jagannathan, S.K.; Ahmed, M.A.; Ramya, K.C.; Joshi, G.P.; Lee, S.; Lee, G.","The COVID-19 outbreak is a disastrous event that has elevated many psychological problems such as lack of employment and depression given abrupt social changes. Simultaneously, psychologists and social scientists have drawn considerable attention towards understanding how people express their sentiments and emotions during the pandemic. With the rise in COVID-19 cases with strict lockdowns, people expressed their opinions publicly on social networking platforms. This provides a deeper knowledge of human psychology at the time of disastrous events. By applying user-produced content on social networking platforms such as Twitter, the sentiments and views of people are analyzed to assist in introducing awareness campaigns and health intervention policies. The modern evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) mechanisms has revealed remarkable performance in sentimental analysis (SA). This study develops a new Marine Predator Optimization with Natural Language Processing for Twitter Sentiment Analysis (MPONLP-TSA) for the COVID-19 Pandemic. The presented MPONLP-TSA model is focused on the recognition of sentiments that exist in the Twitter data during the COVID-19 pandemic. The presented MPONLP-TSA technique undergoes data preprocessing to convert the data into a useful format. Furthermore, the BERT model is used to derive word vectors. To detect and classify sentiments, a bidirectional recurrent neural network (BiRNN) model is utilized. Finally, the MPO algorithm is exploited for optimal hyperparameter tuning process, and it assists in enhancing the overall classification performance. The experimental validation of the MPONLP-TSA approach can be tested by utilizing the COVID-19 tweets dataset from the Kaggle repository. A wide comparable study reported a better outcome of the MPONLP-TSA method over current approaches. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,,Sustainability (Switzerland),15,8,,,10.3390/su15086404,,#639,Vaiyapuri 2023,"",""
Roman Urdu Hate Speech Detection Using Transformer-Based Model for Cyber Security Applications,"Bilal, M.; Khan, A.; Jan, S.; Musa, S.; Ali, S.","Social media applications, such as Twitter and Facebook, allow users to communicate and share their thoughts, status updates, opinions, photographs, and videos around the globe. Unfortunately, some people utilize these platforms to disseminate hate speech and abusive language. The growth of hate speech may result in hate crimes, cyber violence, and substantial harm to cyberspace, physical security, and social safety. As a result, hate speech detection is a critical issue for both cyberspace and physical society, necessitating the development of a robust application capable of detecting and combating it in real-time. Hate speech detection is a context-dependent problem that requires context-aware mechanisms for resolution. In this study, we employed a transformer-based model for Roman Urdu hate speech classification due to its ability to capture the text context. In addition, we developed the first Roman Urdu pre-trained BERT model, which we named BERT-RU. For this purpose, we exploited the capabilities of BERT by training it from scratch on the largest Roman Urdu dataset consisting of 173,714 text messages. Traditional and deep learning models were used as baseline models, including LSTM, BiLSTM, BiLSTM + Attention Layer, and CNN. We also investigated the concept of transfer learning by using pre-trained BERT embeddings in conjunction with deep learning models. The performance of each model was evaluated in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure. The generalization of each model was evaluated on a cross-domain dataset. The experimental results revealed that the transformer-based model, when directly applied to the classification task of the Roman Urdu hate speech, outperformed traditional machine learning, deep learning models, and pre-trained transformer-based models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure, with scores of 96.70%, 97.25%, 96.74%, and 97.89%, respectively. In addition, the transformer-based model exhibited superior generalization on a cross-domain dataset. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,,Sensors,23,8,,,10.3390/s23083909,,#640,Bilal 2023,"",""
"Dynamic suicide topic modelling: Deriving population-specific, psychosocial and time-sensitive suicide risk variables from Electronic Health Record psychotherapy notes","Levis, M.; Levy, J.; Dufort, V.; Russ, C.J.; Shiner, B.","In the machine learning subfield of natural language processing, a topic model is a type of unsupervised method that is used to uncover abstract topics within a corpus of text. Dynamic topic modelling (DTM) is used for capturing change in these topics over time. The study deploys DTM on corpus of electronic health record psychotherapy notes. This retrospective study examines whether DTM helps distinguish closely matched patients that did and did not die by suicide. Cohort consists of United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) patients diagnosed with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) between 2004 and 2013. Each case (those who died by suicide during the year following diagnosis) was matched with five controls (those who remained alive) that shared psychotherapists and had similar suicide risk based on VA's suicide prediction algorithm. Cohort was restricted to patients who received psychotherapy for 9+ months after initial PTSD diagnoses (cases = 77; controls = 362). For cases, psychotherapy notes from diagnosis until death were examined. For controls, psychotherapy notes from diagnosis until matched case's death date were examined. A Python-based DTM algorithm was utilized. Derived topics identified population-specific themes, including PTSD, psychotherapy, medication, communication and relationships. Control topics changed significantly more over time than case topics. Topic differences highlighted engagement, expressivity and therapeutic alliance.

Methods Between January 2000 and March 2019, 21,469 primary and revision arthroplasties (10,011 THAs; 11,458 TKAs), which were undertaken in 15,504 patients at a single academic medical centre, were identified from a 27-county linked electronic medical record (EMR) system. Depressive and anxiety disorders were identified by diagnoses in the EMR or by using a natural language processing program with subsequent validation from review of the medical records. Patients with mental health diagnoses other than anxiety or depression were excluded. Results Depressive and/or anxiety disorders were common before THA and TKA, with a prevalence of 30% in those who underwent primary THA, 33% in those who underwent revision THA, 32% in those who underwent primary TKA, and 35% in those who underwent revision TKA. The presence of depressive or anxiety disorders was associated with a significantly increased risk of any infection (primary THA, hazard ratio (HR) 1.5; revision THA, HR 1.9; primary TKA, HR 1.6; revision TKA, HR 1.8), revision (THA, HR 1.7; TKA, HR 1.6), re-revision (THA, HR 2.0; TKA, HR 1.6), and reoperation (primary THA, HR 1.6; revision THA, HR 2.2; primary TKA, HR 1.4; revision TKA, HR 1.9; p < 0.03 for all). Patients with preoperative depressive and/or anxiety disorders were significantly less likely to report “much better” joint function after primary THA (78% vs 87%) and primary TKA (86% vs 90%) compared with those without these disorders at two years postoperatively (p < 0.001 for all). Conclusion The presence of depressive or anxiety disorders prior to primary or revision THA and TKA is common, and associated with a significantly higher risk of infection, revision, reoperation, and dissatisfaction.

Detecting intimate partner violence circumstance for suicide: Development and validation of a tool using natural language processing and supervised machine learning in the National Violent Death Reporting System,"Kafka, J.M.; Fliss, M.D.; Trangenstein, P.J.; McNaughton Reyes, L.; Pence, B.W.; Moracco, K.E.","Background Intimate partner violence (IPV) victims and perpetrators often report suicidal ideation, yet there is no comprehensive national dataset that allows for an assessment of the connection between IPV and suicide. The National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) captures IPV circumstances for homicide-suicides (<2% of suicides), but not single suicides (suicide unconnected to other violent deaths; >98% of suicides). Objective To facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of the co-occurrence of IPV and suicide, we developed and validated a tool that detects mentions of IPV circumstances (yes/no) for single suicides in NVDRS death narratives. Methods We used 10 000 hand-labelled single suicide cases from NVDRS (2010-2018) to train (n=8500) and validate (n=1500) a classification model using supervised machine learning. We used natural language processing to extract relevant information from the death narratives within a concept normalisation framework. We tested numerous models and present performance metrics for the best approach. Results Our final model had robust sensitivity (0.70), specificity (0.98), precision (0.72) and kappa values (0.69). False positives mostly described other family violence. False negatives used vague and heterogeneous language to describe IPV, and often included abusive suicide threats. Implications It is possible to detect IPV circumstances among singles suicides in NVDRS, although vague language in death narratives limited our tool's sensitivity. More attention to the role of IPV in suicide is merited both during the initial death investigation processes and subsequent NVDRS reporting. This tool can support future research to inform targeted prevention.  © 2023 Authors",2023,,Injury Prevention,29,2,134-141,,10.1136/ip-2022-044662,,#648,Kafka 2023,"",""

"Machine-learning analysis of opioid use disorder informed by MOR, DOR, KOR, NOR and ZOR-based interactome networks","Feng, H.; Elladki, R.; Jiang, J.; Wei, G.-W.","Opioid use disorder (OUD) continuously poses major public health challenges and social implications worldwide with dramatic rise of opioid dependence leading to potential abuse. Despite that a few pharmacological agents have been approved for OUD treatment, the efficacy of said agents for OUD requires further improvement in order to provide safer and more effective pharmacological and psychosocial treatments. Proteins including mu, delta, kappa, nociceptin, and zeta opioid receptors are the direct targets of opioids and play critical roles in therapeutic treatments. The protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks of the these receptors increase the complexity in the drug development process for an effective opioid addiction treatment. The report below presents a PPI-network informed machine-learning study of OUD. We have examined more than 500 proteins in the five opioid receptor networks and subsequently collected 74 inhibitor datasets. Machine learning models were constructed by pairing gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) algorithm with two advanced natural language processing (NLP)-based autoencoder and Transformer fingerprints for molecules. With these models, we systematically carried out evaluations of screening and repurposing potential of more than 120,000 drug candidates for four opioid receptors. In addition, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) properties were also considered in the screening of potential drug candidates. Our machine-learning tools determined a few inhibitor compounds with desired potency and ADMET properties for nociceptin opioid receptors. Our approach offers a valuable and promising tool for the pharmacological development of OUD treatments. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2023,,Computers in Biology and Medicine,157,,,,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2023.106745,,#653,Feng 2023,"",""

Detecting Mental Disorders with Wearables: A Large Cohort Study,"Dai, R.; Kannampallil, T.; Kim, S.; Thornton, V.; Bierut, L.; Lu, C.","Depression and anxiety are among the most prevalent mental disorders, and they are usually interconnected. Although these mental disorders have drawn increasing attention due to their tremendous negative impacts on working ability and job performance, over 50% of patients are not recognized or adequately treated. Recent literature has shown the potential of using wearables for expediting the detection of mental health disorders, as physical activities are reported to be related to some mental health disorders. However, most prior studies on mental health with wearables were limited to small cohorts. The feasibility of detecting mental disorders in the community with a large and diverse population remains an open question. In this paper, we study the problem of detecting depression and anxiety disorders with commercial wearable activity trackers based on a public dataset including 8,996 participants and 1,247 diagnosed with mental disorders. The large cohort is highly diverse, spanning a wide spectrum of age, race, ethnicity, and education levels. While prior studies were usually limited to shallow machine learning models and feature engineering to accommodate the small sample sizes, we develop an end-to-end deep model combining a transformer encoder and convolutional neural network to directly learn from daily wearable features and detect mental disorders. WearNet achieves an area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.717 (S.D. 0.009) and an AUPRC of 0.487 (S.D. 0.008) in detecting mental disorders while outperforming traditional and state-of-the-art machine learning models.

We compared anxiety levels in three groups of both HL subscales. Text-mining analyses were also conducted among the three HL groups. Two-Thirds of respondents reported anxiety about COVID-19, and 42% of them also reported fear.

Objective: To investigate associations between veterans' death by suicide and recent SDOHs, identified using structured and unstructured data. Design, Setting, and Participants: This nested case-control study included veterans who received care under the US Veterans Health Administration from October 1, 2010, to September 30, 2015. A natural language processing (NLP) system was developed to extract SDOHs from unstructured clinical notes. Structured data yielded 6 SDOHs (ie, social or familial problems, employment or financial problems, housing instability, legal problems, violence, and nonspecific psychosocial needs), NLP on unstructured data yielded 8 SDOHs (social isolation, job or financial insecurity, housing instability, legal problems, barriers to care, violence, transition of care, and food insecurity), and combining them yielded 9 SDOHs. Data were analyzed in May 2022. Exposures: Occurrence of SDOHs over a maximum span of 2 years compared with no occurrence of SDOH. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cases of suicide death were matched with 4 controls on birth year, cohort entry date, sex, and duration of follow-up. Suicide was ascertained by National Death Index, and patients were followed up for up to 2 years after cohort entry with a study end date of September 30, 2015. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% CIs were estimated using conditional logistic regression. Results: Of 6122785 veterans, 8821 committed suicide during 23725382 person-years of follow-up (incidence rate 37.18 per 100000 person-years). These 8821 veterans were matched with 35284 control participants. The cohort was mostly male (42540 [96.45%]) and White (34930 [79.20%]), with 6227 (14.12%) Black veterans. The mean (SD) age was 58.64 (17.41) years. Across the 5 common SDOHs, NLP-extracted SDOH, on average, retained 49.92% of structured SDOHs and covered 80.03% of all SDOH occurrences. SDOHs, obtained by structured data and/or NLP, were significantly associated with increased risk of suicide. The 3 SDOHs with the largest effect sizes were legal problems (aOR, 2.66; 95% CI, 2.46-2.89), violence (aOR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.98-2.27), and nonspecific psychosocial needs (aOR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.92-2.23), when obtained by combining structured data and NLP.

While initial evidence relates self-reported preferences for broad musical styles to the Big Five dimensions, little is known about day-to-day music listening behavior and the intrinsic attributes of melodies and lyrics that reflect these individual differences. The present study (N = 330) proposes a personality computing approach to fill these gaps with new insights from ecologically valid music listening records from smartphones. We quantified participants' music preferences via audio and lyrics characteristics of their played songs through technical audio features from Spotify and textual attributes obtained via natural language processing. Using linear elastic net and non-linear random forest models, these behavioral variables served to predict Big Five personality on domain and facet levels. Out-of-sample prediction performances revealed that - on the domain level - Openness was most strongly related to music listening (r = .25), followed by Conscientiousness (r = .13), while several facets of the Big Five also showed small to medium effects. Hinting at the incremental value of audio and lyrics characteristics, both musical components were differentially informative for models predicting Openness and its facets, whereas lyrics preferences played the more important role for predictions of Conscientiousness dimensions. In doing so, the models' most predictive variables displayed generally trait-congruent relationships between personality and music preferences. These findings contribute to the development of a cumulative theory on music listening in personality science and may be extended in numerous ways by future work leveraging the computational framework proposed here. © 2023 University of California Press.

SymptomGraph: Identifying Symptom Clusters from Narrative Clinical Notes using Graph Clustering,"Tahabi, F.M.; Storey, S.; Luo, X.","Patients with cancer or other chronic diseases often experience different symptoms before or after treatments. The symptoms could be physical, gastrointestinal, psychological, or cognitive (memory loss), or other types. Previous research focuses on understanding the individual symptoms or symptom correlations by collecting data through symptom surveys and using traditional statistical methods to analyze the symptoms, such as principal component analysis or factor analysis. This research proposes a computational system, SymptomGraph, to identify the symptom clusters in the narrative text of written clinical notes in electronic health records (EHR). SymptomGraph is developed to use a set of natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) methods to first extract the clinician-documented symptoms from clinical notes. Then, a semantic symptom expression clustering method is used to discover a set of typical symptoms. A symptom graph is built based on the co-occurrences of the symptoms. Finally, a graph clustering algorithm is developed to discover the symptom clusters. Although SymptomGraph is applied to the narrative clinical notes, it can be adapted to analyze symptom survey data. We applied Symptom-Graph on a colorectal cancer patient with and without diabetes (Type 2) data set to detect the patient symptom clusters one year after the chemotherapy. Our results show that SymptomGraph can identify the typical symptom clusters of colorectal cancer patients' post-chemotherapy. The results also show that colorectal cancer patients with diabetes often show more symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, younger patients have mental dysfunctions of alcohol or tobacco abuse, and patients at later cancer stages show more memory loss symptoms. Our system can be generalized to extract and analyze symptom clusters of other chronic diseases or acute diseases like COVID-19.  © 2023 ACM.",2023,,Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Applied Computing,,,518-527,,10.1145/3555776.3577685,,#678,Tahabi 2023,"",""
Predicting suicidal and self-injurious events in a correctional setting using AI algorithms on unstructured medical notes and structured data,"Lu, H.; Barrett, A.; Pierce, A.; Zheng, J.; Wang, Y.; Chiang, C.; Rakovski, C.","Suicidal and self-injurious incidents in correctional settings deplete the institutional and healthcare resources, create disorder and stress for staff and other inmates. Traditional statistical analyses provide some guidance, but they can only be applied to structured data that are often difficult to collect and their recommendations are often expensive to act upon. This study aims to extract information from medical and mental health progress notes using AI algorithms to make actionable predictions of suicidal and self-injurious events to improve the efficiency of triage for health care services and prevent suicidal and injurious events from happening at California's Orange County Jails. The results showed that the notes data contain more information with respect to suicidal or injurious behaviors than the structured data available in the EHR database at the Orange County Jails. Using the notes data alone (under-sampled to 50%) in a Transformer Encoder model produced an AUC-ROC of 0.862, a Sensitivity of 0.816, and a Specificity of 0.738. Incorporating the information extracted from the notes data into traditional Machine Learning models as a feature alongside structured data (under-sampled to 50%) yielded better performance in terms of Sensitivity (AUC-ROC: 0.77, Sensitivity: 0.89, Specificity: 0.65). In addition, under-sampling is an effective approach to mitigating the impact of the extremely imbalanced classes. © 2023 The Authors",2023,,Journal of Psychiatric Research,160,,19-27,,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2023.01.032,,#680,Lu 2023,"",""
Using natural language processing to identify child maltreatment in health systems,"Negriff, S.; Lynch, F.L.; Cronkite, D.J.; Pardee, R.E.; Penfold, R.B.","Background: Rates of child maltreatment (CM) obtained from electronic health records are much lower than national child welfare prevalence rates indicate. There is a need to understand how CM is documented to improve reporting and surveillance. Objectives: To examine whether using natural language processing (NLP) in outpatient chart notes can identify cases of CM not documented by ICD diagnosis code, the overlap between the coding of child maltreatment by ICD and NLP, and any differences by age, gender, or race/ethnicity. Methods: Outpatient chart notes of children age 0–18 years old within Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA) 2018–2020 were used to examine a selected set of maltreatment-related terms categorized into concept unique identifiers (CUI). Manual review of text snippets for each CUI was completed to flag for validated cases and retrain the NLP algorithm. Results: The NLP results indicated a crude rate of 1.55 % to 2.36 % (2018–2020) of notes with reference to CM. The rate of CM identified by ICD code was 3.32 per 1000 children, whereas the rate identified by NLP was 37.38 per 1000 children. The groups that increased the most in identification of maltreatment from ICD to NLP were adolescents (13–18 yrs. old), females, Native American children, and those on Medicaid. Of note, all subgroups had substantially higher rates of maltreatment when using NLP. Conclusions: Use of NLP substantially increased the estimated number of children who have been impacted by CM. Accurately capturing this population will improve identification of vulnerable youth at high risk for mental health symptoms. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2023,,Child Abuse and Neglect,138,,,,10.1016/j.chiabu.2023.106090,,#681,Negriff 2023,"",""
AI Assisted Attention Mechanism for Hybrid Neural Model to Assess Online Attitudes About COVID-19,"Kour, H.; Gupta, M.K.","COVID-19 is a novel virus that presents challenges due to a lack of consistent and in-depth research. The news of the COVID-19 spreads across the globe, resulting in a flood of posts on social media sites. Apart from health, social, and economic disturbances brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, another important consequence involves public mental health crises which is of greater concern. Data related to COVID-19 is a valuable asset for researchers in understanding people's feelings related to the pandemic. It is thus important to extract the early information evolving public sentiments on social platforms during the outbreak of COVID-19. The objective of this study is to look at people's perceptions of the COVID-19 pandemic who interact with each other and share tweets on the Twitter platform. COVIDSenti, a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising 90,000 COVID-19 tweets collected from February to March 2020, during the initial phases of the outbreak served as the foundation for our experiments. A pre-trained bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) model is fine-tuned and embeddings generated are combined with two long short-term memory networks to propose the residual encoder transformation network model. The proposed model is used for multiclass text classification on a large dataset labeled as positive, negative, and neutral. The experimental outcomes validate that: (1) the proposed model is the best performing model, with 98% accuracy and 96% F1-score; (2) It also outperforms conventional machine learning algorithms and different variants of BERT, and (3) the approach achieves better results as compared to state-of-the-art on different benchmark datasets. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2023,,Neural Processing Letters,55,3,2265-2304,,10.1007/s11063-022-11112-0,,#683,Kour 2023,"",""
Development of a keyword library for capturing PRO-CTCAE-focused “symptom talk” in oncology conversations,"Durieux, B.N.; Zverev, S.R.; Tarbi, E.C.; Kwok, A.; Sciacca, K.; Pollak, K.I.; Tulsky, J.A.; Lindvall, C.","Objectives: As computational methods for detecting symptoms can help us better attend to patient suffering, the objectives of this study were to develop and evaluate the performance of a natural language processing keyword library for detecting symptom talk, and to describe symptom communication within our dataset to generate insights for future model building. Materials and Methods: This was a secondary analysis of 121 transcribed outpatient oncology conversations from the Communication in Oncologist-Patient Encounters trial. Through an iterative process of identifying symptom expressions via inductive and deductive techniques, we generated a library of keywords relevant to the Patient-Reported Outcome version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) framework from 90 conversations, and tested the library on 31 additional transcripts. To contextualize symptom expressions and the nature of misclassifications, we qualitatively analyzed 450 mislabeled and properly labeled symptom-positive turns. Results: The final library, comprising 1320 terms, identified symptom talk among conversation turns with an F1 of 0.82 against a PRO-CTCAE-focused gold standard, and an F1 of 0.61 against a broad gold standard. Qualitative observations suggest that physical symptoms are more easily detected than psychological symptoms (eg, anxiety), and ambiguity persists throughout symptom communication. Discussion: This rudimentary keyword library captures most PRO-CTCAE-focused symptom talk, but the ambiguity of symptom speech limits the utility of rule-based methods alone, and limits to generalizability must be considered. Conclusion: Our findings highlight opportunities for more advanced computational models to detect symptom expressions from transcribed clinical conversations.

Text Emotion Recognition Based on XLNet-BiGRU-Att,"Han, T.; Zhang, Z.; Ren, M.; Dong, C.; Jiang, X.; Zhuang, Q.","Text emotion recognition (TER) is an important natural language processing (NLP) task which is widely used in human–computer interaction, public opinion analysis, mental health analysis, and social network analysis. In this paper, a deep learning model based on XLNet with bidirectional recurrent unit and attention mechanism (XLNet-BiGRU-Att) is proposed in order to improve TER performance. XLNet is used to build bidirectional language models which can learn contextual information simultaneously, while the bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU) helps to extract more effective features which can pay attention to current and previous states using hidden layers and the attention mechanism (Att) provides different weights to enhance the ’attention’ paid to important information, thereby improving the quality of word vectors and the accuracy of sentiment analysis model judgments.

Experiments on the Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture (IEMOCAP) database and the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Automation (CASIA) dataset were carried out to compare XLNet-BiGRU-Att, XLNet, BERT, and BERT-BiLSTM, and the results show that the model proposed in this paper has superior performance compared to the others. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,,Electronics (Switzerland),12,12,,,10.3390/electronics12122704,,#693,Han 2023,"",""
Identifying Checkworthy CURE Claims on Twitter,"Gollapalli, S.D.; Du, M.; Ng, S.-K.","Medical claims on social media, if left unchecked, have the potential to directly affect the well-being of consumers of online health information.

In this paper, we address these limitations by compiling CW-CURE, a novel dataset of CURE tweets, namely tweets containing claims on prevention, diagnoses, risks, treatments, and cures of medical conditions. CW-CURE contains tweets on four major health conditions, namely, Alzheimer's disease, Cancer, Diabetes, and Depression annotated for claims, their ""checkworthiness"", as well as the different types of claims such as quantitative claim, correlation/causation, personal experience, and future prediction.

Understanding Barriers Along the Patient Journey in Alzheimer’s Disease Using Social Media Data,"Tahami Monfared, A.A.; Stern, Y.; Doogan, S.; Irizarry, M.; Zhang, Q.","Introduction: We speculated that social media data from Alzheimer’s disease (AD) stakeholders (patients, caregivers, and clinicians) could identify barriers along the patient journey in AD, and that insights gained may help devise strategies to remove barriers, and ultimately improve the patient journey. Methods: Our sample was drawn from a repository of social media posts extracted from 112 public sources between January 1998 and December 2021 using natural language processing text-mining algorithms. The patient journey was classified into three phases: (1) early signs/experiences (Early Signs); (2) screening/assessment/diagnosis (Screening); and (3) treatment/management (Treatment). In the Early Signs phase, issues/challenges derived from a conceptual AD identification framework (ADIF) were examined. In subsequent phases, behavioral/psychiatric challenges, access/barriers to health care, screening/diagnostic methods, and symptomatic treatments for AD were identified. Posts were classified by AD stakeholder type or disease stage, if possible. Results: We identified 225,977 AD patient journey-related social media posts. Anxiety was a predominant issue/challenge in all patient journey phases. In the Screening and Treatment phases combined, access/barriers to care were described in 16% of posts; unwillingness/resistance to seeking care was a major barrier (≥ 75% of access-related posts across all stakeholders). Commonly identified structural barriers (e.g., affordability/cost, geography/transportation/distance) were more common in patient/caregiver posts than clinician posts. Among Screening-related posts, imaging/scans were commonly mentioned by all stakeholders; biomarkers were more commonly mentioned by patients than clinicians. Treatment-related concerns were identified in 17% of stakeholder-specified posts that named pharmacological agents/classes for the symptomatic management of AD. Conclusion: This descriptive analysis of out-of-clinic experiences reflected in AD social media posts found that unwillingness/resistance to seeking care was a key barrier, followed by structural barriers to health care, such as affordability/cost. Insights from the lived experiences of AD stakeholders are valuable and highlight the need to improve the patient journey in AD and ease patient and caregiver burden. © 2023, The Author(s).",2023,,Neurology and Therapy,12,3,899-918,,10.1007/s40120-023-00472-x,,#699,TahamiMonfared 2023,"",""
"A year of pandemic: Levels, changes and validity of well-being data from Twitter. Evidence from ten countries","Sarracino, F.; Greyling, T.; O’Connor, K.; Peroni, C.; Rossouw, S.","We use daily happiness scores (Gross National Happiness (GNH)) to illustrate how happiness changed throughout 2020 in ten countries across Europe and the Southern hemisphere. More frequently and regularly available than survey data, the GNH reveals how happiness sharply declined at the onset of the pandemic and lockdown, quickly recovered, and then trended downward throughout much of the year in Europe. GNH is derived by applying sentiment and emotion analysis–based on Natural Language Processing using machine learning algorithms–to Twitter posts (tweets). Using a similar approach, we generate another 11 variables: eight emotions and three new context-specific variables, in particular: trust in national institutions, sadness in relation to loneliness, and fear concerning the economy. Given the novelty of the dataset, we use multiple methods to assess validity. We also assess the correlates of GNH. The results indicate that GNH is negatively correlated with new COVID-19 cases, containment policies, and disgust and positively correlated with staying at home, surprise, and generalised trust. Altogether the analyses indicate tools based on Big Data, such as the GNH, offer relevant data that often fill information gaps and can valuably supplement traditional tools. In this case, the GNH results suggest that both the severity of the pandemic and containment policies negatively correlated with happiness. © 2023 Sarracino et al.

Using Text Mining and Data Visualization Approaches for Investigating Mental Illness from the Perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine,"Lin, W.-L.; Liang, Y.-C.; Chung, K.-H.; Chen, P.-H.; Chang, Y.-C.","Background and Objectives. Anxiety and depressive disorders are the most prevalent mental disorders, and due to the COVID-19 pandemic, more people are suffering from anxiety and depressive disorders, and a considerable fraction of COVID-19 survivors have a variety of persistent neuropsychiatric problems after the initial infection. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) offers a different perspective on mental disorders from Western biomedicine. Effective management of mental disorders has become an increasing concern in recent decades due to the high social and economic costs involved. This study attempts to express and ontologize the relationships between different mental disorders and physical organs from the perspective of TCM, so as to bridge the gap between the unique terminology used in TCM and a medical professional. Materials and Methods. Natural language processing (NLP) is introduced to quantify the importance of different mental disorder descriptions relative to the five depots and two palaces, stomach and gallbladder, through the classical medical text Huangdi Neijing and construct a mental disorder ontology based on the TCM classic text. Results. The results demonstrate that our proposed framework integrates NLP and data visualization, enabling clinicians to gain insights into mental health, in addition to biomedicine. According to the results of the relationship analysis of mental disorders, depots, palaces, and symptoms, the organ/depot most related to mental disorders is the heart, and the two most important emotion factors associated with mental disorders are anger and worry & think. The mental disorders described in TCM are related to more than one organ (depot/palace). Conclusion.

"Dimensional Modeling of Emotions in Text with Appraisal Theories: Corpus Creation, Annotation Reliability, and Prediction","Troiano, E.; Oberländer, L.; Klinger, R.","The most prominent tasks in emotion analysis are to assign emotions to texts and to understand how emotions manifest in language. An important observation for natural language processing is that emotions can be communicated implicitly by referring to events alone, appealing to an empathetic, intersubjective understanding of events, even without explicitly mentioning an emotion name. In psychology, the class of emotion theories known as appraisal theories aims at explaining the link between events and emotions. Appraisals can be formalized as variables that measure a cognitive evaluation by people living through an event that they consider relevant. They include the assessment if an event is novel, if the person considers themselves to be responsible, if it is in line with their own goals, and so forth. Such appraisals explain which emotions are developed based on an event, for example, that a novel situation can induce surprise or one with uncertain consequences could evoke fear. We analyze the suitability of appraisal theories for emotion analysis in text with the goal of understanding if appraisal concepts can reliably be reconstructed by annotators, if they can be predicted by text classifiers, and if appraisal concepts help to identify emotion categories. To achieve that, we compile a corpus by asking people to textually describe events that triggered particular emotions and to disclose their appraisals. Then, we ask readers to reconstruct emotions and appraisals from the text. This set-up allows us to measure if emotions and appraisals can be recovered purely from text and provides a human baseline to judge a model’s performance measures. Our comparison of text classification methods to human annotators shows that both can reliably detect emotions and appraisals with similar performance. Therefore, appraisals constitute an alternative computational emotion analysis paradigm and further improve the categorization of emotions in text with joint models. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics.",2023,,Computational Linguistics,49,1,1-72,,10.1162/coli_a_00461,,#708,Troiano 2023,"",""
An Ensemble Approach for Cyber Bullying: Text Messages and Images,"Bai, Z.S.; Malempati, S.","Text mining (TM) is a domain used to find valuable patterns from various text documents. Cyberbullying is the term used to abuse a person online or offline platform. Nowadays, cyberbullying has become more dangerous to people who are using social networking sites (SNS). Cyberbullying is of many types, such as text messaging, morphed images, videos, Etc. It is a challenging task to prevent this type of abuse of the person in online SNS. Finding accurate text mining patterns gives better results in detecting cyberbullying on any platform. Cyberbullying is developed with the online SNS to send defamatory statements or orally bully other persons, or by using the online forum to abuse in front of SNS users. Deep Learning (DL) is one of the significant domains used to extract and learn the quality features dynamically from the low-level text inclusions. In this scenario, Convolution neural network (CNN) are DL models used to train text data, images, and videos. CNN is a compelling approach to preparing these data types and achieving better text classification. This paper describes the Ensemble model with the integration of Term Frequency (TF)Inverse document frequency (IDF) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) with advanced feature-extracting techniques to classify the bullying text, images, and videos.

Associations of remote mental healthcare with clinical outcomes: A natural language processing enriched electronic health record data study protocol,"Ahmed, M.S.; Kornblum, D.; Oliver, D.; Fusar-Poli, P.; Patel, R.","Introduction People often experience significant difficulties in receiving mental healthcare due to insufficient resources, stigma and lack of access to care. Remote care technology has the potential to overcome these barriers by reducing travel time and increasing frequency of contact with patients. However, the safe delivery of remote mental healthcare requires evidence on which aspects of care are suitable for remote delivery and which are better served by in-person care. We aim to investigate clinical and demographic associations with remote mental healthcare in a large electronic health record (EHR) dataset and the degree to which remote care is associated with differences in clinical outcomes using natural language processing (NLP) derived EHR data. Methods and analysis Deidentified EHR data, derived from the South London and Maudsley (SLaM) National Health Service Foundation Trust Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) Case Register, will be extracted using the Clinical Record Interactive Search tool for all patients receiving mental healthcare between 1 January 2019 and 31 March 2022. First, data on a retrospective, longitudinal cohort of around 80 000 patients will be analysed using descriptive statistics to investigate clinical and demographic associations with remote mental healthcare and multivariable Cox regression to compare clinical outcomes of remote versus in-person assessments. Second, NLP models that have been previously developed to extract mental health symptom data will be applied to around 5 million documents to analyse the variation in content of remote versus in-person assessments.

Joint modelling of audio-visual cues using attention mechanisms for emotion recognition,"Ghaleb, E.; Niehues, J.; Asteriadis, S.","Emotions play a crucial role in human-human communications with complex socio-psychological nature. In order to enhance emotion communication in human-computer interaction, this paper studies emotion recognition from audio and visual signals in video clips, utilizing facial expressions and vocal utterances. Thereby, the study aims to exploit temporal information of audio-visual cues and detect their informative time segments. Attention mechanisms are used to exploit the importance of each modality over time. We propose a novel framework that consists of bi-modal time windows spanning short video clips labeled with discrete emotions. The framework employs two networks, with each one being dedicated to one modality. As input to a modality-specific network, we consider a time-dependent signal deriving from the embeddings of the video and audio modalities. We employ the encoder part of the Transformer on the visual embeddings and another one on the audio embeddings. The research in this paper introduces detailed studies and meta-analysis findings, linking the outputs of our proposition to research from psychology. Specifically, it presents a framework to understand underlying principles of emotion recognition as functions of three separate setups in terms of modalities: audio only, video only, and the fusion of audio and video. Experimental results on two datasets show that the proposed framework achieves improved accuracy in emotion recognition, compared to state-of-the-art techniques and baseline methods not using attention mechanisms. The proposed method improves the results over baseline methods by at least 5.4%. Our experiments show that attention mechanisms reduce the gap between the entropies of unimodal predictions, which increases the bimodal predictions’ certainty and, therefore, improves the bimodal recognition rates. Furthermore, evaluations with noisy data in different scenarios are presented during the training and testing processes to check the framework’s consistency and the attention mechanism’s behavior. The results demonstrate that attention mechanisms increase the framework’s robustness when exposed to similar conditions during the training and the testing phases. Finally, we present comprehensive evaluations of emotion recognition as a function of time. The study shows that the middle time segments of a video clip are essential in the case of using audio modality. However, in the case of video modality, the importance of time windows is distributed equally. © 2022, The Author(s).",2023,,Multimedia Tools and Applications,82,8,11239-11264,,10.1007/s11042-022-13557-w,,#746,Ghaleb 2023,"",""
Using GPT-3 to Build a Lexicon of Drugs of Abuse Synonyms for Social Media Pharmacovigilance,"Carpenter, K.A.; Altman, R.B.","Drug abuse is a serious problem in the United States, with over 90,000 drug overdose deaths nationally in 2020. A key step in combating drug abuse is detecting, monitoring, and characterizing its trends over time and location, also known as pharmacovigilance.

Social-media-based pharmacovigilance has zero latency, is easily accessible and unfiltered, and benefits from drug users being willing to share their experiences online pseudo-anonymously. However, unlike highly structured official data sources, social media text is rife with misspellings and slang, making automated analysis difficult. Generative Pretrained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) is a large autoregressive language model specialized for few-shot learning that was trained on text from the entire internet. We demonstrate that GPT-3 can be used to generate slang and common misspellings of terms for drugs of abuse. We repeatedly queried GPT-3 for synonyms of drugs of abuse and filtered the generated terms using automated Google searches and cross-references to known drug names. When generated terms for alprazolam were manually labeled, we found that our method produced 269 synonyms for alprazolam, 221 of which were new discoveries not included in an existing drug lexicon for social media. We repeated this process for 98 drugs of abuse, of which 22 are widely-discussed drugs of abuse, building a lexicon of colloquial drug synonyms that can be used for pharmacovigilance on social media. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,,Biomolecules,13,2,,,10.3390/biom13020387,,#750,Carpenter 2023,"",""
Integrating audio and visual modalities for multimodal personality trait recognition via hybrid deep learning,"Zhao, X.; Liao, Y.; Tang, Z.; Xu, Y.; Tao, X.; Wang, D.; Wang, G.; Lu, H.","Recently, personality trait recognition, which aims to identify people’s first impression behavior data and analyze people’s psychological characteristics, has been an interesting and active topic in psychology, affective neuroscience and artificial intelligence. To effectively take advantage of spatio-temporal cues in audio-visual modalities, this paper proposes a new method of multimodal personality trait recognition integrating audio-visual modalities based on a hybrid deep learning framework, which is comprised of convolutional neural networks (CNN), bi-directional long short-term memory network (Bi-LSTM), and the Transformer network. In particular, a pre-trained deep audio CNN model is used to learn high-level segment-level audio features. A pre-trained deep face CNN model is leveraged to separately learn high-level frame-level global scene features and local face features from each frame in dynamic video sequences. Then, these extracted deep audio-visual features are fed into a Bi-LSTM and a Transformer network to individually capture long-term temporal dependency, thereby producing the final global audio and visual features for downstream tasks. Finally, a linear regression method is employed to conduct the single audio-based and visual-based personality trait recognition tasks, followed by a decision-level fusion strategy used for producing the final Big-Five personality scores and interview scores. Experimental results on the public ChaLearn First Impression-V2 personality dataset show the effectiveness of our method, outperforming other used methods.

Playing and Socializing—Adults’ Perceptions of the FIFA Digital Game,"Pinheiro, A.; Oliveira, A.; Alturas, B.","Gamers’ perceptions of using competitive digital games, especially concerning anxiety and socialization, have raised doubts about the benefits of playing such games. Since different studies highlight different results, this research aims to explore these differences by analyzing the perceptions of adults involved in playing a competitive digital game, in this case, FIFA, considering data that were collected during the COVID-19 pandemic period. The main question is ‘How do adults perceive anxiety, stress, and socialization when playing the FIFA digital game?’. The research comprises two studies involving volunteer participants: In the first part, which adopts a qualitative approach, the participants’ perceptions of what they think and feel when playing FIFA were analyzed and interpreted using text mining analysis. In the second, a quantitative study, FIFA users’ perceptions of the gaming experience were statistically analyzed. The results show that adult users tend to refer to positive perceived stress and socialization. The fact that participants identified manipulations and interference in the game and no longer allowed its use to influence their mood reveals that perceptions of attacks of rage were considered possible reactions to the use of the game, interpreted from the interface, and leading to the creation of knowledge. © 2022 by the authors.",2023,,Informatics,10,1,,,10.3390/informatics10010002,,#761,Pinheiro 2023,"",""
Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Japan: Applying Topic Modeling in Daily Life Descriptions,"Chishima, Y.; Liu, I.-T.H.-C.","The novel coronavirus disease pandemic is threatening not only physical but also mental health.

Initial antidepressant choice by non-psychiatrists: Learning from large-scale electronic health records,"Sheu, Y.-H.; Magdamo, C.; Miller, M.; Smoller, J.W.; Blacker, D.","Objectives: Pharmacological treatment of depression mostly occurs in non-psychiatric settings, but the determinants of initial choice of antidepressant treatment in these settings are unclear. We investigate how non-psychiatrists choose among four antidepressant classes at first prescription (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRI], bupropion, mirtazapine, or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors [SNRI]). Method: Using electronic health records (EHRs), we included adult patients at the time of first antidepressant prescription with a co-occurring diagnosis code for a depressive disorder. We selected 64 variables based on a literature search and expert consultation, constructed the variables from either structured codes or through applying natural language processing (NLP), and modeled antidepressant choice using multinomial logistic regression, using SSRI as the reference class. Results: With 47,528 patients, we observed significant associations for 36 of 64 variables. Many of these associations suggested antidepressants' known pharmacological properties/actions guided choice. For example, there was a decreased likelihood of bupropion prescription among patients with epilepsy (adjusted OR 0.49, 95%CI: 0.41–0.57, p < 0.001), and an increased likelihood of mirtazapine prescription among patients with insomnia (adjusted OR 1.59, 95%CI: 1.40–1.80, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Broadly speaking, non-psychiatrists' selection of antidepressant class appears to be at least in part guided by clinically relevant pharmacological considerations. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",2023,,General Hospital Psychiatry,81,,22-31,,10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2022.12.004,,#771,Sheu 2023,"",""
Identifying women with postdelivery posttraumatic stress disorder using natural language processing of personal childbirth narratives,"Bartal, A.; Jagodnik, K.M.; Chan, S.J.; Babu, M.S.; Dekel, S.","BACKGROUND: Maternal mental disorders are considered a leading complication of childbirth and a common contributor to maternal death. In addition to undermining maternal welfare, untreated postpartum psychopathology can result in child emotional and physical neglect and associated significant pediatric health costs. Some women may experience traumatic childbirth and develop posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms after delivery (childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder). Although women are routinely screened for postpartum depression in the United States, there is no recommended protocol to inform the identification of women who are likely to experience childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder. Advancements in computational methods of free text have shown promise in informing the diagnosis of psychiatric conditions. Although the language in narratives of stressful events has been associated with posttrauma outcomes, whether the narratives of childbirth processed via machine learning can be useful for childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder screening is unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the use of written narrative accounts of personal childbirth experiences for the identification of women with childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder. To this end, we developed a model based on natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to identify childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder via the classification of birth narratives. STUDY DESIGN: Overall, 1127 eligible postpartum women who enrolled in a study survey during the COVID-19 pandemic provided short written childbirth narrative accounts in which they were instructed to focus on the most distressing aspects of their childbirth experience. They also completed a posttraumatic stress disorder symptom screen to determine childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder. After the exclusion criteria were applied, data from 995 participants were analyzed. A machine learning-based Sentence-Transformers natural language processing model was used to represent narratives as vectors that served as inputs for a neural network machine learning model developed in this study to identify participants with childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder. RESULTS: The machine learning model derived from natural language processing of childbirth narratives achieved good performance (area under the curve, 0.75; F1 score, 0.76; sensitivity, 0.8; specificity, 0.70). Moreover, women with childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder generated longer narratives (t test results: t=2.30; p=.02) and used more negative emotional expressions (Wilcoxon test: sadness: p=8.90e-04; W=31,017; anger: p=1.32e-02; W=35,005.50) and death-related words (Wilcoxon test: p=3.48e-05; W=34,538) in describing their childbirth experience than those with no childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder. CONCLUSION: This study provided proof of concept that personal childbirth narrative accounts generated in the early postpartum period and analyzed via advanced computational methods can detect with relatively high accuracy women who are likely to endorse childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder and those at low risk. This suggests that birth narratives could be promising for informing low-cost, noninvasive tools for maternal mental health screening, and more research that used machine learning to predict early signs of maternal psychiatric morbidity is warranted. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",2023,,American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology MFM,5,3,,,10.1016/j.ajogmf.2022.100834,,#772,Bartal 2023,"",""
Mental Health Diagnoses are Not Associated With Indicators of Lower Quality Pain Care in Electronic Health Records of a National Sample of Veterans Treated in Veterans Health Administration Primary Care Settings,"Dobscha, S.K.; Luther, S.L.; Kerns, R.D.; Finch, D.K.; Goulet, J.L.; Brandt, C.A.; Skanderson, M.; Bathulapalli, H.; Fodeh, S.J.; Hahm, B.; Bouayad, L.; Lee, A.; Han, L.","Prior research has demonstrated disparities in general medical care for patients with mental health conditions, but little is known about disparities in pain care. The objective of this retrospective cohort study was to determine whether mental health conditions are associated with indicators of pain care quality (PCQ) as documented by primary care clinicians in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). We used natural language processing to analyze electronic health record data from a national sample of Veterans with moderate to severe musculoskeletal pain during primary care visits in the Fiscal Year 2017. Twelve PCQ indicators were annotated from clinician progress notes as present or absent; PCQ score was defined as the sum of these indicators. Generalized estimating equation Poisson models examined associations among mental health diagnosis categories and PCQ scores. The overall mean PCQ score across 135,408 person-visits was 8.4 (SD = 2.3). In the final adjusted model, post-traumatic stress disorder was associated with higher PCQ scores (RR = 1.006, 95%CI 1.002–1.010, P = .007). Depression, alcohol use disorder, other substance use disorder, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder diagnoses were not associated with PCQ scores. Overall, results suggest that in this patient population, presence of a mental health condition is not associated with lower quality pain care.

In this workshop, we identified some of the challenges to be addressed in developing and implementing NLP markers-based Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs) in psychiatric practice, especially with respect to psychosis. Of note, a CDSS is meant to enhance decision-making by clinicians by providing additional relevant information primarily through software (although CDSSs are not without risks). In psychiatry, a field that relies on subjective clinical ratings that condense rich temporal behavioral information, the inclusion of computational quantitative NLP markers can plausibly lead to operationalized decision models in place of idiosyncratic ones, although ethical issues must always be paramount. © 2023 The Author(s).

"Entertain Me Well: An Entertaining, Tailorable, Online Platform Delivering CBT for Depression","Weaver, A.; Zhang, A.; Xiang, X.; Felsman, P.; Fischer, D.J.; Himle, J.A.","Depression prevalence is high, impacting approximately 20% of Americans during their lifetime, and on the rise due to stress and loss associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the high prevalence of depression, unacceptable treatment access disparities persist. When depression goes untreated, it leads to substantial negative impacts in multiple life domains. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), the gold-standard psychosocial treatment for depression, remains largely unavailable to individuals living with depression, particularly individuals who are members of underrepresented groups in our society. Digital mental health interventions (DMHI) have led to important advances in extending the reach of CBT for depression; however, they are underutilized and treatment engagement remains low. We sought to address some of the current gaps in DMHI by developing an online platform for delivering CBT for depression that is entertaining, simple and straightforward, and tailorable. First, this article introduces our online platform, Entertain Me Well (EMW) and its key innovations, including the use of an engaging, character-driven storyline presented as “episodes” within each session, as well as customizable content that allows for tailoring of text, images, and examples to create content most relevant to the target client population, context, or setting. Next, we describe two EMW depression treatment programs that have been tailored: one for delivery in the rural church setting, called Raising Our Spirits Together, and one tailored for delivery in dialysis centers, called Doing Better on Dialysis. Finally, we discuss future directions for the EMW platform, including the ability to create programs for other common mental health and health conditions, the development of additional character-driven storylines with greater treatment personalization, translation of content in multiple languages, and the use of additional technological innovation, such as artificial intelligence like natural language processing, to enhance platform interactivity. © 2023",2023,,Cognitive and Behavioral Practice,30,1,96-115,,10.1016/j.cbpra.2021.09.003,,#788,Weaver 2023,"",""
Evaluation of a Model to Target High-risk Psychiatric Inpatients for an Intensive Postdischarge Suicide Prevention Intervention,"Kessler, R.C.; Bauer, M.S.; Bishop, T.M.; Bossarte, R.M.; Castro, V.M.; Demler, O.V.; Gildea, S.M.; Goulet, J.L.; King, A.J.; Kennedy, C.J.; Landes, S.J.; Liu, H.; Luedtke, A.; Mair, P.; Marx, B.P.; Nock, M.K.; Petukhova, M.V.; Pigeon, W.R.; Sampson, N.A.; Smoller, J.W.; Miller, A.; Haas, G.; Benware, J.; Bradley, J.; Owen, R.R.; House, S.; Urosevic, S.; Weinstock, L.M.","Importance: The months after psychiatric hospital discharge are a time of high risk for suicide. Intensive postdischarge case management, although potentially effective in suicide prevention, is likely to be cost-effective only if targeted at high-risk patients. A previously developed machine learning (ML) model showed that postdischarge suicides can be predicted from electronic health records and geospatial data, but it is unknown if prediction could be improved by adding additional information. Objective: To determine whether model prediction could be improved by adding information extracted from clinical notes and public records. Design, Setting, and Participants: Models were trained to predict suicides in the 12 months after Veterans Health Administration (VHA) short-term (less than 365 days) psychiatric hospitalizations between the beginning of 2010 and September 1, 2012 (299050 hospitalizations, with 916 hospitalizations followed within 12 months by suicides) and tested in the hospitalizations from September 2, 2012, to December 31, 2013 (149738 hospitalizations, with 393 hospitalizations followed within 12 months by suicides). Validation focused on net benefit across a range of plausible decision thresholds. Predictor importance was assessed with Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) values. Data were analyzed from January to August 2022. Main Outcomes and Measures: Suicides were defined by the National Death Index. Base model predictors included VHA electronic health records and patient residential data. The expanded predictors came from natural language processing (NLP) of clinical notes and a social determinants of health (SDOH) public records database. Results: The model included 448788 unique hospitalizations. Net benefit over risk horizons between 3 and 12 months was generally highest for the model that included both NLP and SDOH predictors (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve range, 0.747-0.780; area under the precision recall curve relative to the suicide rate range, 3.87-5.75). NLP and SDOH predictors also had the highest predictor class-level SHAP values (proportional SHAP = 64.0% and 49.3%, respectively), although the single highest positive variable-level SHAP value was for a count of medications classified by the US Food and Drug Administration as increasing suicide risk prescribed the year before hospitalization (proportional SHAP = 15.0%). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, clinical notes and public records were found to improve ML model prediction of suicide after psychiatric hospitalization. The model had positive net benefit over 3-month to 12-month risk horizons for plausible decision thresholds. Although caution is needed in inferring causality based on predictor importance, several key predictors have potential intervention implications that should be investigated in future studies.. © 2023 American Medical Association.

Classification and analysis of text transcription from Thai depression assessment tasks among patients with depression,"Munthuli, A.; Pooprasert, P.; Klangpornkun, N.; Phienphanich, P.; Onsuwan, C.; Jaisin, K.; Pattanaseri, K.; Lortrakul, J.; Tantibundhit, C.","Depression is a serious mental health disorder that poses a major public health concern in Thailand and have a profound impact on individuals’ physical and mental health. In addition, the lack of number to mental health services and limited number of psychiatrists in Thailand make depression particularly challenging to diagnose and treat, leaving many individuals with the condition untreated. Recent studies have explored the use of natural language processing to enable access to the classification of depression, particularly with a trend toward transfer learning from pre-trained language model. In this study, we attempted to evaluate the effectiveness of using XLM-RoBERTa, a pre-trained multi-lingual language model supporting the Thai language, for the classification of depression from a limited set of text transcripts from speech responses. Twelve Thai depression assessment questions were developed to collect text transcripts of speech responses to be used with XLM-RoBERTa in transfer learning. The results of transfer learning with text transcription from speech responses of 80 participants (40 with depression and 40 normal control) showed that when only one question (Q1) of “How are you these days?” was used, the recall, precision, specificity, and accuracy were 82.5%, 84.65, 85.00, and 83.75%, respectively. When utilizing the first three questions from Thai depression assessment tasks (Q1 − Q3), the values increased to 87.50%, 92.11%, 92.50%, and 90.00%, respectively. The local interpretable model explanations were analyzed to determine which words contributed the most to the model’s word cloud visualization. Our findings were consistent with previously published literature and provide similar explanation for clinical settings. It was discovered that the classification model for individuals with depression relied heavily on negative terms such as ‘not,’ ‘sad,’, ‘mood’, ‘suicide’, ‘bad’, and ‘bore’ whereas normal control participants used neutral to positive terms such as ‘recently,’ ‘fine,’, ‘normally’, ‘work’, and ‘working’. The findings of the study suggest that screening for depression can be facilitated by eliciting just three questions from patients with depression, making the process more accessible and less time-consuming while reducing the already huge burden on healthcare workers.

Word embedding for mixed-emotions analysis,"MohammadiBaghmolaei, R.; Ahmadi, A.","Word embedding is the process of converting words into vectors of real numbers which is of great interest in natural language processing. Recently, the performance of word embedding models has been the subject of some studies in emotion analysis.

The underlying emotion models in the existing studies follow basic emotion theories in psychology such as Plutchik or VAD. However, none of them investigate the Mixed Emotions (ME) model in their work which is the most precise theory of emotions raised in the recent psychological studies. According to ME, feelings can be the consequent of multiple emotion categories at the same time with different intensities. Relying on the ME model, this article embeds mixed emotions features into the existing word-vectors and performs extensive experiments on various English datasets.

Backdoor Adjustment of Confounding by Provenance for Robust Text Classification of Multi-institutional Clinical Notes,"Ding, X.; Sheng, Z.; Yetişgen, M.; Pakhomov, S.; Cohen, T.","Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods have been broadly applied to clinical tasks. Machine learning and deep learning approaches have been used to improve the performance of clinical NLP. However, these approaches require sufficiently large datasets for training, and trained models have been shown to transfer poorly across sites. These issues have led to the promotion of data collection and integration across different institutions for accurate and portable models. However, this can introduce a form of bias called confounding by provenance. When source-specific data distributions differ at deployment, this may harm model performance. To address this issue, we evaluate the utility of backdoor adjustment for text classification in a multi-site dataset of clinical notes annotated for mentions of substance abuse. Using an evaluation framework devised to measure robustness to distributional shifts, we assess the utility of backdoor adjustment. Our results indicate that backdoor adjustment can effectively mitigate for confounding shift. ©2023 AMIA - All rights reserved.",2023,,AMIA ... Annual Symposium proceedings.

We incorporate both contextual and non-contextual embeddings, which are trained not just on general domain data but also on data specific to the clinical domain. Our findings indicate that the bias in embeddings is towards different gender groups, depending on the type of embeddings and the training dataset. Furthermore, we highlight how these existing associations transfer to subsequent tasks and might even be amplified during supervised training for patient phenotyping.

Detecting Reddit Users with Depression Using a Hybrid Neural Network SBERT-CNN,"Chen, Z.; Yang, R.; Fu, S.; Zong, N.; Liu, H.; Huang, M.","Depression is a widespread mental health issue, affecting an estimated 3.8% of the global population. It is also one of the main contributors to disability worldwide. Recently it is becoming popular for individuals to use social media platforms (e.g., Reddit) to express their difficulties and health issues (e.g., depression) and seek support from other users in online communities. It opens great opportunities to automatically identify social media users with depression by parsing millions of posts for potential interventions. Deep learning methods have begun to dominate in the field of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) because of their ease of use, efficient processing, and state-of-the-art results on many NLP tasks. In this work, we propose a hybrid deep learning model (SBERT-CNN) which combines a pretrained sentence BERT (SBERT) and convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect individuals with depression with their Reddit posts. The sentence BERT is used to learn the meaningful representation of semantic information in each post. CNN enables the further transformation of those embeddings and the temporal identification of behavioral patterns of users. We trained and evaluated the model performance to identify Reddit users with depression by utilizing the Self-reported Mental Health Diagnoses (SMHD) data. The SBERT-CNN model achieved an accuracy of 0.86 and an F1 score of 0.86 and outperformed the state-of-the-art documented result (F1 score of 0.79) by other machine learning models in the literature. The results show the feasibility of the hybrid SBERT-CNN model to identify individuals with depression. Although the hybrid model is validated to detect depression with Reddit posts, it can be easily tuned and applied to other text classification tasks and different clinical applications. © 2023 IEEE.",2023,,"Proceedings - 2023 IEEE 11th International Conference on Healthcare Informatics, ICHI 2023",,,193-199,,10.1109/ICHI57859.2023.00035,,#825,Chen 2023,"",""

The results show that the accuracy of the dataset processed by the T-GAN model has been improved on LGBT, KNN, SVM, and RoBERTa, proving that the campus network public opinion analysis model based on the T-GAN model helps to automatically identify campus network public opinion, protect students’ physical and mental health, and promote the healthy development of the campus network environment. © 2023, Science and Information Organization.

Using a self-attention architecture to automate valence categorization of French teenagers’ free descriptions of their family relationships: a proof of concept,"Sedki, M.; Vidal, N.; Roux, P.; Barry, C.; Speranza, M.; Falissard, B.; Brunet-Gouet, E.","Background: When caring for adolescents with mental health problems, family relationships need to be taken into account, whether they are considered supportive or unfavorable by the patients themselves. Recendevelopments in automated natural language processing (NLP) appear to offer solutions to the challenge odesigning tools to evaluate the spontaneous discourse of adolescents on the subject of these relationshipsThis paper proposes a proof of concept of using NLP to categorize valence of family relationships described in free texts written by French teenagers. The proposed study traces the evolution of techniques for word embedding from classical categorization methods to self-attentional architectures. Methods: After decomposing different texts in our possession into short texts composed of sentences and manual labeling, we tested different word embedding scenarios to train a multi-label classification model where a text can take several labels: labels describing the family link between the teenager and the person mentioned in the text and labels describing the teenager’s relationship with them (positive/negative/neutral valence). The natural baseline for word vector representation of our texts is to build a Term Frequency-Inverse-Document-Frequency (TF-IDF) and train classical classifiers (Elasticnet logistic regression, gradient boosting, random forest, support vector classifier) after selecting a model by cross validation in each class of machine learning models. We then studied the strengths of word-vectors embeddings by an advanced language representation technique via the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) CamemBERT transformer model, and, again, used them with classical classifiers to compare their respective performancesThe last scenario consisted in augmenting the CamemBERT with output dense layers (perceptron) representing a classifier adapted to the multi-label classification and fine-tuning the CamemBERT original layers. Results: The optimal fine-tuning depth that achieved a bias-variance trade-off was obtained by a cross-validation procedure. The results of the comparison of the three scenarios on a test dataset showed a clear improvement of the classification performances of the scenario with fine-tuning beyond the baseline and of a simple vectorization using CamemBERT without fine-tuning. Conclusions: Despite the moderate size of the dataset and the input texts, fine-tuning to an optimal depth remains the best solution to build a classifier. © Journal of Medical Artificial Intelligence.

Automatic Detection in Twitter of Non-Traumatic Grief Due to Deaths by COVID-19: A Deep Learning Approach,"Mata-Vazquez, J.; Pachon-Alvarez, V.; Gualda, E.; Araujo-Hernandez, M.; Garcia-Navarro, E.B.","Non-traumatic grief can be defined as, a complex process that includes emotional, physical, spiritual, social, and intellectual behaviors and responses through which individuals, families, and communities incorporate actual, anticipated, or perceived loss into their daily lives. In the age of widespread social media usage, individuals frequently share their emotions online for various reasons. This was particularly evident during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath, where many social media interactions replaced or supplemented traditional farewell and mourning practices, including communications related to deaths. Recognizing messages expressing non-traumatic grief is a crucial challenge for nursing, medicine, and socio-health interventions. This awareness could assist specialists in improving early prevention and healthcare measures. In this work we present an approach to automatically detect messages (tweets) containing non-traumatic grief by means of deep learning techniques. To this end, a corpus of Spanish-language tweets has been built using a binary label to indicate the presence or absence of non-traumatic grief and has been released for use in future research. To address this challenge, multiple monolingual and multilingual language models based on pre-trained Transformer models have been fine-tuned, performing an exhaustive search to obtain the best hyperparameter values. Through this approach and employing various oversampling and undersampling techniques to mitigate the dataset's imbalance issue, the trained models reached very good results on different evaluation metrics, achieving an accuracy, AUC-ROC, and F-measure of 0.850, 0.836, and 0.827, respectively. Our results show the significance of hyperparameter selection during the learning process and demonstrate the potential of deep learning approaches for detecting non-traumatic grief messages. © 2013 IEEE.",2023,,IEEE Access,11,,143402-143416,,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3343149,,#925,Mata-Vazquez 2023,"",""
Preventing Cyberbullying on Social Networks with Spanish Parental Control NLP System,"León-Paredes, G.A.; Bravo-Quezada, O.G.; Bermeo-Aguaysa, P.P.; Peláez-Currillo, M.J.; Jiménez-González, L.L.","The boom in social networks and digital communication has given place to innovative forms of social interaction. However, it has also made possible new forms of harassment of others anonymously and without repercussions. Such is the case of cyberbullying, an increasingly common problem, especially among young people. Its effects on individuals can be devastating, ranging from anxiety and depression to social isolation and low self-esteem. Furthermore, there is a wide variety of applications called parental control, which allow parents to show, the pages the child or adolescent has accessed, know how often the child or adolescent accesses them, and control the time spent on social networks or other entertainment platforms. Therefore, the present research aimed to analyze, design, and implement an intelligent application based on data mining algorithms and the Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) method for the presumed detection of cyberbullying in social networks in adolescents. The methodological process of the study was carried out following the fundamentals of applied research with a qualitative-quantitative descriptive, and cross-sectional approach. As a result, a multiplatform application was obtained that alerts about suspected bullying to parents or guardians. For the validation of the application, the technique of expert judgment was applied. Also, the process of obtaining negative and positive text similarity was performed based on cosine similarity. In the analysis of Twitter accounts, values of 46% with negative texts and 6.71% with positive texts are obtained, which allows inferring that this is a presumed case of cyberbullying in this account. © (2023), (Science and Information Organization).

Toward explainable AI (XAI) for mental health detection based on language behavior,"Kerz, E.; Zanwar, S.; Qiao, Y.; Wiechmann, D.","Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) in general and Natural Language Processing (NLP) in particular are paving the new way forward for the automated detection and prediction of mental health disorders among the population. Recent research in this area has prioritized predictive accuracy over model interpretability by relying on deep learning methods. However, prioritizing predictive accuracy over model interpretability can result in a lack of transparency in the decision-making process, which is critical in sensitive applications such as healthcare. There is thus a growing need for explainable AI (XAI) approaches to psychiatric diagnosis and prediction. The main aim of this work is to address a gap by conducting a systematic investigation of XAI approaches in the realm of automatic detection of mental disorders from language behavior leveraging textual data from social media. In pursuit of this aim, we perform extensive experiments to evaluate the balance between accuracy and interpretability across predictive mental health models. More specifically, we build BiLSTM models trained on a comprehensive set of human-interpretable features, encompassing syntactic complexity, lexical sophistication, readability, cohesion, stylistics, as well as topics and sentiment/emotions derived from lexicon-based dictionaries to capture multiple dimensions of language production. We conduct extensive feature ablation experiments to determine the most informative feature groups associated with specific mental health conditions. We juxtapose the performance of these models against a “black-box” domain-specific pretrained transformer adapted for mental health applications. To enhance the interpretability of the transformers models, we utilize a multi-task fusion learning framework infusing information from two relevant domains (emotion and personality traits). Moreover, we employ two distinct explanation techniques: the local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) method and a model-specific self-explaining method (AGRAD). These methods allow us to discern the specific categories of words that the information-infused models rely on when generating predictions. Our proposed approaches are evaluated on two public English benchmark datasets, subsuming five mental health conditions (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression and psychological stress).

"Crosstalk between short- and long-term calorie restriction transcriptomic signatures with anxiety-like behavior, aging, and neurodegeneration: implications for drug repurposing","Hazi, A.; Ebrahimie, E.; Levay, E.A.; Mohammadi-Dehcheshmeh, M.; Zelko, M.; Govic, A.; Nasser, H.","Calorie restriction (CR) is considered an effective intervention for anxiety, aging, and obesity. We investigated the effects of short- and long-term CR on behavior as well as transcriptome profiles in the hypothalamus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex, pituitary, and adrenal glands of Hooded Wistar and Long Evans male rats. A reduction in anxiety-like behavior, as assessed via the elevated plus maze, was observed in both short- and long-term CR. Despite this, short- and long-term CR regulated different sets of genes, leading to distinct transcriptomic signatures. The employed models were able to simultaneously analyze categorical and numerical variables, evaluating the effect of tissue type along with expression data. In all tissues, transcription factors, zinc finger protein 45-like and zinc finger BTB domain-containing two, were the top selected genes by the models in short and long-term CR treatments, respectively. Text mining identified associations between genes of the short-term CR signature and neurodegeneration, stress, and obesity and between genes of the long-term signature and the nervous system. Literature mining-based drug repurposing showed that alongside known CR mimetics such as resveratrol and rapamycin, candidates not typically associated with CR mimetics may be repurposed based on their interaction with transcriptomic signatures of CR. This study goes some way to unravelling the global effects of CR and opens new avenues for treatment for emotional disorders, neurodegeneration, and obesity.

From Stigma to Support: A Parallel Monolingual Corpus and NLP Approach for Neutralizing Mental Illness Bias,"Choey, M.","Negative attitudes and perceptions towards mental illness continue to be pervasive in our society. One of the factors contributing to and reinforcing this stigma is the usage of language that is biased against mental illness. Identifying biased language and replacing it with person-first, neutralized language is a first step towards eliminating harmful stereotypes and creating a supportive and inclusive environment for those living with mental illness. This paper presents a novel Natural Language Processing (NLP) system that aims to automatically identify biased text related to mental illness and suggest neutral language replacements without altering the original text's meaning. Building on previous work in the field, this paper presents the Mental Illness Neutrality Corpus (MINC) comprising over 5500 mental illnessbiased text and neutralized sentence pairs (in English), which is used to fine-tune a CONCURRENT model system developed by Pryzant et al. (2020). After evaluation, the model demonstrates high proficiency in neutralizing mental illness bias with an accuracy of 98.7%.

Pre- and Post-Depressive Detection using Deep Learning and Textual-based Features,"Tey, W.-L.; Goh, H.-N.; Lim, A.H.-L.; Phang, C.-K.","The rise of mental disorders, specifically depression, has shown an upward trend, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous studies have suggested that it is feasible to learn the textual and behavioral features of a user to identify depression on social media. This paper highlights three new contributions, which are, firstly, to introduce Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) as the survey-based method to complement the TWINT API to collect Twitter data. Secondly, it is to propose a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)- based model, along with emoji decoding and PHQ-9-based lexicon features for predicting the likelihood that a user will exhibit depressive symptoms. The results are promising, achieving an F1 score of 0.98 on a baseline dataset and an F1 score of 0.90 on a benchmark dataset, outperforming previous researcher’s work of achieving a F1 score of 0.85 using solely textual features. Thirdly, previous researcher’s work focuses on differentiating between depressed and non-depressed users only, while this paper further separates the users in the depressive class into before (pre-) and after (post-) self-reported diagnosis, which can potentially be used to detect early symptoms of depression. It was found that the top TF-IDF scores of the post-depressive class contain more frequently negatively implied words compared to the pre-depressive class. © (2023), (Faculty of Engineering, Universitas Indonesia).

Workers’ perceptions of mHealth services for physical activity and mental health: A qualitative study using a text-mining method,"Watanabe, K.; Tsutsumi, A.","Objectives: This study explored the perceptions of workers regarding mobile health (mHealth) services for physical activity and mental health. Methods: Single, online, one-on-one, 60-minute semi-structured interviews were conducted with workers living or working in Tokyo, Japan. The transcribed text corpus of the interviews was used as data to explore their perceptions. The top 200 nouns in the utterances were extracted and modeled using a bag of words (BoW) and embedded into a two-dimensional space. Results: The interviews extracted 476 utterances with 1,294 nouns from the 12 workers (7 males and 5 females). A total of 10 themes were estimated from the top 200 nouns. The participants mostly agreed that physical activity was effective in improving their mental health. They needed individualized, attractive, and easy mHealth services. Other estimated themes were: limited effects of non-leisure physical activity on mental health, lower priority on physical activity rather than sleep and rest, reluctance to share the data within the groups, and difficulties in wearing the devices to measure physical activity due to work rules. Conclusion: Workers’ perceptions of mHealth services were consistent with previous findings: the need for individualization, attraction, and ease of use. In the working population, mHealth services for physical activity and mental health should consider working conditions and focus on leisure-time physical activity. Social sharing might not be a mandatory technique because of the private topics and variety of associations between physical activity and mental health. © 2023 The Authors.",2023,,Environmental and Occupational Health Practice,5,1,,,10.1539/eohp.2022-0022-OA,,#943,Watanabe 2023,"",""
Unlocking the Power of EHRs: Harnessing Unstructured Data for Machine Learning-based Outcome Predictions,"Noaeen, M.; Amini, S.; Bhasker, S.; Ghezelsefli, Z.; Ahmed, A.; Jafarinezhad, O.; Abad, Z.S.H.","The integration of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with Machine Learning (ML) models has become imperative in examining patient outcomes due to the vast amounts of clinical data they provide. However, critical information regarding social and behavioral factors that affect health, such as social isolation, stress, and mental health complexities, is often recorded in unstructured clinical notes, hindering its accessibility. This has resulted in an over-reliance on clinical data in current EHR-based research, potentially leading to disparities in health outcomes. This study aims to evaluate the impact of incorporating patient-specific context from unstructured EHR data on the accuracy and stability of ML algorithms for predicting mortality, using the MIMIC III database. Results from the study confirmed the significance of incorporating patient-specific information into prediction models, leading to a notable improvement in the discriminatory power and robustness of the ML algorithms. Furthermore, the findings underline the importance of considering non-clinical factors related to a patient's daily life, in addition to clinical factors, when making predictions about patient outcomes. The advent of advanced generative models, such as GPT-4, presents new opportunities for effectively extracting social and behavioral factors from unstructured clinical notes, further enhancing the accuracy and stability of ML algorithms in predicting patient outcomes.

Multi-modal Multi-emotion Emotional Support Conversation,"Liu, G.; Dong, X.; Wang, M.-X.; Yu, J.; Gan, M.; Liu, W.; Yin, J.","This paper proposes a new task of Multi-modal Multi-emotion Emotional Support Conversation (MMESC), which has great value in various applications, such as counseling, daily chatting, and elderly company. This task aims to fully perceive the users’ emotional states from multiple modalities and generate appropriate responses to provide comfort for improving their feelings. Traditional works mainly focus on textual conversation, while a single-modal cannot accurately reflect the users’ emotions, such as saying fine with an inconsistent disgusting feeling. To address this problem, we propose a new task on multi-modalities and exploit a new method called FEAT for this new task. FEAT can integrate fine-grained emotional knowledge from multiple modalities. It first recognizes the users’ mental states based on an emotion-aware transformer. It then generates supportive responses using a hybrid method with multiple comfort strategies. To evaluate our method, we construct a large-scale dataset named MMESConv. It is almost two times larger than existing single-modal datasets. There are three modalities in this dataset (text, audio, and video) with fine-grained emotion annotations and strategy labels.

Yet, developing trustworthy and engaging health education and communication materials requires extensive expertise and substantial resources. In light of this, we propose an innovative approach that involves leveraging natural language processing (NLP) to classify publicly accessible lay articles based on their relevance and subject matter to pregnancy and mental health. Materials and methods: We manually reviewed online lay articles from credible and medically validated sources to create a gold standard corpus. This manual review process categorized the articles based on their pertinence to pregnancy and related subtopics. To streamline and expand the classification procedure for relevance and topics, we employed advanced NLP models such as Random Forest, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), and Generative Pre-trained Transformer model (gpt-3.5-turbo). Results: The gold standard corpus included 392 pregnancy-related articles. Our manual review process categorized the reading materials according to lifestyle factors associated with postpartum depression: diet, exercise, mental health, and health literacy. A BERT-based model performed best (F1 = 0.974) in an end-to-end classification of relevance and topics. In a two-step approach, given articles already classified as pregnancy-related, gpt-3.5-turbo performed best (F1 = 0.972) in classifying the above topics. Discussion: Utilizing NLP, we can guide patients to high-quality lay reading materials as cost-effective, readily available health education and communication sources.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate pain screening and reported pain of LGBT Veterans compared to non-LGBT Veterans. Methods: Using a retrospective cross-sectional cohort, data from the Corporate Data Warehouse, a national repository with clinical/ administrative data, were analyzed.

"Korean adolescents’ coping strategies on self-harm, ADHD, insomnia during COVID-19: text mining of social media big data","Do, R.; Kim, S.; Lim, Y.B.; Kim, S.-J.; Kwon, H.; Kim, J.-M.; Lee, S.; Kim, B.-N.","Introduction: Since the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), public safety measures, including social distancing and school closures, have been implemented, precipitating psychological difficulties and heightened online activities for adolescents. However, studies examining the impact of the pandemic on adolescent mental health and their coping strategies in Asian countries are limited. Further, most studies have used survey measures to capture mental health challenges so far. Accordingly, this study aimed to examine the psychological challenges South Korean adolescents experienced and their coping strategies during the pandemic using the Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Text mining (TM) technique on adolescents’ social media texts/posts. Methods: The data were gathered from social media texts/posts such as online communities, Twitter, and personal blogs from January 1, 2019, to October 31, 2021. The 12,520,250 texts containing keywords related to adolescents’ common psychological difficulties reported during the pandemic, including self-harm, Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorders (ADHD), and insomnia, were analyzed by TM, NLP using information extraction, co-occurrence and sentiment analysis. The monthly frequency of the keywords and their associated words was also analyzed to understand the time trend. Results: Adolescents used the word “self-harm” in their social media texts more frequently during the second wave of COVID-19 (August to September 2020). “Friends” was the most associated word with “self-harm.” While the frequency of texts with “Insomnia” stayed constant throughout the pandemic, the word “ADHD” was increasingly mentioned in social media. ADHD and insomnia were most frequently associated with ADHD medications and sleeping pills, respectively. Friends were generally associated with positive words, while parents were associated with negative words. Conclusion: During COVID-19, Korean adolescents often expressed their psychological challenges on social media platforms. However, their coping strategies seemed less efficient to help with their difficulties, warranting strategies to support them in the prolonged pandemic era. For example, Korean adolescents shared psychological challenges such as self-harm with friends rather than their parents. They considered using medicine (e.g., sleeping pills and ADHD medication) as coping strategies for sleep and attention problems.

Ensemble Learning with Tournament Selected Glowworm Swarm Optimization Algorithm for Cyberbullying Detection on Social Media,"Daniel, R.; Murthy, T.S.; Kumari, C.D.V.P.; Lydia, E.L.; Ishak, M.K.; Hadjouni, M.; Mostafa, S.M.","Online social network (OSN) plays a crucial role to facilitate social connections; but, this social networking media increases antisocial behaviors, like trolling, cyberbullying, and hate speech. Cyberbullying has often resulted in serious physical and mental distress, especially for children and women, and even sometimes forces them to commit suicide. Conventional techniques for detecting cyberbullying, such as relying on users to report the instance of bullying, are not always effective. Deep learning (DL) and Machine learning (ML) techniques are trained to automatically recognize and flag potential cyberbullying content, along with identifying behavior patterns that are indicative of cyberbullying. Therefore, this study concentrates on the design and development of ensemble deep learning with tournament-selected glowworm swarm optimization (EDL-TSGSO) algorithm for cyberbullying detection and classification on Twitter data. The goal of the study is to examine social media data through the use of natural language processing (NLP) and ensemble learning process.

Detection of Suicidal Ideation in Clinical Interviews for Depression Using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning: Cross-Sectional Study,"Li, T.M.H.; Chen, J.; Law, F.O.C.; Li, C.-T.; Chan, N.Y.; Chan, J.W.Y.; Chau, S.W.H.; Liu, Y.; Li, S.X.; Zhang, J.; Leung, K.-S.; Wing, Y.-K.","Background: Assessing patients’ suicide risk is challenging, especially among those who deny suicidal ideation. Primary care providers have poor agreement in screening suicide risk. Patients’ speech may provide more objective, language-based clues about their underlying suicidal ideation. Text analysis to detect suicide risk in depression is lacking in the literature. Objective: This study aimed to determine whether suicidal ideation can be detected via language features in clinical interviews for depression using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML). Methods: This cross-sectional study recruited 305 participants between October 2020 and May 2022 (mean age 53.0, SD 11.77 years; female: n=176, 57%), of which 197 had lifetime depression and 108 were healthy. This study was part of ongoing research on characterizing depression with a case-control design. In this study, 236 participants were nonsuicidal, while 56 and 13 had low and high suicide risks, respectively. The structured interview guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) was adopted to assess suicide risk and depression severity. Suicide risk was clinician rated based on a suicide-related question (H11). The interviews were transcribed and the words in participants’ verbal responses were translated into psychologically meaningful categories using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC). Results: Ordinal logistic regression revealed significant suicide-related language features in participants’ responses to the HAMD questions. Increased use of anger words when talking about work and activities posed the highest suicide risk (odds ratio [OR] 2.91, 95% CI 1.22-8.55; P=.02). Random forest models demonstrated that text analysis of the direct responses to H11 was effective in identifying individuals with high suicide risk (AUC 0.76-0.89; P<.001) and detecting suicide risk in general, including both low and high suicide risk (AUC 0.83-0.92; P<.001). More importantly, suicide risk can be detected with satisfactory performance even without patients’ disclosure of suicidal ideation. Based on the response to the question on hypochondriasis, ML models were trained to identify individuals with high suicide risk (AUC 0.76; P<.001). Conclusions: This study examined the perspective of using NLP and ML to analyze the texts from clinical interviews for suicidality detection, which has the potential to provide more accurate and specific markers for suicidal ideation detection. The findings may pave the way for developing high-performance assessment of suicide risk for automated detection, including online chatbot-based interviews for universal screening. © 2023 The Author(s).",2023,,JMIR Medical Informatics,11,1,,,10.2196/50221,,#979,Li 2023,"",""
"Exploring the role of AI in classifying, analyzing, and generating case reports on assisted suicide cases: feasibility and ethical implications","Spitale, G.; Schneider, G.; Germani, F.; Biller-Andorno, N.","This paper presents a study on the use of AI models for the classification of case reports on assisted suicide procedures. The database of the five Dutch regional bioethics committees was scraped to collect the 72 case reports available in English. We trained several AI models for classification according to the categories defined by the Dutch Termination of Life on Request and Assisted Suicide (Review Procedures) Act. We also conducted a related project to fine-tune an OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo large language model for generating new fictional but plausible cases. As AI is increasingly being used for judgement, it is possible to imagine an application in decision-making regarding assisted suicide. Here we explore two arising questions: feasibility and ethics, with the aim of contributing to a critical assessment of the potential role of AI in decision-making in highly sensitive areas.

ML-NLPEmot: Machine Learning-Natural Language Processing Event-Based Emotion Detection Proactive Framework Addressing Mental Health,"Ismail, L.; Shahin, N.; Materwala, H.; Hennebelle, A.; Frermann, L.","Global rapidly evolving events, e.g., COVID-19, are usually followed by countermeasures and policies. As a reaction, the public tends to express their emotions on social media platforms. Therefore, predicting emotional responses to events is critical to put a plan to avoid risky behaviors. This paper proposes a Machine Learning-Natural Language Processing-based framework to detect public emotions based on social media posts in response to specific events. It presents a precise measurement of population-level emotions which can aid governance in monitoring public response and guide it to put in place strategies such as targeted monitoring of mental health, to react to a rise in negative emotions in response to lockdowns, or information campaigns, for instance in response to elevated rates of fear in response to vaccination programs. We evaluate our framework by extracting 15,455 tweets. We annotate and categorize the emotions into 11 categories based on Plutchik's study of emotion and extract the features using a combination of Bag of Words and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency. We filter 813 COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets and use them to demonstrate our framework's effectiveness.

"Depression, anxiety, and burnout in academia: topic modeling of PubMed abstracts","Lezhnina, O.","The problem of mental health in academia is increasingly discussed in literature, and to extract meaningful insights from the growing amount of scientific publications, text mining approaches are used. In this study, BERTopic, an advanced method of topic modeling, was applied to abstracts of 2,846 PubMed articles on depression, anxiety, and burnout in academia published in years 1975–2023. BERTopic is a modular technique comprising a text embedding method, a dimensionality reduction procedure, a clustering algorithm, and a weighing scheme for topic representation. A model was selected based on the proportion of outliers, the topic interpretability considerations, topic coherence and topic diversity metrics, and the inevitable subjectivity of the criteria was discussed. The selected model with 27 topics was explored and visualized. The topics evolved differently with time: research papers on students' pandemic-related anxiety and medical residents' burnout peaked in recent years, while publications on psychometric research or internet-related problems are yet to be presented more amply.

"Investigating the Readability and Linguistic, Psychological, and Emotional Characteristics of Digital Dementia Information Written in the English Language: Multitrait-Multimethod Text Analysis","Engineer, M.; Kot, S.; Dixon, E.","Background: Past research in the Western context found that people with dementia search for digital dementia information in peer-reviewed medical research articles, dementia advocacy and medical organizations, and blogs written by other people with dementia. This past work also demonstrated that people with dementia do not perceive English digital dementia information as emotionally or cognitively accessible. Objective: In this study, we sought to investigate the readability; linguistic, psychological, and emotional characteristics; and target audiences of digital dementia information. We conducted a textual analysis of 3 different types of text-based digital dementia information written in English: 300 medical articles, 35 websites, and 50 blogs. Methods: We assessed the text’s readability using the Flesch Reading Ease and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level measurements, as well as tone, analytical thinking, clout, authenticity, and word frequencies using a natural language processing tool, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count Generator. We also conducted a thematic analysis to categorize the target audiences for each information source and used these categorizations for further statistical analysis. Results: The median Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level readability score and Flesch Reading Ease score for all types of information (N=1139) were 12.1 and 38.6, respectively, revealing that the readability scores of all 3 information types were higher than the minimum requirement. We found that medical articles had significantly (P=.05) higher word count and analytical thinking scores as well as significantly lower clout, authenticity, and emotional tone scores than websites and blogs. Further, blogs had significantly (P=.48) higher word count and authenticity scores but lower analytical scores than websites. Using thematic analysis, we found that most of the blogs (156/227, 68.7%) and web pages (399/612, 65.2%) were targeted at people with dementia. Website information targeted at a general audience had significantly lower readability scores. In addition, website information targeted at people with dementia had higher word count and lower emotional tone ratings. The information on websites targeted at caregivers had significantly higher clout and lower authenticity scores. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that there is an abundance of digital dementia information written in English that is targeted at people with dementia, but this information is not readable by a general audience. This is problematic considering that people with <12 years of education are at a higher risk of developing dementia. Further, our findings demonstrate that digital dementia information written in English has a negative tone, which may be a contributing factor to the mental health crisis many people with dementia face after receiving a diagnosis. Therefore, we call for content creators to lower readability scores to make the information more accessible to a general audience and to focus their efforts on providing information in a way that does not perpetuate overly negative narratives of dementia. ©Margi Engineer, Sushant Kot, Emma Dixon.",2023,,JMIR Formative Research,7,1,,,10.2196/48143,,#1001,Engineer 2023,"",""
How You Feelin'? Learning Emotions and Mental States in Movie Scenes,"Srivastava, D.; Singh, A.K.; Tapaswi, M.","Movie story analysis requires understanding characters' emotions and mental states. Towards this goal, we formulate emotion understanding as predicting a diverse and multi-label set of emotions at the level of a movie scene and for each character. We propose EmoTx, a multimodal Transformer-based architecture that ingests videos, multiple characters, and dialog utterances to make joint predictions. By leveraging annotations from the MovieGraphs dataset [72], we aim to predict classic emotions (e.g. happy, angry) and other mental states (e.g. honest, helpful). We conduct experiments on the most frequently occurring 10 and 25 labels, and a mapping that clusters 181 labels to 26. Ablation studies and comparison against adapted state-of-the-art emotion recognition approaches shows the effectiveness of EmoTx.

Social media platforms can generate valuable insights into patient-reported health outcomes as the content is produced at high resolution by patients and caregivers, representing experiences that may be unavailable to most clinicians. Objective: In this study, we aimed to determine the validity and effectiveness of advanced natural language processing approaches built to derive insight into PCC-related patient-reported health outcomes from social media platforms Twitter and Reddit. We extracted PCC-related terms, including symptoms and conditions, and measured their occurrence frequency. We compared the outputs with human annotations and clinical outcomes and tracked symptom and condition term occurrences over time and locations to explore the pipeline’s potential as a surveillance tool. Methods: We used bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) models to extract and normalize PCC symptom and condition terms from English posts on Twitter and Reddit. We compared 2 named entity recognition models and implemented a 2-step normalization task to map extracted terms to unique concepts in standardized terminology. The normalization steps were done using a semantic search approach with BERT biencoders. We evaluated the effectiveness of BERT models in extracting the terms using a human-annotated corpus and a proximity-based score. We also compared the validity and reliability of the extracted and normalized terms to a web-based survey with more than 3000 participants from several countries. Results: UmlsBERT-Clinical had the highest accuracy in predicting entities closest to those extracted by human annotators. Based on our findings, the top 3 most commonly occurring groups of PCC symptom and condition terms were systemic (such as fatigue), neuropsychiatric (such as anxiety and brain fog), and respiratory (such as shortness of breath). In addition, we also found novel symptom and condition terms that had not been categorized in previous studies, such as infection and pain. Regarding the co-occurring symptoms, the pair of fatigue and headaches was among the most co-occurring term pairs across both platforms. Based on the temporal analysis, the neuropsychiatric terms were the most prevalent, followed by the systemic category, on both social media platforms. Our spatial analysis concluded that 42% (10,938/26,247) of the analyzed terms included location information, with the majority coming from the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. Conclusions: The outcome of our social media–derived pipeline is comparable with the results of peer-reviewed articles relevant to PCC symptoms.

The Potential of Chatbots for Emotional Support and Promoting Mental Well-Being in Different Cultures: Mixed Methods Study,"Chin, H.; Song, H.; Baek, G.; Shin, M.; Jung, C.; Cha, M.; Choi, J.; Cha, C.","Background: Artificial intelligence chatbot research has focused on technical advances in natural language processing and validating the effectiveness of human-machine conversations in specific settings. However, real-world chat data remain proprietary and unexplored despite their growing popularity, and new analyses of chatbot uses and their effects on mitigating negative moods are urgently needed. Objective: In this study, we investigated whether and how artificial intelligence chatbots facilitate the expression of user emotions, specifically sadness and depression. We also examined cultural differences in the expression of depressive moods among users in Western and Eastern countries. Methods: This study used SimSimi, a global open-domain social chatbot, to analyze 152,783 conversation utterances containing the terms “depress” and “sad” in 3 Western countries (Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and 5 Eastern countries (Indonesia, India, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand). Study 1 reports new findings on the cultural differences in how people talk about depression and sadness to chatbots based on Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count and n-gram analyses. In study 2, we classified chat conversations into predefined topics using semisupervised classification techniques to better understand the types of depressive moods prevalent in chats. We then identified the distinguishing features of chat-based depressive discourse data and the disparity between Eastern and Western users. Results: Our data revealed intriguing cultural differences. Chatbot users in Eastern countries indicated stronger emotions about depression than users in Western countries (positive: P<.001; negative: P=.01); for example, Eastern users used more words associated with sadness (P=.01). However, Western users were more likely to share vulnerable topics such as mental health (P<.001), and this group also had a greater tendency to discuss sensitive topics such as swear words (P<.001) and death (P<.001). In addition, when talking to chatbots, people expressed their depressive moods differently than on other platforms. Users were more open to expressing emotional vulnerability related to depressive or sad moods to chatbots (74,045/148,590, 49.83%) than on social media (149/1978, 7.53%). Chatbot conversations tended not to broach topics that require social support from others, such as seeking advice on daily life difficulties, unlike on social media. However, chatbot users acted in anticipation of conversational agents that exhibit active listening skills and foster a safe space where they can openly share emotional states such as sadness or depression. Conclusions: The findings highlight the potential of chatbot-assisted mental health support, emphasizing the importance of continued technical and policy-wise efforts to improve chatbot interactions for those in need of emotional assistance.

Identifying Rare Circumstances Preceding Female Firearm Suicides: Validating A Large Language Model Approach,"Zhou, W.; Prater, L.C.; Goldstein, E.V.; Mooney, S.J.","Background: Firearm suicide has been more prevalent among males, but age-adjusted female firearm suicide rates increased by 20% from 2010 to 2020, outpacing the rate increase among males by about 8 percentage points, and female firearm suicide may have different contributing circumstances. In the United States, the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) is a comprehensive source of data on violent deaths and includes unstructured incident narrative reports from coroners or medical examiners and law enforcement. Conventional natural language processing approaches have been used to identify common circumstances preceding female firearm suicide deaths but failed to identify rarer circumstances due to insufficient training data. Objective: This study aimed to leverage a large language model approach to identify infrequent circumstances preceding female firearm suicide in the unstructured coroners or medical examiners and law enforcement narrative reports available in the NVDRS. Methods: We used the narrative reports of 1462 female firearm suicide decedents in the NVDRS from 2014 to 2018. The reports were written in English. We coded 9 infrequent circumstances preceding female firearm suicides. We experimented with predicting those circumstances by leveraging a large language model approach in a yes/no question-answer format. We measured the prediction accuracy with F1-score (ranging from 0 to 1). F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision (positive predictive value) and recall (true positive rate or sensitivity). Results: Our large language model outperformed a conventional support vector machine–supervised machine learning approach by a wide margin. Compared to the support vector machine model, which had F1-scores less than 0.2 for most infrequent circumstances, our large language model approach achieved an F1-score of over 0.6 for 4 circumstances and 0.8 for 2 circumstances. Conclusions: The use of a large language model approach shows promise. Researchers interested in using natural language processing to identify infrequent circumstances in narrative report data may benefit from large language models. ©Weipeng Zhou, Laura C Prater, Evan V Goldstein, Stephen J Mooney.

A Benchmark for Understanding Dialogue Safety in Mental Health Support,"Qiu, H.; Zhao, T.; Li, A.; Zhang, S.; He, H.; Lan, Z.","Dialogue safety remains a pervasive challenge in open-domain human-machine interaction. Existing approaches propose distinctive dialogue safety taxonomies and datasets for detecting explicitly harmful responses. However, these taxonomies may not be suitable for analyzing response safety in mental health support. In real-world interactions, a model response deemed acceptable in casual conversations might have a negligible positive impact on users seeking mental health support. To address these limitations, this paper aims to develop a theoretically and factually grounded taxonomy that prioritizes the positive impact on help-seekers. Additionally, we create a benchmark corpus with fine-grained labels for each dialogue session to facilitate further research. We analyze the dataset using popular language models, including BERT-base, RoBERTa-large, and ChatGPT, to detect and understand unsafe responses within the context of mental health support. Our study reveals that ChatGPT struggles to detect safety categories with detailed safety definitions in a zero- and few-shot paradigm, whereas the fine-tuned model proves to be more suitable.

Beyond plain toxic: building datasets for detection of flammable topics and inappropriate statements,"Babakov, N.; Logacheva, V.; Panchenko, A.","Toxicity on the Internet is an acknowledged problem. It includes a wide range of actions from the use of obscene words to offenses and hate speech toward particular users or groups of people. However, there also exist other types of inappropriate messages which are usually not viewed as toxic as they do not contain swear words or explicit offenses. Such messages can contain covert toxicity or generalizations, incite harmful actions (crime, suicide, drug use), and provoke “heated” discussions. These messages are often related to particular sensitive topics, e.g. politics, sexual minorities, or social injustice. Such topics tend to yield toxic emotional reactions more often than other topics, e.g. cars or computing. At the same time, not all messages within “flammable” topics are inappropriate. This work focuses on automatically detecting inappropriate language in natural texts. This is crucial for monitoring user-generated content and developing dialogue systems and AI assistants. While many works focus on toxicity detection, we highlight the fact that texts can be harmful without being toxic or containing obscene language. Blind censorship based on keywords is a common approach to address these issues, but it limits a system’s functionality. This work proposes a safe and effective solution to serve broad user needs and develop necessary resources and tools. Thus, machinery for inappropriateness detection could be useful (i) for making communication on the Internet safer, more productive, and inclusive by flagging truly inappropriate content while not banning messages blindly by topic; (ii) for detection of inappropriate messages generated by automatic systems, e.g. neural chatbots, due to biases in training data; (iii) for debiasing training data for language models (e.g. BERT and GPT-2). Towards this end, in this work, we present two text collections labeled according to a binary notion of inappropriateness (124,597 samples) and a multinomial notion of sensitive topic (33,904 samples). Assuming that the notion of inappropriateness is common among people of the same culture, we base our approach on a human intuitive understanding of what is not acceptable and harmful. To devise an objective view of inappropriateness, we define it in a data-driven way through crowdsourcing. Namely, we run a large-scale annotation study asking workers if a given chatbot-generated utterance could harm the reputation of the company that created this chatbot. High values of inter-annotator agreement suggest that the notion of inappropriateness exists and can be uniformly understood by different people. To define the notion of a sensitive topic in an objective way we use guidelines suggested by specialists in the Legal and PR departments of a large company. We use the collected datasets to train inappropriateness and sensitive topic classifiers employing both classic and Transformer-based models. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",2023,,Language Resources and Evaluation,,,,,10.1007/s10579-023-09682-z,,#1030,Babakov 2023,"",""
Scarcity of research on psychological or psychiatric states using validated questionnaires in low- and middle-income countries: A ChatGPT-assisted bibliometric analysis and national case study on some psychometric properties,"Rudan, D.; Marčinko, D.; Degmečić, D.; Jakšić, N.","Background It is vital to assess whether research on psychological or psychiatric states using validated questionnaires is still lagging in low- and middle-income countries and to what degree, and to continue to assess the psychometric properties of the most informative questionnaires. Methods We performed a bibliometric analysis of Web of Science Core Collection for all years to determine the number of studies performed in each country that used an inventory or a questionnaire on aggression, anxiety, depression, borderline personality, narcissism, self-harm, shame, or childhood trauma. We conducted a simple observational analysis of distributions by countries to derive the main overall conclusions, assisted by ChatGPT to test its ability to summarise and interpret this type of information. We also carried out a study in Croatia to examine some psychometric properties of five commonly used questionnaires, using Cronbach’s a coefficient and zero-order correlations. Results We observed a concentration of research activity in a few high-income countries, primarily the United States and several European nations, suggesting a robust research infrastructure and a strong emphasis on studying psychological and psychiatric states within their population. In contrast, low- and middle-income countries were notably under-represented in research on psychological and psychiatric states, although the gap seems to be closing in some countries. Turkey, Iran, Brazil, South Africa, Mexico, India, Malaysia and Pakistan have been consistently contributing an increasing number of studies and catching up with the most research-intensive high-income countries. The national case study in Croatia confirmed adequate psychometric properties of the most frequently used questionnaires. Conclusions Addressing research gaps in low- and middle-income countries is crucial, because relying solely on research from high-income countries may not fully capture the nuances of psychological and psychiatric states within diverse populations. To bridge this gap, it is essential to prioritise mental health research in low-resource settings, provide training and resources to local researchers, and establish international collaborations. Such efforts can lead to the development of culturally valid questionnaires, an improved understanding of psychological and psychiatric states in diverse contexts, and the creation of effective interventions to promote mental well-being on a global scale. © 2023 The Author(s).

Firstly, a public mental health Q&A dataset has been collected, and then the data have been manually screened to obtain mental health Q&A dataset for the elderly. Based on this dataset, combined with the semantic data related to neurology for the elderly, the knowledge graph of mental health of the elderly has been constructed. Then, the problem matching module has been used to determine and analyze the types of problems faced by the elderly and generate corresponding answers to the questions. For the questions related to psychological counseling of the elderly, the BERT and BiLSTM-CRF network have been used to calculate the question template closest to the user’s question in the system, and find the corresponding answer matching the question in the knowledge graph. The experimental results show that the system can effectively understand the intention of elderly users to ask questions, and has good accuracy and reliability in answering elderly mental health related questions, which helps to address the mental health service needs of the elderly. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2023.",2023,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),14305 LNCS,,50-62,,10.1007/978-981-99-7108-4_5,,#1042,He 2023,"",""
Automatic Extraction of Research Themes in Epidemiological Criminology From PubMed Abstracts From 1946 to 2020: Text Mining Study,"Karystianis, G.; Simpson, P.; Lukmanjaya, W.; Ginnivan, N.; Nenadic, G.; Buchan, I.; Butler, T.","Background: The emerging field of epidemiological criminology studies the intersection between public health and justice systems. To increase the value of and reduce waste in research activities in this area, it is important to perform transparent research priority setting considering the needs of research beneficiaries and end users along with a systematic assessment of the existing research activities to address gaps and harness opportunities. Objective: In this study, we aimed to examine published research outputs in epidemiological criminology to assess gaps between published outputs and current research priorities identified by prison stakeholders. Methods: A rule-based method was applied to 23,904 PubMed epidemiological criminology abstracts to extract the study determinants and outcomes (ie, “themes”). These were mapped against the research priorities identified by Australian prison stakeholders to assess the differences from research outputs. The income level of the affiliation country of the first authors was also identified to compare the ranking of research priorities in countries categorized by income levels. Results: On an evaluation set of 100 abstracts, the identification of themes returned an F1-score of 90%, indicating reliable performance. More than 53.3% (11,927/22,361) of the articles had at least 1 extracted theme; the most common was substance use (1533/11,814, 12.97%), followed by HIV (1493/11,814, 12.64%). The infectious disease category (2949/11,814, 24.96%) was the most common research priority category, followed by mental health (2840/11,814, 24.04%) and alcohol and other drug use (2433/11,814, 20.59%). A comparison between the extracted themes and the stakeholder priorities showed an alignment for mental health, infectious diseases, and alcohol and other drug use. Although behavior- and juvenile-related themes were common, they did not feature as prison priorities. Most studies were conducted in high-income countries (10,083/11,814, 85.35%), while countries with the lowest income status focused half of their research on infectious diseases (47/91, 52%). Conclusions: The identification of research themes from PubMed epidemiological criminology research abstracts is possible through the application of a rule-based text mining method. The frequency of the investigated themes may reflect historical developments concerning disease prevalence, treatment advances, and the social understanding of illness and incarcerated populations. The differences between income status groups are likely to be explained by local health priorities and immediate health risks. Notable gaps between stakeholder research priorities and research outputs concerned themes that were more focused on social factors and systems and may reflect publication bias or self-publication selection, highlighting the need for further © The Author(s) 2024.",2023,,JMIR Formative Research,7,1,,,10.2196/49721,,#1044,Karystianis 2023,"",""
NeuroBridge: a prototype platform for discovery of the long-tail neuroimaging data,"Wang, L.; Ambite, J.L.; Appaji, A.; Bijsterbosch, J.; Dockes, J.; Herrick, R.; Kogan, A.; Lander, H.; Marcus, D.; Moore, S.M.; Poline, J.-B.; Rajasekar, A.; Sahoo, S.S.; Turner, M.D.; Wang, X.; Wang, Y.; Turner, J.A.","Introduction: Open science initiatives have enabled sharing of large amounts of already collected data. However, significant gaps remain regarding how to find appropriate data, including underutilized data that exist in the long tail of science. We demonstrate the NeuroBridge prototype and its ability to search PubMed Central full-text papers for information relevant to neuroimaging data collected from schizophrenia and addiction studies. Methods: The NeuroBridge architecture contained the following components: (1) Extensible ontology for modeling study metadata: subject population, imaging techniques, and relevant behavioral, cognitive, or clinical data. Details are described in the companion paper in this special issue; (2) A natural-language based document processor that leveraged pre-trained deep-learning models on a small-sample document corpus to establish efficient representations for each article as a collection of machine-recognized ontological terms; (3) Integrated search using ontology-driven similarity to query PubMed Central and NeuroQuery, which provides fMRI activation maps along with PubMed source articles. Results: The NeuroBridge prototype contains a corpus of 356 papers from 2018 to 2021 describing schizophrenia and addiction neuroimaging studies, of which 186 were annotated with the NeuroBridge ontology. The search portal on the NeuroBridge website https://neurobridges.org/ provides an interactive Query Builder, where the user builds queries by selecting NeuroBridge ontology terms to preserve the ontology tree structure. For each return entry, links to the PubMed abstract as well as to the PMC full-text article, if available, are presented. For each of the returned articles, we provide a list of clinical assessments described in the Section “Methods” of the article. Articles returned from NeuroQuery based on the same search are also presented. Conclusion: The NeuroBridge prototype combines ontology-based search with natural-language text-mining approaches to demonstrate that papers relevant to a user’s research question can be identified. The NeuroBridge prototype takes a first step toward identifying potential neuroimaging data described in full-text papers. Toward the overall goal of discovering “enough data of the right kind,” ongoing work includes validating the document processor with a larger corpus, extending the ontology to include detailed imaging data, and extracting information regarding data availability from the returned publications and incorporating XNAT-based neuroimaging databases to enhance data accessibility.

Lexical Stability of Psychiatric Clinical Notes from Electronic Health Records over a Decade,"Hansen, L.; Enevoldsen, K.; Bernstorff, M.; Perfalk, E.; Danielsen, A.A.; Nielbo, K.L.; Østergaard, S.D.","Objective: Natural Language Processing methods hold promise for improving clinical prediction by utilising information otherwise hidden in the clinical notes of electronic health records. However, clinical practice - as well as the systems and databases in which clinical notes are recorded and stored - change over time. As a consequence, the content of clinical notes may also change over time, which could degrade the performance of prediction models. Despite its importance, the stability of clinical notes over time has rarely been tested. Methods: The lexical stability of clinical notes from the Psychiatric Services of the Central Denmark Region in the period from January 1, 2011, to November 22, 2021 (a total of 14,811,551 clinical notes describing 129,570 patients) was assessed by quantifying sentence length, readability, syntactic complexity and clinical content. Changepoint detection models were used to estimate potential changes in these metrics. Results: We find lexical stability of the clinical notes over time, with minor deviations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Out of 2988 datapoints, 17 possible changepoints (corresponding to 0.6%) were detected. The majority of these were related to the discontinuation of a specific note type. Conclusion: We find lexical and syntactic stability of clinical notes from psychiatric services over time, which bodes well for the use of Natural Language Processing for predictive modelling in clinical psychiatry.  © Scandinavian College of Neuropsychopharmacology 2023.",2023,,Acta Neuropsychiatrica,,,,,10.1017/neu.2023.46,,#1047,Hansen 2023,"",""
Multi-modal Facial Affective Analysis based on Masked Autoencoder,"Zhang, W.; Ma, B.; Qiu, F.; Ding, Y.","Human affective behavior analysis focuses on analyzing human expressions or other behaviors to enhance the understanding of human psychology. The CVPR 2023 Competition on Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW) is dedicated to providing high-quality and large-scale Affwild2 for the recognition of commonly used emotion representations, such as Action Units (AU), basic expression categories (EXPR), and Valence-Arousal (VA). The competition is committed to making significant strides in improving the accuracy and practicality of affective analysis research in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce our submission to the CVPR 2023: ABAW5. Our approach involves several key components. First, we utilize the visual information from a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) model that has been pre-trained on a large-scale face image dataset in a self-supervised manner. Next, we finetune the MAE encoder on the image frames from the Aff-wild2 for AU, EXPR and VA tasks, which can be regarded as a static and uni-modal training. Additionally, we leverage the multi-modal and temporal information from the videos and implement a transformer-based framework to fuse the multimodal features. Our approach achieves impressive results in the ABAW5 competition, with an average F1 score of 55.49% and 41.21% in the AU and EXPR tracks, respectively, and an average CCC of 0.6372 in the VA track.

Automatic Classification of Tweets Identifying Mental Health Conditions in Central American Population in a Pandemic,"Cedeno-Moreno, D.; Vargas-Lombardo, M.; Navarro, N.","The Covid-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on the physical health of the Central American population. Fear, anxiety and stress were normal reactions in quarantine, due to the uncertainty of the unknown, which makes it understandable that the population experienced feelings or psychological affections. Social networks were the means of communication for thousands of people in quarantine. The increased use of social networks to share comments, content and opinions makes it possible to have a large amount of information. Twitter has been one of the most widely used social networks due to its ease of access and use. The analysis of tweets requires a systematic process for their collection, transformation and classification, integrating different artificial intelligence tools such as natural language processing, automatic learning or deep learning. Automatic text classification aims at finding an adequate way to categorize the documents according to the attributes made up of words that describe each specific category. For this reason, our study has been carried out with a corpus in Spanish extracted from Twitter for the automatic classification of texts, from which we have categorized, through the automatic learning approach, the tweets about Covid-19 in the Central American region, in order to know if the population has suffered any psychological effects. Based on the results, we can say that the automatic learning models provide competitive results in terms of automatic identification of texts with an accuracy of 89%. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2023,,Communications in Computer and Information Science,1873 CCIS,,123-137,,10.1007/978-3-031-45682-4_10,,#1050,Cedeno-Moreno 2023,"",""

Development of an ontology to characterize mental functioning,"Sacco, M.J.; Divita, G.; Rasch, E.","Purpose of the article: This article describes a conceptual and methodological approach to integrating functional information into an ontology to categorize mental functioning, which to date is an under-developed area of classification, and supports our work with the United States (U.S.) Social Security Administration (SSA). Design and Methodological procedures: Conceptualizing and defining mental functioning was paramount to develop natural language processing (NLP) tools to support our use case. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) was the framework used to conceptualize mental functioning at the activities and participation level in clinical records. To address challenges that arose when applying the ICF as to what should or should not be classified as mental functioning, a mental functioning domain ontology was developed that rearranged, reclassified and incorporated all ICF key components, concepts, classifications, and their definitions. Conclusions: Challenges emerged in the extent to which we could directly align components in the ICF into an applied ontology of mental functioning. These conceptual challenges required rearrangement of ICF components to adequately support our use case within the social security disability determination process. Findings also have implications to support future NLP efforts for behavioral health outcomes and policy research. © This work was authored as part of the Contributor’s official duties as an Employee of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

Highest Accuracy Based Automated Depression Prediction Using Natural Language Processing,"Tharun, S.V.; Saranya, G.; Tamilvizhi, T.; Surendran, R.","In today's fast-paced society, psychological health issues such as anxiety, depression, and stress have become prevalent among the general population. Researchers have explored the use of machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of depression in individuals. As datasets related to depression become more abundant and machine learning technology advances, there is an opportunity to develop intelligent systems capable of identifying symptoms of depression in written material. By applying natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to analyze written text, such as social media posts, emails, and chat messages, researchers can potentially identify patterns and linguistic cues associated with depression. These patterns may include changes in word usage, tone, and sentiment. The dataset consists of text-based questions on this information channel. At present, machine learning techniques are highly effective for analyzing data and identifying problems. Researchers have conducted comparisons of the accuracy achieved by different machine learning algorithms using the complete set of attributes as well as a subset of selected attributes.

Examining the Supports and Advice That Women With Intimate Partner Violence Experience Received in Online Health Communities: Text Mining Approach,"Hui, V.; Eby, M.; Constantino, R.E.; Lee, H.; Zelazny, J.; Chang, J.C.; He, D.; Lee, Y.J.","Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is an underreported public health crisis primarily affecting women associated with severe health conditions and can lead to a high rate of homicide. Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, more women with IPV experiences visited online health communities (OHCs) to seek help because of anonymity. However, little is known regarding whether their help requests were answered and whether the information provided was delivered in an appropriate manner. To understand the help-seeking information sought and given in OHCs, extraction of postings and linguistic features could be helpful to develop automated models to improve future help-seeking experiences. Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the types and patterns (ie, communication styles) of the advice offered by OHC members and whether the information received from women matched their expressed needs in their initial postings. Methods: We examined data from Reddit using data from subreddit community r/domesticviolence posts from November 14, 2020, through November 14, 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic. We included posts from women aged ≥18 years who self-identified or described experiencing IPV and requested advice or help in this subreddit community. Posts from nonabused women and women aged <18 years, non-English posts, good news announcements, gratitude posts without any advice seeking, and posts related to advertisements were excluded. We developed a codebook and annotated the postings in an iterative manner. Initial posts were also quantified using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count to categorize linguistic and posting features. Postings were then classified into 2 categories (ie, matched needs and unmatched needs) according to the types of help sought and received in OHCs to capture the help-seeking result. Nonparametric statistical analysis (ie, 2-tailed t test or Mann-Whitney U test) was used to compare the linguistic and posting features between matched and unmatched needs. Results: Overall, 250 postings were included, and 200 (80%) posting response comments matched with the type of help requested in initial postings, with legal advice and IPV knowledge achieving the highest matching rate. Overall, 17 linguistic or posting features were found to be significantly different between the 2 groups (ie, matched help and unmatched help). Positive title sentiment and linguistic features in postings containing health and wellness wordings were associated with unmatched needs postings, whereas the other 14 features were associated with postings with matched needs. Conclusions: OHCs can extract the linguistic and posting features to understand the help-seeking result among women with IPV experiences. Features identified in this corpus reflected the differences found between the 2 groups. This is the first study that leveraged Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count to shed light on generating predictive features from unstructured text in OHCs, which could guide future algorithm development to detect help-seeking results within OHCs effectively. ©Vivian Hui, Malavika Eby, Rose Eva Constantino, Heeyoung Lee, Jamie Zelazny, Judy C Chang, Daqing He, Young Ji Lee.",2023,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,25,1,,,10.2196/48607,,#1086,Hui 2023,"",""

The Problem of Concept Learning and Goals of Reasoning in Large Language Models,"Chuganskaya, A.A.; Kovalev, A.K.; Panov, A.","Modern large language models (LLMs) show good performance in the zero-shot or few-shot learning. This ability ability is a significant result even on tasks for which the models have not been trained is in part due to the fact that by learning from textual internet-scale data, such models build a semblance of a model of the world. However, the question of whether the entities on which that the model operates are concepts in the psychological sense remains open. Relying on conceptual reasoning schemes allows to increase the safety of models in solving complex problems. To address this question, we propose to use standard psychodiagnostic techniques to assess the quality of conceptual thinking of models. We test this hypothesis, by conducting experiments on a dataset adapted for LLMs from the psychological techniques of Kettel and Rubinstein and comparing the effectiveness of each of them. In this paper, we have shown that it is possible to distinguish several types of model errors in incorrect answers to standard tasks on conceptual thinking and to evaluate the type according to the classifications of distortions of conceptual thinking adopted in cultural and historical approaches in psychology. This makes it possible to use the tool of psychodiagnostic techniques not only to evaluate the effectiveness of models, but also to develop training procedures based on such tasks. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2023,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),14001 LNAI,,661-672,,10.1007/978-3-031-40725-3_56,,#1096,Chuganskaya 2023,"",""
Public Surveillance of Social Media for Suicide Using Advanced Deep Learning Models in Japan: Time Series Study From 2012 to 2022,"Wang, S.; Ning, H.; Huang, X.; Xiao, Y.; Zhang, M.; Yang, E.F.; Sadahiro, Y.; Liu, Y.; Li, Z.; Hu, T.; Fu, X.; Zeng, Y.","Background: Social media platforms have been increasingly used to express suicidal thoughts, feelings, and acts, raising public concerns over time. A large body of literature has explored the suicide risks identified by people's expressions on social media. However, there is not enough evidence to conclude that social media provides public surveillance for suicide without aligning suicide risks detected on social media with actual suicidal behaviors. Corroborating this alignment is a crucial foundation for suicide prevention and intervention through social media and for estimating and predicting suicide in countries with no reliable suicide statistics. Objective: This study aimed to corroborate whether the suicide risks identified on social media align with actual suicidal behaviors. This aim was achieved by tracking suicide risks detected by 62 million tweets posted in Japan over a 10-year period and assessing the locational and temporal alignment of such suicide risks with actual suicide behaviors recorded in national suicide statistics. Methods: This study used a human-in-the-loop approach to identify suicide-risk tweets posted in Japan from January 2013 to December 2022. This approach involved keyword-filtered data mining, data scanning by human efforts, and data refinement via an advanced natural language processing model termed Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. The tweet-identified suicide risks were then compared with actual suicide records in both temporal and spatial dimensions to validate if they were statistically correlated. Results: Twitter-identified suicide risks and actual suicide records were temporally correlated by month in the 10 years from 2013 to 2022 (correlation coefficient=0.533; P < .001); this correlation coefficient is higher at 0.652 when we advanced the Twitter-identified suicide risks 1 month earlier to compare with the actual suicide records. These 2 indicators were also spatially correlated by city with a correlation coefficient of 0.699 (P < .001) for the 10-year period. Among the 267 cities with the top quintile of suicide risks identified from both tweets and actual suicide records, 73.5% (n=196) of cities overlapped. In addition, Twitter-identified suicide risks were at a relatively lower level after midnight compared to a higher level in the afternoon, as well as a higher level on Sundays and Saturdays compared to weekdays. Conclusions: Social media platforms provide an anonymous space where people express their suicidal thoughts, ideation, and acts. Such expressions can serve as an alternative source to estimating and predicting suicide in countries without reliable suicide statistics. It can also provide real-time tracking of suicide risks, serving as an early warning for suicide. The identification of areas where suicide risks are highly concentrated is crucial for location-based mental health planning, enabling suicide prevention and intervention through social media in a spatially and temporally explicit manner. © Siqin Wang, Huan Ning, Xiao Huang, Yunyu Xiao, Mengxi Zhang, Ellie Fan Yang, Yukio Sadahiro, Yan Liu, Zhenlong Li, Tao Hu, Xiaokang Fu, Zi Li, Ye Zeng.

AVCA: Autonomous Virtual Cognitive Assessment,"Karimi, B.; Zabihi, S.; Keynia, A.; Montazami, A.; Mohammadi, A.","Fast-paced and ever-growing advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) models have initiated works on autonomous monitoring/screening systems to assess individuals’ cognitive state. In conventional cognitive assessment systems, a physician evaluates the mental abilities of the brain by rating the patient’s numerical, verbal, and logical responses. Development of an autonomous cognitive assessment system that assist the physician is both of significant importance and a critically challenging task. As a first step towards achieving this objective, in the paper an Automated Virtual Cognitive Assessment (AVCA ) framework is proposed that integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) and hand gesture recognition techniques. The proposed AVCA framework provides individual scores in the seven major cognitive domains, i.e., orientation, attention, language, contractual ability, memory, calculation, and reasoning. More specifically, the AVCA framework is an autonomous cognitive assessment system that receives audio and video signals in a real-time fashion, and performs semantic and synthetic analysis using NLP techniques and DNN models. Real-time video processing engines of the AVCA monitors hand motions and facilitate simpler engagement for visual evaluation. Additionally, we propose an efficient model to facilitate human-machine interactions from speech recognition to text classification. In particular, an unsupervised contrastive learning framework is proposed using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) that outperforms its state-of-the-art unsupervised counterparts achieving an average of 77.84% Sparsman’s correlation on standard Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) tasks. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE, part of Springer Nature.",2023,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),13850 LNCS,,26-47,,10.1007/978-3-662-67868-8_3,,#1109,Karimi 2023,"",""
LonXplain: Lonesomeness as a Consequence of Mental Disturbance in Reddit Posts,"Garg, M.; Saxena, C.; Samanta, D.; Dorr, B.J.","Social media is a potential source of information that infers latent mental states through Natural Language Processing (NLP). While narrating real-life experiences, social media users convey their feeling of loneliness or isolated lifestyle, impacting their mental well-being. Existing literature on psychological theories points to loneliness as the major consequence of interpersonal risk factors, propounding the need to investigate loneliness as a major aspect of mental disturbance. We formulate lonesomeness detection in social media posts as an explainable binary classification problem, discovering the users at-risk, suggesting the need of resilience for early control. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing explainable dataset, i.e., one with human-readable, annotated text spans, to facilitate further research and development in loneliness detection causing mental disturbance [9].

Development of a Corpus Annotated With Mentions of Pain in Mental Health Records: Natural Language Processing Approach,"Chaturvedi, J.; Chance, N.; Mirza, L.; Vernugopan, V.; Velupillai, S.; Stewart, R.; Roberts, A.","Background: Pain is a widespread issue, with 20% of adults (1 in 5) experiencing it globally. A strong association has been demonstrated between pain and mental health conditions, and this association is known to exacerbate disability and impairment. Pain is also known to be strongly related to emotions, which can lead to damaging consequences. As pain is a common reason for people to access health care facilities, electronic health records (EHRs) are a potential source of information on this pain. Mental health EHRs could be particularly beneficial since they can show the overlap of pain with mental health. Most mental health EHRs contain the majority of their information within the free-text sections of the records. However, it is challenging to extract information from free text. Natural language processing (NLP) methods are therefore required to extract this information from the text. Objective: This research describes the development of a corpus of manually labeled mentions of pain and pain-related entities from the documents of a mental health EHR database, for use in the development and evaluation of future NLP methods. Methods: The EHR database used, Clinical Record Interactive Search, consists of anonymized patient records from The South London and Maudsley National Health Service Foundation Trust in the United Kingdom. The corpus was developed through a process of manual annotation where pain mentions were marked as relevant (ie, referring to physical pain afflicting the patient), negated (ie, indicating absence of pain), or not relevant (ie, referring to pain affecting someone other than the patient, or metaphorical and hypothetical mentions). Relevant mentions were also annotated with additional attributes such as anatomical location affected by pain, pain character, and pain management measures, if mentioned. Results: A total of 5644 annotations were collected from 1985 documents (723 patients). Over 70% (n=4028) of the mentions found within the documents were annotated as relevant, and about half of these mentions also included the anatomical location affected by the pain. The most common pain character was chronic pain, and the most commonly mentioned anatomical location was the chest. Most annotations (n=1857, 33%) were from patients who had a primary diagnosis of mood disorders (International Classification of Diseases—10th edition, chapter F30-39). Conclusions: This research has helped better understand how pain is mentioned within the context of mental health EHRs and provided insight into the kind of information that is typically mentioned around pain in such a data source. In future work, the extracted information will be used to develop and evaluate a machine learning–based NLP application to automatically extract relevant pain information from EHR databases. ©Jaya Chaturvedi, Natalia Chance, Luwaiza Mirza, Veshalee Vernugopan, Sumithra Velupillai, Robert Stewart, Angus Roberts.",2023,,JMIR Formative Research,7,,,,10.2196/45849,,#1127,Chaturvedi 2023,"",""
Explainable Causal Analysis of Mental Health on Social Media Data,"Saxena, C.; Garg, M.; Ansari, G.","With recent developments in Social Computing, Natural Language Processing and Clinical Psychology, the social NLP research community addresses the challenge of automation in mental illness on social media. A recent extension to the problem of multi-class classification of mental health issues is to identify the cause behind the user’s intention. However, multi-class causal categorization for mental health issues on social media has a major challenge of wrong prediction due to the overlapping problem of causal explanations. There are two possible mitigation techniques to solve this problem: (i) Inconsistency among causal explanations/ inappropriate human-annotated inferences in the dataset, (ii) in-depth analysis of arguments and stances in self-reported text using discourse analysis. In this research work, we hypothesise that if there exists the inconsistency among F1 scores of different classes, there must be inconsistency among corresponding causal explanations as well. In this task, we fine tune the classifiers and find explanations for multi-class causal categorization of mental illness on social media with LIME and Integrated Gradient (IG) methods. We test our methods with CAMS dataset and validate with annotated interpretations. A key contribution of this research work is to find the reason behind inconsistency in accuracy of multi-class causal categorization. The effectiveness of our methods is evident with the results obtained having category-wise average scores of 81.29 % and 0.906 using cosine similarity and word mover’s distance, respectively. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2023,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),13624 LNCS,,172-183,,10.1007/978-3-031-30108-7_15,,#1135,Saxena 2023,"",""
"Virtually screening adults for depression, anxiety, and suicide risk using machine learning and language from an open-ended interview","Wright-Berryman, J.; Cohen, J.; Haq, A.; Black, D.P.; Pease, J.L.","Background: Current depression, anxiety, and suicide screening techniques rely on retrospective patient reported symptoms to standardized scales. A qualitative approach to screening combined with the innovation of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) methods have shown promise to enhance person-centeredness while detecting depression, anxiety, and suicide risk from in-the-moment patient language derived from an open-ended brief interview. Objective: To evaluate the performance of NLP/ML models to identify depression, anxiety, and suicide risk from a single 5–10-min semi-structured interview with a large, national sample. Method: Two thousand four hundred sixteen interviews were conducted with 1,433 participants over a teleconference platform, with 861 (35.6%), 863 (35.7%), and 838 (34.7%) sessions screening positive for depression, anxiety, and suicide risk, respectively. Participants completed an interview over a teleconference platform to collect language about the participants’ feelings and emotional state. Logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) models were trained for each condition using term frequency-inverse document frequency features from the participants’ language. Models were primarily evaluated with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: The best discriminative ability was found when identifying depression with an SVM model (AUC = 0.77; 95% CI = 0.75–0.79), followed by anxiety with an LR model (AUC = 0.74; 95% CI = 0.72–0.76), and an SVM for suicide risk (AUC = 0.70; 95% CI = 0.68–0.72). Model performance was generally best with more severe depression, anxiety, or suicide risk. Performance improved when individuals with lifetime but no suicide risk in the past 3 months were considered controls. Conclusion: It is feasible to use a virtual platform to simultaneously screen for depression, anxiety, and suicide risk using a 5-to-10-min interview. The NLP/ML models performed with good discrimination in the identification of depression, anxiety, and suicide risk. Although the utility of suicide risk classification in clinical settings is still undetermined and suicide risk classification had the lowest performance, the result taken together with the qualitative responses from the interview can better inform clinical decision-making by providing additional drivers associated with suicide risk.

Differentially Private Recurrent Variational Autoencoder For Text Privacy Preservation,"Wang, Y.; Meng, X.; Liu, X.","Deep learning techniques have been widely used in natural language processing (NLP) tasks and have made remarkable progress. However, training the deep learning model relies on a large amount of data which may involve sensitive information like electronic medical records. The attacker can infer sensitive information from the model, which leads to privacy leakage. To solve this problem, we propose a Differentially Private Recurrent Variational AutoEncoder (DP-RVAE) that can generate simulated data in place of the sensitive dataset to preserve privacy. To generate high utility synthetic text, a part of sensitive text data is employed as the conditional input of the model and uses a dropout and noise perturbing mechanism to preserve differential privacy. In addition, we expand the proposed DP-RVAE to a federated learning setting and design a novel training paradigm for NLP tasks. Specifically, DP-RVAE is deployed to the client-side to train and generate personalized text. These DP-RVAE models would be aggregated and updated through the Federated Optimisation (FedOPT) algorithm so that personal information can be well preserved. We evaluate our proposed DP-RVAE through a text classification task on the Tweets depression sentiment and IMDB reviews datasets. Our DP-RVAE achieves a higher average test accuracy by 5.90% and 3.94% compared to the typical centralized training and federated learning approach, respectively. We also perform the keywords inference attack experiment on the medical description dataset collected from the real world. Compared to the typical differentially private preserving approach, the DP-RVAE decreases by 15.2% in average attack accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that DP-RVAE can be applied to the NLP models to leverage accuracy while preserving sensitive privacy. © 2023, The Author(s).",2023,,Mobile Networks and Applications,,,,,10.1007/s11036-023-02096-9,,#1148,Wang 2023,"",""
Using deep learning to analyze the psychological effects of COVID-19,"Almeqren, M.A.; Almuqren, L.; Alhayan, F.; Cristea, A.I.; Pennington, D.","Problem: Sentiment Analysis (SA) automates the classification of the sentiment of people’s attitudes, feelings or reviews employing natural language processing (NLP) and computational approaches. Deep learning has recently demonstrated remarkable success in the field of SA in many languages including Arabic. Arabic sentiment analysis, however, still has to be improved, due to the complexity of the Arabic language’s structure, the variety of dialects, and the lack of lexicons. Moreover, in Arabic, anxiety as a psychological sentiment has not been the target of much research. Aim: This paper aims to provide solutions to one of the challenges of Arabic Sentiment Analysis (ASA) using a deep learning model focused on predicting the anxiety level during COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia. Methods: A psychological scale to determine the level of anxiety was built and validated. It was then used to create the Arabic Psychological Lexicon (AraPh) containing 138 different dialectical Arabic words that express anxiety, which was used to annotate our corpus (Aranxiety). Aranxiety comprises 955 Arabic tweets representing the level of user anxiety during COVID-19. Bi-GRU model with word embedding was then applied to analyze the sentiment of the tweets and to determine the anxiety level. Results: For SA, the applied model achieved 88% on accuracy, 89% on precision, 88% on recall, and 87% for F1. A majority of 77% of tweets presented no anxiety, whereas 17% represented mild anxiety and a mere 6% represented high anxiety. Conclusion: The proposed model can be used by the Saudi Ministry of Health and members of the research community to formulate solutions to increase psychological resiliency among the Saudi population.

Collective events and individual affect shape autobiographical memory,"Rouhani, N.; Stanley, D.; Adolphs, R.","How do collective events shape how we remember our lives? We leveraged advances in natural language processing as well as a rich, longitudinal assessment of 1,000 Americans throughout 2020 to examine how memory is influenced by two prominent factors: surprise and emotion. Autobiographical memory for 2020 displayed a unique signature: There was a substantial bump in March, aligning with pandemic onset and lockdowns, consistent across three memory collections 1 y apart. We further investigated how emotion, using both immediate and retrieved measures, predicted the amount and content of autobiographical memory: Negative affect increased recall across all measures, whereas its more clinical indices, depression and posttraumatic stress disorder, selectively increased nonepisodic recall. Finally, in a separate cohort, we found pandemic news to be better remembered, surprising, and negative, while lockdowns compressed remembered time.

HICEM: A High-Coverage Emotion Model for Artificial Emotional Intelligence,"Wortman, B.; Wang, J.Z.","As social robots and other intelligent machines enter the home, artificial emotional intelligence (AEI) is taking center stage to address users&#x0027; desire for deeper, more meaningful human-machine interaction. To accomplish such efficacious interaction, the next-generation AEI needs comprehensive human emotion models for training. Unlike theory of emotion, which has been the historical focus in psychology, emotion models are a descriptive tool. In practice, the strongest models need robust coverage, which means defining the smallest core set of emotions from which all others can be derived. To achieve the desired coverage, we turn to word embeddings from natural language processing. Using unsupervised clustering techniques, our experiments show that with as few as 15 discrete emotion categories, we can provide maximum coverage across six major languages&#x2013;Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Spanish, and Russian. In support of our findings, we also examine annotations from two large-scale emotion recognition datasets to assess the validity of existing emotion models compared to human perception at scale. Because robust, comprehensive emotion models are foundational for developing real-world affective computing applications, this work has broad implications in social robotics, human-machine interaction, mental healthcare, computational psychology, and entertainment.

Automatic depression severity assessment with deep learning using parameter-efficient tuning,"Lau, C.; Zhu, X.; Chan, W.-Y.","Introduction: To assist mental health care providers with the assessment of depression, research to develop a standardized, accessible, and non-invasive technique has garnered considerable attention. Our study focuses on the application of deep learning models for automatic assessment of depression severity based on clinical interview transcriptions. Despite the recent success of deep learning, the lack of large-scale high-quality datasets is a major performance bottleneck for many mental health applications. Methods: A novel approach is proposed to address the data scarcity problem for depression assessment. It leverages both pretrained large language models and parameter-efficient tuning techniques. The approach is built upon adapting a small set of tunable parameters, known as prefix vectors, to guide a pretrained model towards predicting the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-8 score of a person. Experiments were conducted on the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus - Wizard of Oz (DAIC-WOZ) benchmark dataset with 189 subjects, partitioned into training, development, and test sets. Model learning was done on the training set. Prediction performance mean and standard deviation of each model, with five randomly-initialized runs, were reported on the development set. Finally, optimized models were evaluated on the test set. Results: The proposed model with prefix vectors outperformed all previously published methods, including models which utilized multiple types of data modalities, and achieved the best reported performance on the test set of DAIC-WOZ with a root mean square error of 4.67 and a mean absolute error of 3.80 on the PHQ-8 scale. Compared to conventionally fine-tuned baseline models, prefix-enhanced models were less prone to overfitting by using far fewer training parameters (<6% relatively). Discussion: While transfer learning through pretrained large language models can provide a good starting point for downstream learning, prefix vectors can further adapt the pretrained models effectively to the depression assessment task by only adjusting a small number of parameters. The improvement is in part due to the fine-grain flexibility of prefix vector size in adjusting the model's learning capacity. Our results provide evidence that prefix-tuning can be a useful approach in developing tools for automatic depression assessment.

Beyond human expertise: the promise and limitations of ChatGPT in suicide risk assessment,"Elyoseph, Z.; Levkovich, I.","ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence language model developed by OpenAI, holds the potential for contributing to the field of mental health.

To address this knowledge gap, this study aims to compare ChatGPT’s assessments of mental health indicators to those of mental health professionals in a hypothetical case study that focuses on suicide risk assessment. Specifically, ChatGPT was asked to evaluate a text vignette describing a hypothetical patient with varying levels of perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness. The ChatGPT assessments were compared to the norms of mental health professionals. The results indicated that ChatGPT rated the risk of suicide attempts lower than did the mental health professionals in all conditions. Furthermore, ChatGPT rated mental resilience lower than the norms in most conditions. These results imply that gatekeepers, patients or even mental health professionals who rely on ChatGPT for evaluating suicidal risk or as a complementary tool to improve decision-making may receive an inaccurate assessment that underestimates the actual suicide risk.

A Transformer-CNN Hybrid Model for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in Psychological Assessment and Intervention for Enhanced Diagnostic Accuracy and Treatment Efficiency,"Vuyyuru, V.A.; Krishna, G.V.; Mary, S.S.C.; Kayalvili, S.; Alsubayhay, A.M.S.","The use of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) as a method for psychological assessment and intervention has shown to be quite successful. However, by utilizing advancements in artificial intelligence and natural language processing techniques, the diagnostic precision and therapeutic efficacy of CBT can be significantly improved. For CBT in psychological evaluation and intervention, we suggest a unique Transformer-CNN hybrid model in this work. The hybrid model combines the strengths of the Transformer and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. While the CNN model successfully extracts local and global features from the input sequences, the Transformer model accurately captures the contextual dependencies and semantic linkages in the text data. It intends to enhance the model's comprehension and interpretation of the complex linguistic patterns involved in psychological evaluation and intervention by merging these two algorithms. On a sizable collection of clinical text data, which includes patient narratives, treatment transcripts, and diagnostic reports, we undertake comprehensive experiments. The proposed Trans-CNN hybrid model outperformed all other methods with an impressive accuracy of 97%. In diagnosing psychiatric problems, the model shows improved diagnosis accuracy and offers more effective therapy advice. Our hybrid model's automatic real-time monitoring and feedback capabilities also make it possible for prompt intervention and customized care during therapy sessions. By giving doctors a formidable tool for precise evaluation and efficient intervention, the suggested approach has the potential to revolutionize the field of CBT and enhance patient outcomes for mental health.

Natural language processing, automatic, and lexicon-based methods were employed to perform sentiment analysis and identify depression and anxiety-loaded content. Methods: Data was collected from 187 Reddit users who had received a cancer diagnosis, were currently undergoing treatment, or had completed treatment. Participants were split according to survivorship status into short-term, transition, and long-term cancer survivors. A total of 72524 posts were analyzed across the three cancer survivor groups. Results: The results showed that short-term cancer survivors had significantly more depression-loaded posts and more anxiety-loaded words than long-term survivors, with no significant differences relative to the transition period. The topic analysis showed that long-term survivors, more than other stages of survivorship, have resources to share their experiences with suicidal ideation and mental health issues while providing support to their survivor community. Discussion: The results indicate that Reddit texts seem to be an indicator of when the stressor is active and mental health issues are triggered.

Using Machine Learning of Online Expression to Explain Recovery Trajectories: Content Analytic Approach to Studying a Substance Use Disorder Forum,"Yang, E.F.; Kornfield, R.; Liu, Y.; Chih, M.-Y.; Sarma, P.; Gustafson, D.; Curtin, J.; Shah, D.","Background: Smartphone-based apps are increasingly used to prevent relapse among those with substance use disorders (SUDs). These systems collect a wealth of data from participants, including the content of messages exchanged in peer-to-peer support forums. How individuals self-disclose and exchange social support in these forums may provide insight into their recovery course, but a manual review of a large corpus of text by human coders is inefficient. Objective: The study sought to evaluate the feasibility of applying supervised machine learning (ML) to perform large-scale content analysis of an online peer-to-peer discussion forum. Machine-coded data were also used to understand how communication styles relate to writers’ substance use and well-being outcomes. Methods: Data were collected from a smartphone app that connects patients with SUDs to online peer support via a discussion forum. Overall, 268 adult patients with SUD diagnoses were recruited from 3 federally qualified health centers in the United States beginning in 2014. Two waves of survey data were collected to measure demographic characteristics and study outcomes: at baseline (before accessing the app) and after 6 months of using the app. Messages were downloaded from the peer-to-peer forum and subjected to manual content analysis. These data were used to train supervised ML algorithms using features extracted from the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) system to automatically identify the types of expression relevant to peer-to-peer support. Regression analyses examined how each expression type was associated with recovery outcomes. Results: Our manual content analysis identified 7 expression types relevant to the recovery process (emotional support, informational support, negative affect, change talk, insightful disclosure, gratitude, and universality disclosure). Over 6 months of app use, 86.2% (231/268) of participants posted on the app’s support forum. Of these participants, 93.5% (216/231) posted at least 1 message in the content categories of interest, generating 10,503 messages. Supervised ML algorithms were trained on the hand-coded data, achieving F1-scores ranging from 0.57 to 0.85. Regression analyses revealed that a greater proportion of the messages giving emotional support to peers was related to reduced substance use. For self-disclosure, a greater proportion of the messages expressing universality was related to improved quality of life, whereas a greater proportion of the negative affect expressions was negatively related to quality of life and mood. Conclusions: This study highlights a method of natural language processing with potential to provide real-time insights into peer-to-peer communication dynamics. First, we found that our ML approach allowed for large-scale content coding while retaining moderate-to-high levels of accuracy. Second, individuals’ expression styles were associated with recovery outcomes. The expression types of emotional support, universality disclosure, and negative affect were significantly related to recovery outcomes, and attending to these dynamics may be important for appropriate intervention. ©Ellie Fan Yang, Rachel Kornfield, Yan Liu, Ming-Yuan Chih, Prathusha Sarma, David Gustafson, John Curtin, Dhavan Shah.",2023,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,25,,,,10.2196/45589,,#1189,Yang 2023,"",""
Personality Assessment Based on Natural Stream of Thoughts Empowered with Machine Learning,"Salahat, M.; Ali, L.; Ghazal, T.M.; Alzoubi, H.M.","Knowing each other is obligatory in a multi-agent collaborative environment. Collaborators may develop the desired know-how of each other in various aspects such as habits, job roles, status, and behaviors. Among different distinguishing characteristics related to a person, personality traits are an effective predictive tool for an individual’s behavioral pattern. It has been observed that when people are asked to share their details through questionnaires, they intentionally or unintentionally become biased. They knowingly or unknowingly provide enough information in much-unbiased comportment in open writing about themselves. Such writings can effectively assess an individual’s personality traits that may yield enormous possibilities for applications such as forensic departments, job interviews, mental health diagnoses, etc. Stream of consciousness, collected by James Pennbaker and Laura King, is one such way of writing, referring to a narrative technique where the emotions and thoughts of the writer are presented in a way that brings the reader to the fluid through the mental states of the narrator.

Models of Gender Dysphoria Using Social Media Data for Use in Technology-Delivered Interventions: Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing Validation Study,"Cascalheira, C.J.; Flinn, R.E.; Zhao, Y.; Klooster, D.; Laprade, D.; Hamdi, S.M.; Scheer, J.R.; Gonzalez, A.; Lund, E.M.; Gomez, I.N.; Saha, K.; De Choudhury, M.","Background: The optimal treatment for gender dysphoria is medical intervention, but many transgender and nonbinary people face significant treatment barriers when seeking help for gender dysphoria. When untreated, gender dysphoria is associated with depression, anxiety, suicidality, and substance misuse. Technology-delivered interventions for transgender and nonbinary people can be used discretely, safely, and flexibly, thereby reducing treatment barriers and increasing access to psychological interventions to manage distress that accompanies gender dysphoria. Technology-delivered interventions are beginning to incorporate machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) to automate intervention components and tailor intervention content. A critical step in using ML and NLP in technology-delivered interventions is demonstrating how accurately these methods model clinical constructs. Objective: This study aimed to determine the preliminary effectiveness of modeling gender dysphoria with ML and NLP, using transgender and nonbinary people’s social media data. Methods: Overall, 6 ML models and 949 NLP-generated independent variables were used to model gender dysphoria from the text data of 1573 Reddit (Reddit Inc) posts created on transgender- and nonbinary-specific web-based forums. After developing a codebook grounded in clinical science, a research team of clinicians and students experienced in working with transgender and nonbinary clients used qualitative content analysis to determine whether gender dysphoria was present in each Reddit post (ie, the dependent variable). NLP (eg, n-grams, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, word embedding, sentiment, and transfer learning) was used to transform the linguistic content of each post into predictors for ML algorithms. A k-fold cross-validation was performed. Hyperparameters were tuned with random search. Feature selection was performed to demonstrate the relative importance of each NLP-generated independent variable in predicting gender dysphoria. Misclassified posts were analyzed to improve future modeling of gender dysphoria. Results: Results indicated that a supervised ML algorithm (ie, optimized extreme gradient boosting [XGBoost]) modeled gender dysphoria with a high degree of accuracy (0.84), precision (0.83), and speed (1.23 seconds). Of the NLP-generated independent variables, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) clinical keywords (eg, dysphoria and disorder) were most predictive of gender dysphoria. Misclassifications of gender dysphoria were common in posts that expressed uncertainty, featured a stressful experience unrelated to gender dysphoria, were incorrectly coded, expressed insufficient linguistic markers of gender dysphoria, described past experiences of gender dysphoria, showed evidence of identity exploration, expressed aspects of human sexuality unrelated to gender dysphoria, described socially based gender dysphoria, expressed strong affective or cognitive reactions unrelated to gender dysphoria, or discussed body image. Conclusions: Findings suggest that ML- and NLP-based models of gender dysphoria have significant potential to be integrated into technology-delivered interventions.

An analysis of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome Reddit posts and themes,"Wightman, R.S.; Perrone, J.; Collins, A.B.; Lakamana, S.; Sarker, A.","Introduction: Reddit hosts a large active community of members dedicated to the discussion of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome. We sought to describe common themes discussed and the most frequently mentioned triggers and therapies for cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome exacerbations in the Reddit online community. Methods: Data collected from six subreddits were filtered using natural language processing to curate posts referencing cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome. Based on a manual review of posts, common themes were identified. A machine learning model was trained using the manually categorized data to automatically classify the themes for the rest of the posts so that their distributions could be quantified. Results: From August 2018 to November 2022, 2683 unique posts were collected. Thematic analysis resulted in five overall themes: cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome-related science; symptom timing; cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome treatment and prevention; cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome diagnosis and education; and health impacts. Additionally, 447 trigger and 664 therapy-related posts were identified. The most commonly mentioned triggers for cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome episodes included: food and drink (n = 62), cannabinoids (n = 45), mental health (e.g., stress, anxiety) (n = 27), and alcohol (n = 22). Most commonly mentioned cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome therapies included: hot water/bathing (n = 62), hydration (n = 60), antiemetics (n = 42), food and drink (n = 38), gastrointestinal medications (n = 38), behavioral therapies (e.g., meditation, yoga) (n = 35), and capsaicin (n = 29). Discussion: Reddit posts for cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome provide a valuable source of community discussion and individual reports of people experiencing cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome. Mental health and alcohol were frequently reported triggers within the posts but are not often identified in the literature. While many of the therapies mentioned are well documented, behavioral responses such as meditation and yoga have not been explored by the scientific literature. Conclusions: Knowledge shared via online social media platforms contains detailed information on self-reported cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome disease and management experiences, which could serve as valuable data for the development of treatment strategies. Further longitudinal studies in patients with cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome are needed to corroborate these findings. © 2023 The Author(s).

The Perception of Epidemic Situation Amongst Coaching and Mentoring Professionals: An Emotional Analysis Approach,"Kahyaoglu, S.B.; Kadilar, R.","In this paper, the perception of COVID-19 situation amongst coaching, mentoring, and supervision practitioners is analyzed based on the survey conducted by European Mentoring Coaching Council (EMCC Global) with the participation of (476) people from various countries. Based on the data obtained, ‘word cluster analysis-emotional text mining’ and ‘correlation analysis’ are performed. The major empirical findings are summarized as follows: firstly, correlations are calculated among the most repetitive words in the statements of participants by using the Euclidian distance approach. In this respect, participants describe COVID-19 related feelings with the most frequent words they use as coaching, work, anxiety, clients, working, fear, time, business, home, and stress respectively. This indicates that COVID-19 epidemic related issues leads participants to think about their clients. They have the most common feelings of anxiety, stress, and fear at work, business and home. They are sensitive about the time as well. Secondly, cluster dendrogram is applied and this indicates that there are five major categories defined with strong correlation between them such that: coaching, work, anxiety, change, issues, crisis, will, managing, new, people, management, client, working, fear, uncertainty, future, time, stress, business, home. In conclusion, policy recommendations are made regarding the pandemic period all over the world in order to contribute relevant literature based on the empirical findings of EMCC Global’s survey. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",2023,,"Accounting, Finance, Sustainability, Governance and Fraud",,,169-184,,10.1007/978-981-19-9079-3_9,,#1211,Kahyaoglu 2023,"",""
Predicting health-related quality of life change using natural language processing in thyroid cancer,"Lian, R.; Hsiao, V.; Hwang, J.; Ou, Y.; Robbins, S.E.; Connor, N.P.; Macdonald, C.L.; Sippel, R.S.; Sethares, W.A.; Schneider, D.F.","Background: Patient-reported outcomes (PRO) allow clinicians to measure health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and understand patients’ treatment priorities, but obtaining PRO requires surveys which are not part of routine care. We aimed to develop a preliminary natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to extract HRQOL trajectory based on deep learning models using patient language. Materials and methods: Our data consisted of transcribed interviews of 100 patients undergoing surgical intervention for low-risk thyroid cancer, paired with HRQOL assessments completed during the same visits. Our outcome measure was HRQOL trajectory measured by the SF-12 physical and mental component scores (PCS and MCS), and average THYCA-QoL score. We constructed an NLP pipeline based on BERT, a modern deep language model that captures context semantics, to predict HRQOL trajectory as measured by the above endpoints. We compared this to baseline models using logistic regression and support vector machines trained on bag-of-words representations of transcripts obtained using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC). Finally, given the modest dataset size, we implemented two data augmentation methods to improve performance: first by generating synthetic samples via GPT-2, and second by changing the representation of available data via sequence-by-sequence pairing, which is a novel approach. Results: A BERT-based deep learning model, with GPT-2 synthetic sample augmentation, demonstrated an area-under-curve of 76.3% in the classification of HRQOL accuracy as measured by PCS, compared to the baseline logistic regression and bag-of-words model, which had an AUC of 59.9%. The sequence-by-sequence pairing method for augmentation had an AUC of 71.2% when used with the BERT model. Conclusions: NLP methods show promise in extracting PRO from unstructured narrative data, and in the future may aid in assessing and forecasting patients’ HRQOL in response to medical treatments. Our experiments with optimization methods suggest larger amounts of novel data would further improve performance of the classification model. © 2023",2023,,Intelligence-Based Medicine,7,,,,10.1016/j.ibmed.2023.100097,,#1213,Lian 2023,"",""
A practical approach to identifying autistic adults within the electronic health record,"Malow, B.A.; Veatch, O.J.; Niu, X.; Fitzpatrick, K.A.; Hucks, D.; Maxwell-Horn, A.; Davis, L.K.","The electronic health record (EHR) provides valuable data for understanding physical and mental health conditions in autism. We developed an approach to identify charts of autistic young adults, retrieved from our institution's de-identified EHR database. Clinical notes within two cohorts were identified. Cohort 1 charts had at least one International Classification of Diseases (ICD-CM) autism code. Cohort 2 charts had only autism key terms without ICD-CM codes, and at least four notes per chart. A natural language processing tool parsed medical charts to identify key terms associated with autism diagnoses and mapped them to Unified Medical Language System Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs). Average scores were calculated for each set of charts based on captured CUIs. Chart review determined whether patients met criteria for autism using a classification rubric. In Cohort 1, of 418 patients, 361 were confirmed to have autism by chart review. Sensitivity was 0.99 and specificity was 0.68 with positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.97. Specificity improved to 0.81 (sensitivity was 0.95; PPV was 0.98) when the number of notes was limited to four or more per chart. In Cohort 2, 48 of 136 patients were confirmed to have autism by chart review. Sensitivity was 0.95, specificity was 0.73, and PPV was 0.70. Our approach, which included using key terms, identified autism charts with high sensitivity, even in the absence of ICD-CM codes. Relying on ICD-CM codes alone may result in inclusion of false positive cases and exclusion of true cases with autism. © 2022 International Society for Autism Research and Wiley Periodicals LLC.",2023,,Autism Research,16,1,52-65,,10.1002/aur.2849,,#1215,Malow 2023,"",""
Digital hermeneutics: Scaled readings of online depression discourses,"Van De Ven, I.; Van Nuenen, T.","When it comes to understanding experiences of illness, humanities and social sciences research have traditionally reserved a prominent role for narrative. Yet, depression has characteristics that withstand the form of traditional narratives, such as a lack of desire and an impotence to act. How can a 'datafied' approach to online forms of depression writing pose a valuable addition to existing narrative approaches in health humanities' In this article, we analyse lay people's depression discourses online. Our approach, 'digital hermeneutics', is inspired by Gadamer's dialogical hermeneutics. It consists of a 'scaled reading' on five different scales: platform hermeneutics; contextual reading with term frequency - inverse document frequency (TF-IDF); distant reading with natural language processing topic modelling; hyper-reading with concordance views and close reading. Our corpus consisted of three data sets, from the blogs and message boards of, respectively, time-to-change.org.uk, a UK-based social organisation and movement that aims to counter mental health discrimination and alleviate social isolation by spreading awareness; Sane.org.uk, a leading UK mental health charity that seeks to help people in facing the challenges of mental illness and to improve quality of life; and the subreddit 'r/depression' on web discussion platform reddit. We found that the manner in which people express experiences of illness online is very much dependent on the specific affordances of platforms. We found degrees of 'narrativity' to be correlated to authorship and identity markers: the less 'anonymous' the writing, generally speaking, the more conventionally 'narrative' it was. Pseudonimity was related to more intimate and singular forms, with less pressure to conform to socially accepted and positive narratives of the 'restitution' type. We also found that interactive affordances of the platforms were used to a limited extent, nuancing assumptions about the polyvocality of online depression writing. We conclude by making a claim for increased cooperation between digital and medical humanities that might lead to a field of 'Digital Medical Humanities'.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

SENTIMENTAL ANALYSIS OF COVID-19 TWITTER DATA USING DEEP LEARNING AND MACHINE LEARNING MODELS,"Darad, S.; Krishnan, S.","The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an ongoing pandemic with large global attention. However, spreading fake news on social media sites like Twitter is creating unnecessary anxiety and panic among people towards this disease. In this paper, we applied machine learning (ML) techniques to predict the sentiment of the people using social media such as Twitter during the COVID-19 peak in April 2021. The data contains tweets collected on the dates between 16 April 2021 and 26 April 2021 where the text of the tweets has been labelled by training the models with an already labelled dataset of corona virus tweets as positive, negative, and neutral. Sentiment analysis was conducted by a deep learning model known as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and various ML models for text analysis and performance which were then compared among each other. ML models used were Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Stochastic Gradient Descent and Extreme Gradient Boosting. Accuracy for every sentiment was separately calculated. The classification accuracies of all the ML models produced were 66.4%, 77.7%, 74.5%, 74.7%, 78.6%, and 75.5%, respectively and BERT model produced 84.2 %. Each sentiment-classified model has accuracy around or above 75%, which is a quite significant value in text mining algorithms. We could infer that most people tweeting are taking positive and neutral approaches. © 2023, Universidad Politecnica Salesiana.

EEGformer: A transformer–based brain activity classification method using EEG signal,"Wan, Z.; Li, M.; Liu, S.; Huang, J.; Tan, H.; Duan, W.","Background: The effective analysis methods for steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) signals are critical in supporting an early diagnosis of glaucoma. Most efforts focused on adopting existing techniques to the SSVEPs-based brain–computer interface (BCI) task rather than proposing new ones specifically suited to the domain. Method: Given that electroencephalogram (EEG) signals possess temporal, regional, and synchronous characteristics of brain activity, we proposed a transformer–based EEG analysis model known as EEGformer to capture the EEG characteristics in a unified manner. We adopted a one-dimensional convolution neural network (1DCNN) to automatically extract EEG-channel-wise features. The output was fed into the EEGformer, which is sequentially constructed using three components: regional, synchronous, and temporal transformers. In addition to using a large benchmark database (BETA) toward SSVEP-BCI application to validate model performance, we compared the EEGformer to current state-of-the-art deep learning models using two EEG datasets, which are obtained from our previous study: SJTU emotion EEG dataset (SEED) and a depressive EEG database (DepEEG). Results: The experimental results show that the EEGformer achieves the best classification performance across the three EEG datasets, indicating that the rationality of our model architecture and learning EEG characteristics in a unified manner can improve model classification performance. Conclusion: EEGformer generalizes well to different EEG datasets, demonstrating our approach can be potentially suitable for providing accurate brain activity classification and being used in different application scenarios, such as SSVEP-based early glaucoma diagnosis, emotion recognition and depression discrimination.

Application of NLP and Machine Learning for Mental Health Improvement,"Borah, T.; Ganesh Kumar, S.","Humans’ most powerful tool is their mental wellness. Individuals’ well-being can be impacted by poor mental health. This paper focuses on a smart technical solution to the problem of mental health issues detection related to the stress, sadness, depression, anxiety, etc. which if not handled efficiently may further lead to a severe problem. The paper deals with the designing of an automated smart system using social media posts that will help mental health experts to successfully identify and understand about the mental health condition of social media users. That can be done based on text analysis of rich social media resources such as Reddit, Twitter posts. The implementation of the system is done using Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, machine learning and deep learning algorithms. The models are trained using a prepared dataset of social media postings. With this automated system the mental health experts can able to detect the stress or some other emotions of social media uses in a very earlier as well as faster way. The proposed system can predict five emotional categories: ‘Happy’, ‘Angry’, ‘Surprise’, ‘Sad’, ‘Fear’ based on machine learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM), deep learning Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and BERT transfer learning algorithms. All the applied algorithms are evaluated using confusion matrix, the highest accuracy and f1 score achieved is more than 85%, which is better than the existing human emotion detection systems. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",2023,,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,492,,219-228,,10.1007/978-981-19-3679-1_16,,#1223,Borah 2023,"",""
Weighted Voting Ensemble for Depressive Disorder Analysis with Multi-objective Optimization,"Nuankaew, W.; Nuankaew, P.; Doenribram, D.; Jareanpon, C.","The Twitter platform is a popular tool that is widely used by researchers to collect data on users’ personal lives, feelings and emotions. These data sets can be further analyzed using text mining techniques to predict the disorder of depression. There are nine symptoms of depression that are classified by American Psychiatric Association using DSM-5 criteria. The symptoms can be difficult to identify effectively. The unweighted vote ensemble is not practical for multi-class data. Therefore, this research proposes the multi-objective optimization algorithms for depressive symptom prediction modeling (MOADSP) for the weighted voting ensemble, which can improve its effectiveness compared to the singer model. The objectives of this research were 1) to find the appropriate number of features; 2) to improve the weights of the prediction models based on the recall of the class for the ensemble; and 3) to compare the performance of the single, unweighted, and weighted voting ensemble models for depressive disorder. An information gain was used to select the features. The single classification techniques used in the experiment that had their frameworks tested were the Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, and K-Nearest techniques, while the vote ensemble models used were the unweighted and weighted models. MOADSP was applied to the weighted vote ensemble models. The results showed that the best recall classifier was KNN (98.60%), and the highest recall classifier was AVG TP weighted (98.43%) for the training model. The highest recall in the class depressive classifier was AVG TP weighted (80.00%) for the testing. This proposed method was beneficial for the prediction of depressive disorder. © 2023, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang.

Revealing the Roles of Part-of-Speech Taggers in Alzheimer Disease Detection: Scientific Discovery Using One-Intervention Causal Explanation,"Wen, B.; Wang, N.; Subbalakshmi, K.; Chandramouli, R.","Background: Recently, rich computational methods that use deep learning or machine learning have been developed using linguistic biomarkers for the diagnosis of early-stage Alzheimer disease (AD). Moreover, some qualitative and quantitative studies have indicated that certain part-of-speech (PoS) features or tags could be good indicators of AD. However, there has not been a systematic attempt to discover the underlying relationships between PoS features and AD. Moreover, there has not been any attempt to quantify the relative importance of PoS features in detecting AD. Objective: Our goal was to disclose the underlying relationship between PoS features and AD, understand whether PoS features are useful in AD diagnosis, and explore which PoS features play a vital role in the diagnosis. Methods: The DementiaBank, containing 1049 transcripts from 208 patients with AD and 243 transcripts from 104 older control individuals, was used. A total of 27 PoS features were extracted from each record. Then, the relationship between AD and each of the PoS features was explored. A transformer-based deep learning model for AD prediction using PoS features was trained. Then, a global explainable artificial intelligence method was proposed and used to discover which PoS features were the most important in AD diagnosis using the transformer-based predictor. A global (model-level) feature importance measure was derived as a summary from the local (example-level) feature importance metric, which was obtained using the proposed causally aware counterfactual explanation method. The unique feature of this method is that it considers causal relations among PoS features and can, hence, preclude counterfactuals that are improbable and result in more reliable explanations. Results: The deep learning–based AD predictor achieved an accuracy of 92.2% and an F1-score of 0.955 when distinguishing patients with AD from healthy controls. The proposed explanation method identified 12 PoS features as being important for distinguishing patients with AD from healthy controls. Of these 12 features, 3 (25%) have been identified by other researchers in previous works in psychology and natural language processing. The remaining 75% (9/12) of PoS features have not been previously identified. We believe that this is an interesting finding that can be used in creating tests that might aid in the diagnosis of AD. Note that although our method is focused on PoS features, it should be possible to extend it to more types of features, perhaps even those derived from other biomarkers, such as syntactic features. Conclusions: The high classification accuracy of the proposed deep learner indicates that PoS features are strong clues in AD diagnosis. There are 12 PoS features that are strongly tied to AD, and because language is a noninvasive and potentially cheap method for detecting AD, this work shows some promising directions in this field. © Bingyang Wen, Ning Wang, Koduvayur Subbalakshmi, Rajarathnam Chandramouli.",2023,,JMIR Formative Research,7,,,,10.2196/36590,,#1227,Wen 2023,"",""
Predicting Generalized Anxiety Disorder From Impromptu Speech Transcripts Using Context-Aware Transformer-Based Neural Networks: Model Evaluation Study,"Teferra, B.G.; Rose, J.","Background: The ability to automatically detect anxiety disorders from speech could be useful as a screening tool for an anxiety disorder. Prior studies have shown that individual words in textual transcripts of speech have an association with anxiety severity. Transformer-based neural networks are models that have been recently shown to have powerful predictive capabilities based on the context of more than one input word. Transformers detect linguistic patterns and can be separately trained to make specific predictions based on these patterns. Objective: This study aimed to determine whether a transformer-based language model can be used to screen for generalized anxiety disorder from impromptu speech transcripts. Methods: A total of 2000 participants provided an impromptu speech sample in response to a modified version of the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). They also completed the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale. A transformer-based neural network model (pretrained on large textual corpora) was fine-tuned on the speech transcripts and the GAD-7 to predict whether a participant was above or below a screening threshold of the GAD-7. We reported the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) on the test data and compared the results with a baseline logistic regression model using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) features as input. Using the integrated gradient method to determine specific words that strongly affect the predictions, we inferred specific linguistic patterns that influence the predictions. Results: The baseline LIWC-based logistic regression model had an AUROC value of 0.58. The fine-tuned transformer model achieved an AUROC value of 0.64. Specific words that were often implicated in the predictions were also dependent on the context. For example, the first-person singular pronoun “I” influenced toward an anxious prediction 88% of the time and a nonanxious prediction 12% of the time, depending on the context. Silent pauses in speech, also often implicated in predictions, influenced toward an anxious prediction 20% of the time and a nonanxious prediction 80% of the time. Conclusions: There is evidence that a transformer-based neural network model has increased predictive power compared with the single word–based LIWC model. We also showed that the use of specific words in a specific context—a linguistic pattern—is part of the reason for the better prediction. This suggests that such transformer-based models could play a useful role in anxiety screening systems. © 2023 JMIR Publications.

A Study on Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data in Marathi Language for Measuring Depression,"Jakate, M.; Lavangare, S.; Bhoir, N.; Das, A.; Kadam, D.","Sentiment analysis is nothing but an information retrieval system based on natural language processing (NLP). It is a machine learning algorithm. The rudimentary prototype of sentiment analysis comes under the classifier problem where the negative, positive, and neutral are the classes we would be expecting as an output, given text (tweets in our case) as an input. Feature selection methods (information gain and chi square) and feature extraction will be performed to get the output sentiment. After studying three classifiers, support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbour (KNN), and Naive Bayes, the latter algorithm, i.e. Naive Bayes being most accurate among them would be considered for implementation. As mentioned, we would be focusing on major three output sentiment classes: positive, negative, and neutral. Further, we are getting into a detailed analysis of tweets reflecting a depressive state of mind due to sadness.

Topic modeling analysis was conducted through text mining using R. Five themes were found: “Changes in people’s everyday life,” “Socio-economic shock,” “Trends in infection,” “Role of the government and business,” and “Increased psychological anxiety,” which all showed sharp increases in articles from mid-February to early March and then decreased. Despite the increased psychological anxiety people suffered from the COVID-19 pandemic, this topic showed the fewest articles. “Changes in people’s everyday life” showed the most, focusing attention on stimulating lifestyle articles of general interest.

Questionnaires based on natural language processing elicit immersive ruminative thinking in ruminators: Evidence from behavioral responses and EEG data,"Li, Y.; Li, C.; Zhang, T.; Wu, L.; Lin, X.; Wang, L.; Yang, H.; Lu, D.; Miao, D.; Fang, P.","Rumination is closely related to mental disorders and can thus be used as a marker of their presence or a predictor of their development. The presence of masking and fabrication in psychological selection can lead to inaccurate detection of psychological disorders. Human language is considered crucial in eliciting specific conscious activities, and the use of natural language processing (NLP) in the development of questionnaires for psychological tests has the potential to elicit immersive ruminative thinking, leading to changes in neural activity. Electroencephalography (EEG) is commonly used to detect and record neural activity in the human brain and is sensitive to changes in brain activity. In this study, we used NLP to develop a questionnaire to induce ruminative thinking and then recorded the EEG signals in response to the questionnaire. The behavioral results revealed that ruminators exhibited higher arousal rates and longer reaction times, specifically in response to the ruminative items of the questionnaire. The EEG results showed no significant difference between the ruminators and the control group during the resting state; however, a significant alteration in the coherence of the entire brain of the ruminators existed while they were answering the ruminative items. No differences were found in the control participants while answering the two items. These behavioral and EEG results indicate that the questionnaire elicited immersive ruminative thinking, specifically in the ruminators. Therefore, the questionnaire designed using NLP is capable of eliciting ruminative thinking in ruminators, offering a promising approach for the early detection of mental disorders in psychological selection.

State and Federal Legislators’ Responses on Social Media to the Mental Health and Burnout of Health Care Workers Throughout the COVID-19 Pandemic: Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis,"Abrams, M.P.; Pelullo, A.P.; Meisel, Z.F.; Merchant, R.M.; Purtle, J.; Agarwal, A.K.","Background: Burnout and the mental health burden of the COVID-19 pandemic have disproportionately impacted health care workers. The links between state policies, federal regulations, COVID-19 case counts, strains on health care systems, and the mental health of health care workers continue to evolve. The language used by state and federal legislators in public-facing venues such as social media is important, as it impacts public opinion and behavior, and it also reflects current policy-leader opinions and planned legislation. Objective: The objective of this study was to examine legislators’ social media content on Twitter and Facebook throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to thematically characterize policy makers’ attitudes and perspectives related to mental health and burnout in the health care workforce. Methods: Legislators’ social media posts about mental health and burnout in the health care workforce were collected from January 2020 to November 2021 using Quorum, a digital database of policy-related documents. The total number of relevant social media posts per state legislator per calendar month was calculated and compared with COVID-19 case volume. Differences between themes expressed in Democratic and Republican posts were estimated using the Pearson chi-square test. Words within social media posts most associated with each political party were determined. Machine-learning was used to evaluate naturally occurring themes in the burnout- and mental health–related social media posts. Results: A total of 4165 social media posts (1400 tweets and 2765 Facebook posts) were generated by 2047 unique state and federal legislators and 38 government entities. The majority of posts (n=2319, 55.68%) were generated by Democrats, followed by Republicans (n=1600, 40.34%). Among both parties, the volume of burnout-related posts was greatest during the initial COVID-19 surge. However, there was significant variation in the themes expressed by the 2 major political parties. Themes most correlated with Democratic posts were (1) frontline care and burnout, (2) vaccines, (3) COVID-19 outbreaks, and (4) mental health services. Themes most correlated with Republican social media posts were (1) legislation, (2) call for local action, (3) government support, and (4) health care worker testing and mental health. Conclusions: State and federal legislators use social media to share opinions and thoughts on key topics, including burnout and mental health strain among health care workers. Variations in the volume of posts indicated that a focus on burnout and the mental health of the health care workforce existed early in the pandemic but has waned. Significant differences emerged in the content posted by the 2 major US political parties, underscoring how each prioritized different aspects of the crisis. © 2023 JMIR Publications Inc.

A Novel Machine Learning Classification Model to Analyze the COVID-19 Pandemic’s Impact on Academics: Sentiment Analysis Approach,"Mohan, S.; Singh, V.K.; Singh, N.; Ali, A.; Singh, P.","The COVID-19 Pandemic is considered as the worst situation for human beings; it affected people’s lives worldwide. Due to this pandemic, the respective government authority announced the lockdown to break the coronavirus chain. The lockdown impacted people’s mental health, leading to many psychological issues as well as hampered students’ academics. In this chapter we have studied the impacts on students’ academics due to lockdown effect. The data has been collected via a google form questionnaire circulated to various educational institutes. Further, we have developed a novel machine learning classifier model called Naïve Bayes-Support Vector Machine for analyzing the data, which utilizes the properties of both classifiers by using a deep learning framework. We have used natural language processing (TextBlob, Stanza and Vader) libraries to label the dataset and applied in the proposed NBSVM method and other machine learning models and classified the sentiments into two categories (Positive vs Negative). We also applied the natural language processing libraries used a topic-modelling technique called Latent Dirichlet Allocation to know the essential topics words of both classes from students’ feedback data. The study revealed 83% and 86% accuracy for unigram and bigram, respectively, whereas the precision was 79% and recall 81%. According to NLP libraries’ result, approximately 71% of the feedback’s sentiment is negative, and only 16% of feedbacks are positive.

BSAM: A BERT-Based Model with Statistical Information for Personality Prediction,"Xu, B.; Wang, T.; Gao, K.; Zhang, Z.","As a branch of psychology, personality plays an important role in distinguishing individuals in the society. The existing personality prediction models need to be further improved in precision and generalization. Recently, deep neural network (DNN) models are being applied to personality prediction tasks to obtain promising results. However, only extracting the semantic features of text through deep learning is very limited to improve the performance of the model. We propose a BERT-based Model for Personality Prediction named BSAM to extract semantic features and use the statistical information of corpus as external features. In this model, we concatenate the output of BERT with the statistical information and use bidirectional long short term memory networks (Bi-LSTM), bidirectional gated recurrent unit (Bi-GRU) and improved convolutional neural networks (CNN) to extract deep semantic features. We also compare the results with benchmark models on social media datasets and test the effectiveness of statistical features. The experimental results show that our model can effectively improve the classification performance of the five dimensions of the Big-Five personality. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2023,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),13422 LNCS,,538-545,,10.1007/978-3-031-25198-6_42,,#1250,Xu 2023,"",""
"An Examination of Eating Experiences in Relation to Psychological States, Loneliness, and Depression Using BERT","Nakai, K.; Iwai, R.; Kumada, T.","For humans, meals are significant, not only to intake nutrients or feel satisfaction but also to feel connected with family and society through interpersonal communication. This study aimed to estimate and examine the psychological states and traits of texts describing eating experiences using BERT. Texts about positive, negative, and neutral eating experiences were collected from 877 crowd workers along with their psychological traits (loneliness and depression). The accuracy of the 6-label classification of the three psychological states × two eating situations (co-eating or eating alone) was 72%. Although the accuracies of the binary classification of loneliness and depression are approximately 55%, they are comparable with those of crowd workers. These results suggest that estimating psychological traits is more difficult than estimating psychological states from a single text per crowd worker. Further analyses revealed that the fine-tuned BERT classifiers of psychological traits use language features different from those of human raters. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2023,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),13859 LNAI,,196-214,,10.1007/978-3-031-29168-5_14,,#1254,Nakai 2023,"",""
Depression Detection in Speech Using Transformer and Parallel Convolutional Neural Networks,"Yin, F.; Du, J.; Xu, X.; Zhao, L.","As a common mental disorder, depression becomes a major threat to human health and may even heavily influence one’s daily life. Considering this background, it is necessary to investigate strategies for automatically detecting depression, especially through the audio modality represented by speech segments, mainly due to the efficient latent information included in speech when describing depression. However, most of the existing works focus on stacking deep networks in audio-based depression detection, which may lead to insufficient knowledge for representing depression in speech. In this regard, we propose a deep learning model based on a parallel convolutional neural network and a transformer in order to mine effective information with an acceptable complexity. The proposed approach consists of a parallel convolutional neural network (parallel-CNN) module used to focus on local knowledge, while a transformer module is employed as the other parallel stream to perceive temporal sequential information using linear attention mechanisms with kernel functions. Then, we performed experiments on two datasets of Distress Analysis Interview Corpus-Wizard of OZ (DAIC-WOZ) and Multi-modal Open Dataset for Mental-disorder Analysis (MODMA). The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach achieves a better performance compared with the state-of-the-art strategies. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,,Electronics (Switzerland),12,2,,,10.3390/electronics12020328,,#1260,Yin 2023,"",""
Text Analysis of Trends in Health Equity and Disparities From the Internal Revenue Service Tax Documentation Submitted by US Nonprofit Hospitals Between 2010 and 2019: Exploratory Study,"Hadley, E.; Marcial, L.H.; Quattrone, W.; Bobashev, G.","Background: Many US hospitals are classified as nonprofits and receive tax-exempt status partially in exchange for providing benefits to the community. Proof of compliance is collected with the Schedule H form submitted as part of the annual Internal Revenue Service Form 990 (F990H), including a free-response text section that is known for being ambiguous and difficult to audit. This research is among the first to use natural language processing approaches to evaluate this text section with a focus on health equity and disparities. Objective: This study aims to determine the extent to which the free-response text in F990H reveals how nonprofit hospitals address health equity and disparities, including alignment with public priorities. Methods: We used free-response text submitted by hospital reporting entities in Part V and VI of the Internal Revenue Service Form 990 Schedule H between 2010 and 2019. We identified 29 main themes connected to health equity and disparities, and 152 related key phrases. We tallied occurrences of these phrases through term frequency analysis, calculated the Moran I statistic to assess geographic variation in 2018, analyzed Google Trends use for the same terms during the same period, and used semantic search with Sentence-BERT in Python to understand contextual use. Results: We found increased use from 2010 to 2019 across all the 29 phrase themes related to health equity and disparities. More than 90% of hospital reporting entities used terms in 2018 and 2019 related to affordability (2018: 2117/2131, 99.34%; 2019: 1620/1627, 99.57%), government organizations (2018: 2053/2131, 96.33%; 2019: 1577/1627, 96.93%), mental health (2018: 1937/2131, 90.9%; 2019: 1517/1627, 93.24%), and data collection (2018: 1947/2131, 91.37%; 2019: 1502/1627, 92.32%). The themes with the largest relative increase were LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer; 1676%; 2010: 12/2328, 0.51%; 2019: 149/1627, 9.16%) and social determinants of health (958%; 2010: 68/2328, 2.92%; 2019: 503/1627, 30.92%). Terms related to homelessness varied geographically from 2010 to 2018, and terms related to equity, health IT, immigration, LGBTQ, oral health, rural, social determinants of health, and substance use showed statistically significant (P < .05) geographic variation in 2018. The largest percentage point increase was for terms related to substance use (2010: 403/2328, 17.31%; 2019: 1149/1627, 70.62%). However, use in themes such as LGBTQ, disability, oral health, and race and ethnicity ranked lower than public interest in these topics, and some increased mentions of themes were to explicitly say that no action was taken. Conclusions: Hospital reporting entities demonstrate an increasing awareness of health equity and disparities in community benefit tax documentation, but these do not necessarily correspond with general population interests or additional action. We propose further investigation of alignment with community health needs assessments and make suggestions for improvements to F990H reporting requirements. © Emily Hadley, Laura Haak Marcial, Wes Quattrone, Georgiy Bobashev.

A machine learning approach to identifying suicide risk among text-based crisis counseling encounters,"Broadbent, M.; Medina Grespan, M.; Axford, K.; Zhang, X.; Srikumar, V.; Kious, B.; Imel, Z.","Introduction: With the increasing utilization of text-based suicide crisis counseling, new means of identifying at risk clients must be explored. Natural language processing (NLP) holds promise for evaluating the content of crisis counseling; here we use a data-driven approach to evaluate NLP methods in identifying client suicide risk. Methods: De-identified crisis counseling data from a regional text-based crisis encounter and mobile tipline application were used to evaluate two modeling approaches in classifying client suicide risk levels. A manual evaluation of model errors and system behavior was conducted. Results: The neural model outperformed a term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) model in the false-negative rate. While 75% of the neural model’s false negative encounters had some discussion of suicidality, 62.5% saw a resolution of the client’s initial concerns. Similarly, the neural model detected signals of suicidality in 60.6% of false-positive encounters. Discussion: The neural model demonstrated greater sensitivity in the detection of client suicide risk. A manual assessment of errors and model performance reflected these same findings, detecting higher levels of risk in many of the false-positive encounters and lower levels of risk in many of the false negatives. NLP-based models can detect the suicide risk of text-based crisis encounters from the encounter’s content.

A Multi-layered Deep Learning Approach for Human Stress Detection,"Soni, J.; Prabakar, N.; Upadhyay, H.","In today's fast-paced world, stress is common on various occasions in everyday life. However, long-term stress hinders normal lives. Detection of such mental stress at an earlier stage can prevent many associated health problems. There are significant changes in the multiple bio-signals, such as electrical, thermal, optical, etc., when an individual is under stress. Such bio-signals can be utilized to identify stress. In this paper, we propose a multi-layered deep learning-based approach for detecting human stress using the multimodal dataset. We use an open-source dataset, namely Wearable Stress and Affect Detection (WESAD), which contains data from wearable physiological and motion sensors. The modalities of these sensors include axis acceleration, body temperature, electrocardiogram, and electrodermal activity with three conditions: baseline, amusement, and stress. In the first layer of our multi-layered approach, we train and compare AutoEncoder and Variational AutoEncoder to learn the normal emotional state of the subject. In the second layer, we train and compare LSTM and Transformer models to classify the subjects as either in an amused or stressed state.

Supervised Relation Extraction Between Suicide-Related Entities and Drugs: Development and Usability Study of an Annotated PubMed Corpus,"Karapetian, K.; Jeon, S.M.; Kwon, J.-W.; Suh, Y.-K.","Background: Drug-induced suicide has been debated as a crucial issue in both clinical and public health research. Published research articles contain valuable data on the drugs associated with suicidal adverse events. An automated process that extracts such information and rapidly detects drugs related to suicide risk is essential but has not been well established. Moreover, few data sets are available for training and validating classification models on drug-induced suicide. Objective: This study aimed to build a corpus of drug-suicide relations containing annotated entities for drugs, suicidal adverse events, and their relations. To confirm the effectiveness of the drug-suicide relation corpus, we evaluated the performance of a relation classification model using the corpus in conjunction with various embeddings. Methods: We collected the abstracts and titles of research articles associated with drugs and suicide from PubMed and manually annotated them along with their relations at the sentence level (adverse drug events, treatment, suicide means, or miscellaneous). To reduce the manual annotation effort, we preliminarily selected sentences with a pretrained zero-shot classifier or sentences containing only drug and suicide keywords. We trained a relation classification model using various Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer embeddings with the proposed corpus. We then compared the performances of the model with different Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer-based embeddings and selected the most suitable embedding for our corpus. Results: Our corpus comprised 11,894 sentences extracted from the titles and abstracts of the PubMed research articles. Each sentence was annotated with drug and suicide entities and the relationship between these 2 entities (adverse drug events, treatment, means, and miscellaneous). All of the tested relation classification models that were fine-tuned on the corpus accurately detected sentences of suicidal adverse events regardless of their pretrained type and data set properties. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first and most extensive corpus of drug-suicide relations. © 2023 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Findings: Female graduate students post more than male students, and graduates majoring in chemistry post the most. Using the BiGRU-Attention model to identify and classify academic emotions has a performance with precision, recall and F1 score of more than 95%, the category of PA (Positive Activating) has the best classification performance. Through the analysis of post topics and keywords, the academic emotions of graduates mainly come from academic pressure, interpersonal relationships and career related.

We focused on major UK news channels, constructing a dataset of COVID-related news tweets (tweets from news organisations) and user comments made in response to these, covering Jan 2020 to April 2021. Natural language processing was used to analyse topics and levels of anger, joy, optimism, and sadness. Overall, sadness was the most prevalent emotion in the news tweets, but this was seen to decline over the timeframe under study. In contrast, amongst user tweets, anger was the overall most prevalent emotion. Time epochs were defined according to the time course of the UK social restrictions, and some interesting effects emerged regarding these. Further, correlation analysis revealed significant positive correlations between the emotions in the news tweets and the emotions expressed amongst the user tweets made in response, across all channels studied. Results provide unique insight onto how the dominant emotions present in UK news and user tweets evolved as the pandemic unfolded.

Sentiment Analysis with Neural Models for Hungarian,"Laki, L.J.; Yang, Z.G.","Sentiment analysis is a powerful tool to gain insight into the emotional polarity of opinionated texts. Computerized applications can contribute to the establishment of next-generation models that can provide us with data of unprecedented quantity and quality. However, these models often require substantial amount of resources in order to meet the desired performance expectations. Therefore, numerous research efforts are targeted to achieve high-quality results while lowering the resource needs by improving the structure and function of the models used. From a cognitive perspective, it is important to understand the mental state of users when they engage in activities that potentially reflect their feelings and emotions. With the emergence of the widespread use of digital solutions, users post opinionated texts on social media, which can be used as a valuable source to detect their underlying sentiments. Therefore, these platforms offer an unparalleled opportunity to perform sentiment analysis. In recent years, natural language processing tasks, like sentiment analysis, can be solved with high performance, if a pre-trained language model is fine-tuned. Herein we present the first neural transformer-based sentiment analysis model for Hungarian, which achieved state-of-the-art performance. Several limitation factors can occur during fine-tuning, such as the lack of training corpora with appropriate size or the complete absence of usable training material. In our experiment, we use data augmentation methods, specifically machine translation and cross-lingual transfer, to increase the size of our training corpora. Here, we demonstrate our experimentation with 9 different language models. Our work provides evidence for the increased efficiency of the trained models if translation text is added to the training corpora. Furthermore, using the augmentation technique, we could further increase the performance of our models.

Transferability Based on Drug Structure Similarity in the Automatic Classification of Noncompliant Drug Use on Social Media: Natural Language Processing Approach,"Nishiyama, T.; Yada, S.; Wakamiya, S.; Hori, S.; Aramaki, E.","Background: Medication noncompliance is a critical issue because of the increased number of drugs sold on the web. Web-based drug distribution is difficult to control, causing problems such as drug noncompliance and abuse. The existing medication compliance surveys lack completeness because it is impossible to cover patients who do not go to the hospital or provide accurate information to their doctors, so a social media–based approach is being explored to collect information about drug use. Social media data, which includes information on drug usage by users, can be used to detect drug abuse and medication compliance in patients. Objective: This study aimed to assess how the structural similarity of drugs affects the efficiency of machine learning models for text classification of drug noncompliance. Methods: This study analyzed 22,022 tweets about 20 different drugs. The tweets were labeled as either noncompliant use or mention, noncompliant sales, general use, or general mention. The study compares 2 methods for training machine learning models for text classification: single-sub-corpus transfer learning, in which a model is trained on tweets about a single drug and then tested on tweets about other drugs, and multi-sub-corpus incremental learning, in which models are trained on tweets about drugs in order of their structural similarity. The performance of a machine learning model trained on a single subcorpus (a data set of tweets about a specific category of drugs) was compared to the performance of a model trained on multiple subcorpora (data sets of tweets about multiple categories of drugs). Results: The results showed that the performance of the model trained on a single subcorpus varied depending on the specific drug used for training. The Tanimoto similarity (a measure of the structural similarity between compounds) was weakly correlated with the classification results. The model trained by transfer learning a corpus of drugs with close structural similarity performed better than the model trained by randomly adding a subcorpus when the number of subcorpora was small. Conclusions: The results suggest that structural similarity improves the classification performance of messages about unknown drugs if the drugs in the training corpus are few. On the other hand, this indicates that there is little need to consider the influence of the Tanimoto structural similarity if a sufficient variety of drugs are ensured. © Tomohiro Nishiyama, Shuntaro Yada, Shoko Wakamiya, Satoko Hori, Eiji Aramaki.",2023,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,25,,,,10.2196/44870,,#1288,Nishiyama 2023,"",""

Customized Training of Pretrained Language Models to Detect Post Intents in Online Health Support Groups,"Giyahchi, T.; Singh, S.; Harris, I.; Pechmann, C.","Online support groups offer low-cost and accessible health and mental health support, but low engagement challenges their effectiveness.

We then train and examine models to predict the intent behind each post. To reduce the effect of noisy and sparse data, we fine-tune a massive pretrained language model. Also, to represent the unique relationships between intents, we design customized loss functions for training. Empirical evaluations show significant performance improvements with the proposed method; our best model obtains 95.5% accuracy.

EliteVec: Feature Fusion for Depression Diagnosis Using Optimized Long Short-Term Memory Network,"Kavi Priya, S.; Pon Karthika, K.","Globally, depression is perceived as the most recurrent and risky disorder among young people and adults under the age of 60. Depression has a strong influence on the usage of words which can be observed in the form of written texts or stories posted on social media. With the help of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, the depressive signs expressed by people can be identified at the earliest stage from their Social Media posts. The proposed work aims to introduce an efficacious depression detection model unifying an exemplary feature extraction scheme and a hybrid Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) model. The feature extraction process combines a novel feature selection method called Elite Term Score (ETS) and Word2Vec to extract the syntactic and semantic information respectively. First, the ETS method leverages the document level, class level, and corpus level probabilities for computing the weightage/score of the terms. Then, the ideal and pertinent set of features with a high ETS score is selected, and the Word2vec model is trained to generate the intense feature vector representation for the set of selected terms. Finally, the resultant word vector obtained is called EliteVec, which is fed to the hybrid LSTM model based on Honey Badger optimizer with population reduction technique (PHB) which predicts whether the input textual content is depressive or not. The PHB algorithm is integrated to explore and exploit the optimal hyperparameters for strengthening the performance of the LSTM network.

Mental Health Analysis and Classification During Covid-19 Using Big Data Approach,"Badyal, B.; Digaari, H.; Jain, T.","In December 2019, a deadly virus named SARS-CoV-2 started spreading in the regions of Wuhan, Hubei, China. The number of coronavirus patients gradually increased in Wuhan, and by 20 December, it reached 60 and 266 by 31 December. Till now, there have been more than 40 Lakhs deaths due to Covid-19. This deadly pandemic gave a setback to most people all over the world in terms of losing their loved ones. Apart from that, this pandemic mentally affected a lot of minds. Social illness and loneliness have been linked to poor mental health by a broad body of research, and data from late March suggests a negative increase in mental health. There had been news of people committing suicides or some going under depression all because their social life was cut down and all they did was question their life choices, their existence, their personality, and their achievements which ultimately trapped them in those intrusive thoughts that kept popping up again and again—which made them disturbed or even distressed. The objective of this paper is to analyze and categorize the mental states of people from all over the world in order to raise mental health awareness, particularly during COVID-19. We used the big data approach to display the surge in sadness and suicidal ideation in terms of the increase in the frequency of certain words. To continue with this problem statement, we will examine text data and learn what words are utilized in virtual suicide/depression notes utilizing two subreddits and NLP tools. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",2023,,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,445,,415-426,,10.1007/978-981-19-1412-6_36,,#1296,Badyal 2023,"",""
A Study of BERT-Based Classification Performance of Text-Based Health Counseling Data,"Sung, Y.W.; Park, D.S.; Kim, C.G.","The entry into a hyper-connected society increases the generalization of communication using SNS. Therefore, research to analyze big data accumulated in SNS and extractmeaningful information is being conducted in various fields. In particular, with the recent development of Deep Learning, the performance is rapidly improving by applying it to the field of Natural Language Processing, which is a language understanding technology to obtain accurate contextual information. In this paper, when a chatbot system is applied to the healthcare domain for counseling about diseases, the performance of NLP integrated withmachine learning for the accurate classification ofmedical subjects from text-based health counseling data becomes important. Among the various algorithms, the performance of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers was compared with other algorithms of CNN, RNN, LSTM, and GRU. For this purpose, the health counseling data of Naver Q&A service were crawled as a dataset.

Analysis of E-mental health research: mapping the relationship between information technology and mental healthcare,"Timakum, T.; Xie, Q.; Song, M.","Background: E-mental healthcare is the convergence of digital technologies with mental health services. It has been developed to fill a gap in healthcare for people who need mental wellbeing support that may not otherwise receive psychological treatment. With an increasing number of e-mental healthcare and research, this study aimed to investigate the trends of an e-mental health research field that integrates interdisciplinary fields and to examine the information technologies is being used in mental healthcare. To achieve the research objectives, bibliometric analysis, information extraction, and network analysis were applied to analyze e-mental health research data. Methods: E-mental health research data were obtained from 3663 bibliographic records from the Web of Science (WoS) and 3172 full-text articles from PubMed Central (PMC). The text mining techniques used for this study included bibliometric analysis, information extraction, and visualization. Results: The e-mental health research topic trends primarily involved e-health care services and medical informatics research. The clusters of research comprised 16 clusters, which refer to mental sickness, e-health, diseases, information technology (IT), and self-management. The information extraction analysis revealed a triple relation with IT and biomedical domains. Betweenness centrality was used as a measure of network graph centrality, based on the shortest path to rank the important entities and triple relation; nodes with higher betweenness centrality had greater control over the network because more information passes through that node. The IT entity-relations of “mobile” had the highest score at 0.043466. The top pairs were related to depression, mobile health, and text message. Conclusions: E-mental related publications were associated with various research fields, such as nursing, psychology, medical informatics, computer science, telecommunication, and healthcare innovation. We found that trends in e-mental health research are continually rising. These trends were related to the internet of things (IoT) and mobile applications (Apps), which were applied for mental healthcare services. Moreover, producing AI and machine learning for e-mental healthcare were being studied.

COVID-19 sentiment analysis using college subreddit data,"Yan, T.; Liu, F.","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has affected our society and human well-being in various ways. In this study, we investigate how the pandemic has influenced people's emotions and psychological states compared to a pre-pandemic period using real-world data from social media. Method We collected Reddit social media data from 2019 (pre-pandemic) and 2020 (pandemic) from the subreddits communities associated with eight universities. We applied the pretrained Robustly Optimized BERT pre-training approach (RoBERTa) to learn text embedding from the Reddit messages, and leveraged the relational information among posted messages to train a graph attention network (GAT) for sentiment classification. Finally, we applied model stacking to combine the prediction probabilities from RoBERTa and GAT to yield the final classification on sentiment. With the model-predicted sentiment labels on the collected data, we used a generalized linear mixed-effects model to estimate the effects of pandemic and in-person teaching during the pandemic on sentiment. Results The results suggest that the odds of negative sentiments in 2020 (pandemic) were 25.7% higher than the odds in 2019 (pre-pandemic) with a p-value < 0.001; and the odds of negative sentiments associated in-person learning were 48.3% higher than with remote learning in 2020 with a p-value of 0.029. Conclusions Our study results are consistent with the findings in the literature on the negative impacts of the pandemic on people's emotions and psychological states. Our study contributes to the growing real-world evidence on the various negative impacts of the pandemic on our society; it also provides a good example of using both ML techniques and statistical modeling and inference to make better use of real-world data.  © 2022 Yan, Liu.

Association of Electronic Health Record Inbasket Message Characteristics with Physician Burnout,"Baxter, S.L.; Saseendrakumar, B.R.; Cheung, M.; Savides, T.J.; Longhurst, C.A.; Sinsky, C.A.; Millen, M.; Tai-Seale, M.","Importance: Physician burnout is an ongoing epidemic; electronic health record (EHR) use has been associated with burnout, and the burden of EHR inbasket messages has grown in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding how EHR inbasket messages are associated with physician burnout may uncover new insights for intervention strategies. Objective: To evaluate associations between EHR inbasket message characteristics and physician burnout. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional study in a single academic medical center involving physicians from multiple specialties. Data collection took place April to September 2020, and data were analyzed September to December 2020. Exposures: Physicians responded to a survey including the validated Mini-Z 5-point burnout scale. Main Outcomes and Measures: Physician burnout according to the self-reported burnout scale. A sentiment analysis model was used to calculate sentiment scores for EHR inbasket messages extracted for participating physicians. Multivariable modeling was used to model risk of physician burnout using factors such as message characteristics, physician demographics, and clinical practice characteristics. Results: Of 609 physicians who responded to the survey, 297 (48.8%) were women, 343 (56.3%) were White, 391 (64.2%) practiced in outpatient settings, and 428 (70.28%) had been in medical practice for 15 years or less. Half (307 [50.4%]) reported burnout (score of 3 or higher). A total of 1453245 inbasket messages were extracted, of which 630828 (43.4%) were patient messages. Among negative messages, common words included medical conditions, expletives and/or profanity, and words related to violence. There were no significant associations between message characteristics (including sentiment scores) and burnout. Odds of burnout were significantly higher among Hispanic/Latino physicians (odds ratio [OR], 3.44; 95% CI, 1.18-10.61; P =.03) and women (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.13-2.27; P =.01), and significantly lower among physicians in clinical practice for more than 15 years (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.30-0.68; P <.001). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study, message characteristics were not associated with physician burnout, but the presence of expletives and violent words represents an opportunity for improving patient engagement, EHR portal design, or filters. Natural language processing represents a novel approach to understanding potential associations between EHR inbasket messages and physician burnout and may also help inform quality improvement initiatives aimed at improving patient experience.. © 2022 American Medical Association.

SMAD: SMart assistant during and after a medical emergency case based on deep learning sentiment analysis: The pandemic COVID-19 case,"Ouerhani, N.; Maalel, A.; Ben Ghézala, H.","The huge cost of emergency situations could have fatal effects on humanity and society, and it could present a genuine threat to both of them. In fact, most people confronted with an emergency could feel psychological trauma, which will, for the most part, change over time as they can exhibit chaotic or even turbulent behaviours. The situation could worsen in the case of a pandemic as fear and anxiety invade and spread in addition to isolation and quarantine. In this paper, we propose to build a smart assistant, called SMAD, that could detect the symptoms of an emergency case as well as symptoms of a mental disorder while analysing the natural language speech of an ordinary citizen, during and after an emergency situation using natural language processing and deep learning sentiment analysis model to track the patient’s mental state during an ongoing conversation. Our proposed smart assistant is an online human-bot interaction that could handle a variety of physical and mental circumstances of any emergency situation. The proposed approach is a smart healthcare service that consists of four interconnected modules: The information understanding module, the data collector module, the action generator module, and the mental analysis module, which is based on the sentiment analysis model performed on a social media dataset using a pre-trained word-embedding model. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2022,,Cluster Computing,25,5,3671-3681,,10.1007/s10586-022-03601-7,,#1311,Ouerhani 2022,"",""
Community implications for gun violence prevention during co-occurring pandemics; a qualitative and computational analysis study,"Patton, D.U.; Aguilar, N.; Landau, A.Y.; Thomas, C.; Kagan, R.; Ren, T.; Stoneberg, E.; Wang, T.; Halmos, D.; Saha, A.; Ananthram, A.; McKeown, K.","This study provides insight into New York City residents' perceptions about violence after the outbreak of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) based on information from communities in New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) buildings. In this novel analysis, we used focus group and social media data to confirm or reject findings from qualitative interviews. We first used data from 69 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with low-income residents and community stakeholders to further explore how violence impacts New York City's low-income residents of color, as well as the role of city government in providing tangible support for violence prevention during co-occurring health (COVID-19) and social (anti-Black racism) pandemics. Residents described how COVID-19 and the Black Lives Matter movement impacted safety in their communities while offering direct recommendations to improve safety. Residents also shared recommendations that indirectly improve community safety by addressing long term systemic issues. As the recruitment of interviewees was concluding, researchers facilitated two focus groups with 38 interviewees to discuss similar topics. In order to assess the degree to which the themes discovered in our qualitative interviews were shared by the broader community, we developed an integrative community data science study which leveraged natural language processing and computer vision techniques to study text and images on public social media data of 12 million tweets generated by residents. We joined computational methods with qualitative analysis through a social work lens and design justice principles to most accurately and holistically analyze the community perceptions of gun violence issues and potential prevention strategies. Findings indicate valuable community-based insights that elucidate how the co-occurring pandemics impact residents' experiences of gun violence and provide important implications for gun violence prevention in a digital era. © 2022 The Authors",2022,,Preventive Medicine,165,,,,10.1016/j.ypmed.2022.107263,,#1313,Patton 2022,"",""
Predicting the language of depression from multivariate twitter data using a feature-rich hybrid deep learning model,"Kour, H.; Gupta, M.K.","Depression is a clinical entity that might be difficult for a psychiatrist to diagnose it effectively on time. A depressed person usually suffers from distress and anxiety, leading to serious consequences if not diagnosed early. Social media platforms facilitate users to exchange ideas and dialogs, resulting in the collection of a huge volume of data. Analyzing user's online behavior to categorize depression is a challenging task for researchers. This motivated researchers to investigate machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing techniques supporting research related to depression prediction. The dataset used in the study is a large-scale Twitter dataset. This article aims to investigate a hybrid CNN-LSTM deep learning model with the Word2Vec feature extraction technique for classifying depressive sentiments from Twitter data. By using TF-IDF, PCA, and Word2Vec approaches, this model utilizes significant linguistic features present within the text. The proposed model is evaluated on four benchmark datasets and its efficiency is compared with four traditional machine learning models. Moreover, the proposed model's performance is compared to three deep learning-based hybrid models.

Natural language analyzed with AI-based transformers predict traditional subjective well-being measures approaching the theoretical upper limits in accuracy,"Kjell, O.N.E.; Sikström, S.; Kjell, K.; Schwartz, H.A.","We show that using a recent break-through in artificial intelligence –transformers–, psychological assessments from text-responses can approach theoretical upper limits in accuracy, converging with standard psychological rating scales. Text-responses use people's primary form of communication –natural language– and have been suggested as a more ecologically-valid response format than closed-ended rating scales that dominate social science. However, previous language analysis techniques left a gap between how accurately they converged with standard rating scales and how well ratings scales converge with themselves – a theoretical upper-limit in accuracy. Most recently, AI-based language analysis has gone through a transformation as nearly all of its applications, from Web search to personalized assistants (e.g., Alexa and Siri), have shown unprecedented improvement by using transformers. We evaluate transformers for estimating psychological well-being from questionnaire text- and descriptive word-responses, and find accuracies converging with rating scales that approach the theoretical upper limits (Pearson r = 0.85, p < 0.001, N = 608; in line with most metrics of rating scale reliability).

Mental health-related communication in a virtual community: text mining analysis of a digital exchange platform during the Covid-19 pandemic,"Golz, C.; Richter, D.; Sprecher, N.; Gurtner, C.","Background: Virtual communities played an important role in mental health and well-being during the Covid-19 pandemic by providing access to others and thereby preventing loneliness. The pandemic has accelerated the urge for digital solutions for people with pre-existing mental health problems. So far, it remains unclear how the people concerned communicate with each other and benefit from peer-to-peer support on a moderated digital platform. Objective: The aim of the project was to identify and describe the communication patterns and verbal expression of users on the inCLOUsiv platform during the first lockdown in 2020. Methods: Discussions in forums and live chats on inCLOUsiv were analysed using text mining, which included frequency, correlation, n-gram and sentiment analyses. Results: The communication behaviour of users on inCLOUsiv was benevolent and supportive; and 72% of the identified sentiments were positive. Users addressed the topics of ‘corona’, ‘anxiety’ and ‘crisis’ and shared coping strategies. Conclusions: The benevolent interaction between users on inCLOUsiv is in line with other virtual communities for Covid-19 and the potential for peer-to-peer support. Users can benefit from each other’s experiences and support each other.

In addition to validated bedside tools, the computer-assisted instrument based on clinical notes from electronic medical records may be useful. Aims: To assess the psychometric properties of a Chinese-chart-based keyword instrument for semiautomatically screening delirium using Natural language processing (NLP) based on clinical notes from electronic medical records. Methods: The patients were admitted to West China Hospital from January 2015 to December 2017. Grouping patients based on the medical notes, those with accessible physician documents but no nurse documents were classified as the physician & no-nurse (PNN) group, while those with accessible physician and nurse documents were classified as the physician & nurse (PN) group. The psychometric properties, test–retest reliability, internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's α), and criterion validity were calculated. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the criterion validity of delirium was evaluated in comparison to the results of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. Results: A total of 779 patients were enrolled in the study. Their ages ranged from 65 to 103 years (82.5 ± 6.5), with men accounting for 71.9% of the total. A total of 312 patients had access to only physician documents in the physician & no-nurse (PNN) group, whereas 467 patients had access to both physician and nurse documents in the physician & nurse (PN) group.

Zero-Shot Emotion Detection for Semi-Supervised Sentiment Analysis Using Sentence Transformers and Ensemble Learning,"Tesfagergish, S.G.; Kapočiūtė-Dzikienė, J.; Damaševičius, R.","We live in a digitized era where our daily life depends on using online resources. Businesses consider the opinions of their customers, while people rely on the reviews/comments of other users before buying specific products or services. These reviews/comments are usually provided in the non-normative natural language within different contexts and domains (in social media, forums, news, blogs, etc.). Sentiment classification plays an important role in analyzing such texts collected from users by assigning positive, negative, and sometimes neutral sentiment values to each of them. Moreover, these texts typically contain many expressed or hidden emotions (such as happiness, sadness, etc.) that could contribute significantly to identifying sentiments. We address the emotion detection problem as part of the sentiment analysis task and propose a two-stage emotion detection methodology. The first stage is the unsupervised zero-shot learning model based on a sentence transformer returning the probabilities for subsets of 34 emotions (anger, sadness, disgust, fear, joy, happiness, admiration, affection, anguish, caution, confusion, desire, disappointment, attraction, envy, excitement, grief, hope, horror, joy, love, loneliness, pleasure, fear, generosity, rage, relief, satisfaction, sorrow, wonder, sympathy, shame, terror, and panic). The output of the zero-shot model is used as an input for the second stage, which trains the machine learning classifier on the sentiment labels in a supervised manner using ensemble learning.

A Novel Technique to Identify Intimate Partner Violence in a Hospital Setting,"Tabaie, A.; Zeidan, A.J.; Evans, D.P.; Smith, R.N.; Kamaleswaran, R.","Introduction: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is defined as sexual, physical, psychological, or economic violence that occurs between current or former intimate partners. Victims of IPV may seek care for violence-related injuries in healthcare settings, which makes recognition and intervention in these facilities critical. In this study our goal was to develop an algorithm using natural language processing (NLP) to identify cases of IPV within emergency department (ED) settings. Methods: In this observational cohort study, we extracted unstructured physician and advanced practice provider, nursing, and social worker notes from hospital electronic health records (EHR). The recorded clinical notes and patient narratives were screened for a set of 23 situational terms, derived from the literature on IPV (ie, assault by spouse), along with an additional set of 49 extended situational terms, extracted from known IPV cases (ie, attack by spouse). We compared the effectiveness of the proposed model with detection of IPV-related International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, codes. Results: We included in the analysis a total of 1,064,735 patient encounters (405,303 patients who visited the ED of a Level I trauma center) from January 2012–August 2020. The outcome was identification of an IPV-related encounter. In this study we used information embedded in unstructured EHR data to develop a NLP algorithm that employs clinical notes to identify IPV visits to the ED. Using a set of 23 situational terms along with 49 extended situational terms, the algorithm successfully identified 7,399 IPV-related encounters representing 5,975 patients; the algorithm achieved 99.5% precision in detecting positive cases in our sample of 1,064,735 ED encounters. Conclusion: Using a set of pre-defined IPV-related terms, we successfully developed a novel natural language processing algorithm capable of identifying intimate partner violence.

An Assessment of Mentions of Adverse Drug Events on Social Media with Natural Language Processing: Model Development and Analysis,"Yu, D.; Vydiswaran, V.G.V.","Background: Adverse reactions to drugs attract significant concern in both clinical practice and public health monitoring. Multiple measures have been put into place to increase postmarketing surveillance of the adverse effects of drugs and to improve drug safety. These measures include implementing spontaneous reporting systems and developing automated natural language processing systems based on data from electronic health records and social media to collect evidence of adverse drug events that can be further investigated as possible adverse reactions. Objective: While using social media for collecting evidence of adverse drug events has potential, it is not clear whether social media are a reliable source for this information. Our work aims to (1) develop natural language processing approaches to identify adverse drug events on social media and (2) assess the reliability of social media data to identify adverse drug events. Methods: We propose a collocated long short-term memory network model with attentive pooling and aggregated, contextual representation generated by a pretrained model. We applied this model on large-scale Twitter data to identify adverse drug event–related tweets. We conducted a qualitative content analysis of these tweets to validate the reliability of social media data as a means to collect such information. Results: The model outperformed a variant without contextual representation during both the validation and evaluation phases. Through the content analysis of adverse drug event tweets, we observed that adverse drug event–related discussions had 7 themes. Mental health–related, sleep-related, and pain-related adverse drug event discussions were most frequent. We also contrast known adverse drug reactions to those mentioned in tweets. Conclusions: We observed a distinct improvement in the model when it used contextual information. However, our results reveal weak generalizability of the current systems to unseen data. Additional research is needed to fully utilize social media data and improve the robustness and reliability of natural language processing systems. The content analysis, on the other hand, showed that Twitter covered a sufficiently wide range of adverse drug events, as well as known adverse reactions, for the drugs mentioned in tweets. Our work demonstrates that social media can be a reliable data source for collecting adverse drug event mentions. ©Deahan Yu, V G Vinod Vydiswaran.",2022,,JMIR Medical Informatics,10,9,,,10.2196/38140,,#1337,Yu 2022,"",""
Estimating the Prevalence of Intimate Partner Violence at an Urban Hospital Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic Using a Novel Natural Language Processing Algorithm,"Zeidan, A.; Evans, D.P.; Smith, R.N.; Tabaie, A.; Kamaleswaran, R.","The impact of COVID-19 on intimate partner violence (IPV) in the United States is still relatively unknown, although some early data demonstrate that cases of IPV increased during COVID-19. The objective of this study was to measure the prevalence of IPV before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in a southeastern urban hospital. We performed a retrospective analysis of IPV encounters at a single high-volume Level I trauma hospital. IPV encounters were identified through a novel natural language processing algorithm using IPV-related words and phrases within unstructured clinical notes. IPV encounters from February to August 2019 (pre-COVID-19 period) were compared with encounters from February to August 2020 (COVID-19 period). The IPV visit rate during the COVID-19 period was higher than that during the pre-COVID-19 period (0.82% of all visits in 2020 vs. 0.72% of all visits in 2019). The number of IPV encounters for patients with no prior IPV visits was higher in 2020, whereas the number of revisits, patients with prior IPV encounters, was lower in 2020. There was an increased incidence of IPV during the COVID-19 pandemic with an increase in the number of patients presenting with first time IPV encounters. Future hospital and community pandemic preparedness protocols must include expansion of screening, resource allocation, and protective policies for those in unsafe situations.

Stress detection using natural language processing and machine learning over social interactions,"Nijhawan, T.; Attigeri, G.; Ananthakrishna, T.","Cyberspace is a vast soapbox for people to post anything that they witness in their day-to-day lives. Social media content is mostly used for review, opinion, influence, or sentiment analysis. In this paper, we aim to extend sentiment and emotion analysis for detecting the stress of an individual based on the posts and comments shared by him/her on social networking platforms. We leverage large-scale datasets with tweets to accomplish sentiment analysis with the aid of machine learning algorithms and a deep learning model, BERT for sentiment classification. We also adopted Latent Dirichlet Allocation which is an unsupervised machine learning method for scanning a group of documents, recognizing the word and phrase patterns within them, and gathering word groups and alike expressions that most precisely illustrate a set of documents. This helps us to predict which topic is linked to the textual data. With the aid of these models, we will be able to detect the emotion of users online. Further, these emotions can be used to analyze stress or depression. In conclusion, the ML models and a BERT model have a very good detection rate. This research is useful for the well-being of one's mental health. The results are evaluated using various metrics at the macro and micro levels and indicate that the trained model detects the status of emotions based on social interactions. © 2022, The Author(s).",2022,,Journal of Big Data,9,1,,,10.1186/s40537-022-00575-6,,#1340,Nijhawan 2022,"",""
Improving the Applicability of AI for Psychiatric Applications through Human-in-the-loop Methodologies,"Chandler, C.; Foltz, P.W.; Elvevåg, B.","Objectives: Machine learning (ML) and natural language processing have great potential to improve efficiency and accuracy in diagnosis, treatment recommendations, predictive interventions, and scarce resource allocation within psychiatry. Researchers often conceptualize such an approach as operating in isolation without much need for human involvement, yet it remains crucial to harness human-in-the-loop practices when developing and implementing such techniques as their absence may be catastrophic. We advocate for building ML-based technologies that collaborate with experts within psychiatry in all stages of implementation and use to increase model performance while simultaneously increasing the practicality, robustness, and reliability of the process. Methods: We showcase pitfalls of the traditional ML framework and explain how it can be improved with human-in-the-loop techniques. Specifically, we applied active learning strategies to the automatic scoring of a story recall task and compared the results to a traditional approach. Results: Human-in-the-loop methodologies supplied a greater understanding of where the model was least confident or had knowledge gaps during training. As compared to the traditional framework, less than half of the training data were needed to reach a given accuracy. Conclusions: Human-in-the-loop ML is an approach to data collection and model creation that harnesses active learning to select the most critical data needed to increase a model’s accuracy and generalizability more efficiently than classic random sampling would otherwise allow. Such techniques may additionally operate as safeguards from spurious predictions and can aid in decreasing disparities that artificial intelligence systems otherwise propagate. © The Author(s) 2022.

Depression Detection Based on Hybrid Deep Learning SSCL Framework Using Self-Attention Mechanism: An Application to Social Networking Data,"Nadeem, A.; Naveed, M.; Islam Satti, M.; Afzal, H.; Ahmad, T.; Kim, K.-I.","In today’s world, mental health diseases have become highly prevalent, and depression is one of the mental health problems that has become widespread. According to WHO reports, depression is the second-leading cause of the global burden of diseases. In the proliferation of such issues, social media has proven to be a great platform for people to express themselves. Thus, a user’s social media can speak a great deal about his/her emotional state and mental health. Considering the high pervasiveness of the disease, this paper presents a novel framework for depression detection from textual data, employing Natural Language Processing and deep learning techniques. For this purpose, a dataset consisting of tweets was created, which were then manually annotated by the domain experts to capture the implicit and explicit depression context. Two variations of the dataset were created, on having binary and one ternary labels, respectively. Ultimately, a deep-learning-based hybrid Sequence, Semantic, Context Learning (SSCL) classification framework with a self-attention mechanism is proposed that utilizes GloVe (pre-trained word embeddings) for feature extraction; LSTM and CNN were used to capture the sequence and semantics of tweets; finally, the GRUs and self-attention mechanism were used, which focus on contextual and implicit information in the tweets. The framework outperformed the existing techniques in detecting the explicit and implicit context, with an accuracy of 97.4 for binary labeled data and 82.9 for ternary labeled data. We further tested our proposed SSCL framework on unseen data (random tweets), for which an F1-score of 94.4 was achieved. Furthermore, in order to showcase the strengths of the proposed framework, we validated it on the “News Headline Data set” for sarcasm detection, considering a dataset from a different domain. It also outmatched the performance of existing techniques in cross-domain validation. © 2022 by the authors.",2022,,Sensors,22,24,,,10.3390/s22249775,,#1343,Nadeem 2022,"",""

Association between depressive symptoms and diagnosis of diabetes and its complications: A network analysis in electronic health records,"Wan, C.; Feng, W.; Ma, R.; Ma, H.; Wang, J.; Huang, R.; Zhang, X.; Jing, M.; Yang, H.; Yu, H.; Liu, Y.","Objectives: Diabetes and its complications are commonly associated with depressive symptoms, and few studies have investigated the diagnosis effect of depressive symptoms in patients with diabetes. The present study used a network-based approach to explore the association between depressive symptoms, which are annotated from electronic health record (EHR) notes by a deep learning model, and the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its complications. Methods: In this study, we used anonymous admission notes of 52,139 inpatients diagnosed with T2DM at the first affiliated hospital of Nanjing Medical University from 2008 to 2016 as input for a symptom annotation model named T5-depression based on transformer architecture which helps to annotate depressive symptoms from present illness. We measured the performance of the model by using the F1 score and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). We constructed networks of depressive symptoms to examine the connectivity of these networks in patients diagnosed with T2DM, including those with certain complications. Results: The T5-depression model achieved the best performance with an F1-score of 91.71 and an AUROC of 96.25 compared with the benchmark models. The connectivity of depressive symptoms in patients diagnosed with T2DM (p = 0.025) and hypertension (p = 0.013) showed a statistically significant increase 2 years after the diagnosis, which is consistent with the number of patients diagnosed with depression. Conclusion: The T5-depression model proposed in this study can effectively annotate depressive symptoms in EHR notes. The connectivity of annotated depressive symptoms is associated with the diagnosis of T2DM and hypertension. The changes in the network of depressive symptoms generated by the T5-depression model could be used as an indicator for screening depression.

Interdisciplinary IoT and Emotion Knowledge Graph-Based Recommendation System to Boost Mental Health,"Gyrard, A.; Boudaoud, K.","Humans are feeling emotions every day, but they can still encounter difficulties understanding them. To better understand emotions, we integrated interdisciplinary knowledge about emotions from various domains such as neurosciences (e.g., neurobiology), physiology, and psychology (affective sciences, positive psychology, cognitive psychology, psychophysiology, neuropsychology, etc.). To organize the knowledge, we employ technologies such as Artificial Intelligence with Knowledge Graphs and Semantic Reasoning. Furthermore, Internet of Things (IoT) technologies can help to acquire physiological data knowledge. The goal of this paper is to aggregate the interdisciplinary knowledge and implement it within the Emotional Knowledge Graph (EmoKG). The Emotional Knowledge Graph is used within our naturopathy recommender system that suggests food to boost emotion (e.g., chocolate contains magnesium that is recommended when we feel depressed). The recommender system also answers a set of competency questions to easily retrieve emotional related-knowledge from EmoKG, such as what are the basic emotions and the more sophisticated ones, what are the neurotransmitters and hormones related to emotions, etc. To follow FAIR principles, EmoKG is mapped to existing knowledge bases found on the BioPortal biomedical ontology catalog such as SNOMEDCT, FMA, RXNORM, MedDRA, and also from emotion ontologies (when available online). We design the LOV4IoT-Emotion ontology catalog that encourages researchers from heterogeneous communities to apply FAIR principles by releasing online their (emotion) ontologies, datasets, rules, etc. The set of ontology codes shared online can be semi-automatically processed; if not available, the scientific publications describing the emotion ontologies are semi-automatically processed with Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies. This research is also relevant for other use cases such as European projects (ACCRA for emotional robots to reduce the social isolation of aging people, StandICT for standardization, and AI4EU for Artificial Intelligence) and alliances for IoT such as AIOTI.

Text mining to improve screening for trauma-related symptoms in a global sample,"Marengo, D.; Hoeboer, C.M.; Veldkamp, B.P.; Olff, M.","Previous studies showed that textual information could be used to screen respondents for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In this study, we explored the feasibility of using language features extracted from short text descriptions respondents provided of stressful events to predict trauma-related symptoms assessed using the Global Psychotrauma Screen. Texts were analyzed with both closed- and open-vocabulary methods to extract language features representing the occurrence of words, phrases, or specific topics in the description of stressful events. We also evaluated whether combining language features with self-report information, including respondents’ demographics, event characteristics, and risk factors for trauma-related disorders, would improve the prediction performance. Data were collected using an online survey on a cross-national sample of 5048 respondents. Results showed that language data achieved the highest predictive power when both closed- and open-vocabulary features were included as predictors. Combining language data and self-report information resulted in a significant increase in performance and in a model which achieved good accuracy as a screener for probable PTSD diagnosis (.7 < AUC ≤ .8), with similar results regardless of the length of the text description of the event. Overall, results indicated that short texts add to the detection of trauma-related symptoms and probable PTSD diagnosis. © 2022 The Author(s)",2022,,Psychiatry Research,316,,,,10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114753,,#1352,Marengo 2022,"",""
"Understanding psychiatric illness through natural language processing (UNDERPIN): Rationale, design, and methodology","Kishimoto, T.; Nakamura, H.; Kano, Y.; Eguchi, Y.; Kitazawa, M.; Liang, K.-C.; Kudo, K.; Sento, A.; Takamiya, A.; Horigome, T.; Yamasaki, T.; Sunami, Y.; Kikuchi, T.; Nakajima, K.; Tomita, M.; Bun, S.; Momota, Y.; Sawada, K.; Murakami, J.; Takahashi, H.; Mimura, M.","Introduction: Psychiatric disorders are diagnosed through observations of psychiatrists according to diagnostic criteria such as the DSM-5. Such observations, however, are mainly based on each psychiatrist's level of experience and often lack objectivity, potentially leading to disagreements among psychiatrists. In contrast, specific linguistic features can be observed in some psychiatric disorders, such as a loosening of associations in schizophrenia. Some studies explored biomarkers, but biomarkers have yet to be used in clinical practice. Aim: The purposes of this study are to create a large dataset of Japanese speech data labeled with detailed information on psychiatric disorders and neurocognitive disorders to quantify the linguistic features of those disorders using natural language processing and, finally, to develop objective and easy-to-use biomarkers for diagnosing and assessing the severity of them. Methods: This study will have a multi-center prospective design. The DSM-5 or ICD-11 criteria for major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and anxiety disorder and for major and minor neurocognitive disorders will be regarded as the inclusion criteria for the psychiatric disorder samples. For the healthy subjects, the absence of a history of psychiatric disorders will be confirmed using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.). The absence of current cognitive decline will be confirmed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). A psychiatrist or psychologist will conduct 30-to-60-min interviews with each participant; these interviews will include free conversation, picture-description task, and story-telling task, all of which will be recorded using a microphone headset. In addition, the severity of disorders will be assessed using clinical rating scales. Data will be collected from each participant at least twice during the study period and up to a maximum of five times at an interval of at least one month. Discussion: This study is unique in its large sample size and the novelty of its method, and has potential for applications in many fields. We have some challenges regarding inter-rater reliability and the linguistic peculiarities of Japanese. As of September 2022, we have collected a total of >1000 records from >400 participants.

Text Topics and Treatment Response in Internet-Delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Generalized Anxiety Disorder: Text Mining Study,"Mylläri, S.; Saarni, S.E.; Ritola, V.; Joffe, G.; Stenberg, J.-H.; Solbakken, O.A.; Czajkowski, N.O.; Rosenström, T.","Background: Text mining methods such as topic modeling can offer valuable information on how and to whom internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapies (iCBT) work. Although iCBT treatments provide convenient data for topic modeling, it has rarely been used in this context. Objective: Our aims were to apply topic modeling to written assignment texts from iCBT for generalized anxiety disorder and explore the resulting topics' associations with treatment response. As predetermining the number of topics presents a considerable challenge in topic modeling, we also aimed to explore a novel method for topic number selection. Methods: We defined 2 latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic models using a novel data-driven and a more commonly used interpretability-based topic number selection approaches. We used multilevel models to associate the topics with continuous-valued treatment response, defined as the rate of per-session change in GAD-7 sum scores throughout the treatment. Results: Our analyses included 1686 patients. We observed 2 topics that were associated with better than average treatment response: ""well-being of family, pets, and loved ones""from the data-driven LDA model (B=-0.10 SD/session/Δtopic; 95% CI -016 to -0.03) and ""children, family issues""from the interpretability-based model (B=-0.18 SD/session/Δtopic; 95% CI -0.31 to -0.05). Two topics were associated with worse treatment response: ""monitoring of thoughts and worries""from the data-driven model (B=0.06 SD/session/Δtopic; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.11) and ""internet therapy""from the interpretability-based model (B=0.27 SD/session/Δtopic; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.46). Conclusions: The 2 LDA models were different in terms of their interpretability and broadness of topics but both contained topics that were associated with treatment response in an interpretable manner.

The current study aimed to better characterize job-related problems prior to physician suicide. Methods: The study utilized a mixed methods approach combining thematic analysis and natural language processing to develop themes representing death investigation narratives of 200 physician suicides with implicated job problems in the National Violent Death Reporting System database between 2003 and 2018. Results: Through thematic analysis, six overarching themes were identified: incapacity to work due to deterioration of physical health, substance use jeopardizing employment, interaction between mental health and work-related issues, relationship conflict affecting work, legal problems leading to work-related stress, and increased financial stress. Natural language processing analysis confirmed five of these themes and elucidated important subthemes. Conclusions: This is the first known study that integrated thematic analysis and natural language processing to characterize work-related stressors preceding physician suicide.

Deep-EmoRU: mining emotions from roman urdu text using deep learning ensemble,"Majeed, A.; Beg, M.O.; Arshad, U.; Mujtaba, H.","Detecting emotions play a vital role in our lives. In various ways, people convey their feelings, i.e., facial expressions, movements, speech, and text. This study aims to classify the emotions from Roman Urdu’s text. Much research has previously been done on different emotion detection languages, but there is minimal work done in Roman Urdu. There is also a need to explore Roman Urdu, as it is the most widely used social media site for communication. The absence of a benchmark corpus for emotion detection from text is a significant problem for Roman Urdu because language assets are essential for various tasks of natural language processing (NLP). The emotional analysis has many practical applications, such as optimizing product quality, dialog systems, investment patterns, and mental health. In this research, we build a corpus of 18k sentences collected from different domains and annotate it with six other classes to concentrate on the emotional polarity of the Roman Urdu text. We also proposed a Deep-EmoRU model for emotion detection from Roman Urdu text. Our proposed model is based on Long short-term memory (LSTM) and Convolutional neural network (CNN) feature learners.

Methods: All MDD radiology studies publications from January 2002 to January 2022 were downloaded from PubMed using R, a statistical computing language. R and the interpretive general-purpose programming language Python were used to extract publication dates, geographic information, and abstracts from each publication’s metadata for bibliometric analysis. The generative statistical algorithm “Latent Dirichlet allocation” (LDA) was applied to identify specific research focus and trends. The unsupervised Leuven algorithm was used to build a network to identify relationships between research focus. Results: A total of 5,566 publications on MDD and radiology research were identified, and there is a rapid upward trend. The top-cited publications were 11,042, and the highly-cited publications focused on improving diagnostic performance and establishing imaging standards. Publications came from 76 countries, with the most from research institutions in the United States and China. Hospitals and radiology departments take the lead in research and have an advantage. The extensive field of study contains 12,058 Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms.

Mental Illness Concordance Between Hospital Clinical Records and Mentions in Domestic Violence Police Narratives: Data Linkage Study,"Karystianis, G.; Cabral, R.C.; Adily, A.; Lukmanjaya, W.; Schofield, P.; Buchan, I.; Nenadic, G.; Butler, T.","Background: To better understand domestic violence, data sources from multiple sectors such as police, justice, health, and welfare are needed. Linking police data to data collections from other agencies could provide unique insights and promote an all-of-government response to domestic violence. The New South Wales Police Force attends domestic violence events and records information in the form of both structured data and a free-text narrative, with the latter shown to be a rich source of information on the mental health status of persons of interest (POIs) and victims, abuse types, and sustained injuries. Objective: This study aims to examine the concordance (ie, matching) between mental illness mentions extracted from the police’s event narratives and mental health diagnoses from hospital and emergency department records. Methods: We applied a rule-based text mining method on 416,441 domestic violence police event narratives between December 2005 and January 2016 to identify mental illness mentions for POIs and victims. Using different window periods (1, 3, 6, and 12 months) before and after a domestic violence event, we linked the extracted mental illness mentions of victims and POIs to clinical records from the Emergency Department Data Collection and the Admitted Patient Data Collection in New South Wales, Australia using a unique identifier for each individual in the same cohort. Results: Using a 2-year window period (ie, 12 months before and after the domestic violence event), less than 1% (3020/416,441, 0.73%) of events had a mental illness mention and also a corresponding hospital record. About 16% of domestic violence events for both POIs (382/2395, 15.95%) and victims (101/631, 16.01%) had an agreement between hospital records and police narrative mentions of mental illness. A total of 51,025/416,441 (12.25%) events for POIs and 14,802/416,441 (3.55%) events for victims had mental illness mentions in their narratives but no hospital record. Only 841 events for POIs and 919 events for victims had a documented hospital record within 48 hours of the domestic violence event. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that current surveillance systems used to report on domestic violence may be enhanced by accessing rich information (ie, mental illness) contained in police text narratives, made available for both POIs and victims through the application of text mining.

What can we learn about the psychiatric diagnostic categories by analysing patients' lived experiences with Machine-Learning?,"Ghosh, C.C.; McVicar, D.; Davidson, G.; Shannon, C.; Armour, C.","Background: To deliver appropriate mental healthcare interventions and support, it is imperative to be able to distinguish one person from the other. The current classification of mental illness (e.g., DSM) is unable to do that well, indicating the problem of diagnostic heterogeneity between disorders (i.e., the disorder categories have many common symptoms). As a result, the same person might be diagnosed with two different disorders by two independent clinicians. We argue that this problem might have resulted because these disorders were created by a group of humans (APA taskforce members) who relied on more intuition and consensus than data. Literature suggests that human-led decisions are prone to biases, group-thinking, and other factors (such as financial conflict of interest) that can enormously influence creating diagnostic and treatment guidelines. Therefore, in this study, we inquire that if we prevent such human intervention (and thereby their associated biases) and use Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) to form those disorder structures from the data (patient-reported symptoms) directly, then can we come up with homogenous clusters or categories (representing disorders/syndromes: a group of co-occurring symptoms) that are adequately distinguishable from each other for them to be clinically useful. Additionally, we inquired how these A.I.-created categories differ (or are similar) from human-created categories. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study, that demonstrated how to use narrative qualitative data from patients with psychopathology and group their experiences using an A.I. Therefore, the current study also attempts to serve as a proof-of-concept. Method: We used secondary data scraped from online communities and consisting of 10,933 patients’ narratives about their lived experiences. These patients were diagnosed with one or more DSM diagnoses for mental illness. Using Natural Language Processing techniques, we converted the text data into a numeric form. We then used an Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm called K-Means Clustering to group/cluster the symptoms. Results: Using the data mining approach, the A.I. found four categories/clusters formed from the data. We presented ten symptoms or experiences under each cluster to demonstrate the practicality of application and understanding. We also identified the transdiagnostic factors and symptoms that were unique to each of these four clusters. We explored the extent of similarities between these clusters and studied the difference in data density in them. Finally, we reported the silhouette score of + 0.046, indicating that the clusters are poorly distinguishable from each other (i.e., they have high overlapping symptoms). Discussion: We infer that whether humans attempt to categorise mental illnesses or an A.I., the result is that the categories of mental disorders will not be unique enough to be able to distinguish one service seeker from another. Therefore, the categorical approach of diagnosing mental disorders can be argued to fall short of its purpose. We need to search for a classification system beyond the categorical approaches even if there are secondary merits (such as ease of communication and black-and-white (binary) decision making). However, using our A.I. based data mining approach had several meritorious findings. For example, we found that some symptoms are more exclusive or unique to one cluster. In contrast, others are shared by most other clusters (i.e., identification of transdiagnostic experiences). Such differences are interesting objects of inquiry for future studies. For example, in clear contrast to the traditional diagnostic systems, while some experiences, such as auditory hallucinations, are present in all four clusters, others, such as trouble with eating, are exclusive to one cluster (representing a syndrome: a group of co-occurring symptoms). We argue that trans-diagnostic conditions (e.g., auditory hallucinations) might be prime targets for symptom-level interventions. For syndrome-level grouping and intervention, however, we argue that exclusive symptoms are the main targets. Conclusion: Categorical approach to mental disorders is not a way forward because the categories are not unique enough and have several shared symptoms. We argue that the same symptoms can be present in more than one syndrome, although dimensionally different. However, we need additional studies to test this hypothesis. Future directions and implications were discussed. © 2022, The Author(s).",2022,,BMC Psychiatry,22,1,,,10.1186/s12888-022-03984-2,,#1367,Ghosh 2022,"",""
Signals of increasing co-use of stimulants and opioids from online drug forum data,"Sarker, A.; Al-Garadi, M.A.; Ge, Y.; Nataraj, N.; Jones, C.M.; Sumner, S.A.","Background: Despite recent rises in fatal overdoses involving multiple substances, there is a paucity of knowledge about stimulant co-use patterns among people who use opioids (PWUO) or people being treated with medications for opioid use disorder (PTMOUD). A better understanding of the timing and patterns in stimulant co-use among PWUO based on mentions of these substances on social media can help inform prevention programs, policy, and future research directions. This study examines stimulant co-mention trends among PWUO/PTMOUD on social media over multiple years. Methods: We collected publicly available data from 14 forums on Reddit (subreddits) that focused on prescription and illicit opioids, and medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Collected data ranged from 2011 to 2020, and we also collected timelines comprising past posts from a sample of Reddit users (Redditors) on these forums. We applied natural language processing to generate lexical variants of all included prescription and illicit opioids and stimulants and detect mentions of them on the chosen subreddits. Finally, we analyzed and described trends and patterns in co-mentions. Results: Posts collected for 13,812 Redditors showed that 12,306 (89.1%) mentioned at least 1 opioid, opioid-related medication, or stimulant. Analyses revealed that the number and proportion of Redditors mentioning both opioids and/or opioid-related medications and stimulants steadily increased over time. Relative rates of co-mentions by the same Redditor of heroin and methamphetamine, the substances most commonly co-mentioned, decreased in recent years, while co-mentions of both fentanyl and MOUD with methamphetamine increased. Conclusion: Our analyses reflect increasing mentions of stimulants, particularly methamphetamine, among PWUO/PTMOUD, which closely resembles the growth in overdose deaths involving both opioids and stimulants. These findings are consistent with recent reports suggesting increasing stimulant use among people receiving treatment for opioid use disorder. These data offer insights on emerging trends in the overdose epidemic and underscore the importance of scaling efforts to address co-occurring opioid and stimulant use including harm reduction and comprehensive healthcare access spanning mental-health services and substance use disorder treatment. © 2022, The Author(s).",2022,,Harm Reduction Journal,19,1,,,10.1186/s12954-022-00628-2,,#1371,Sarker 2022,"",""
Thinking Aloud or Screaming Inside: Exploratory Study of Sentiment Around Work,"Tania, M.H.; Hossain, M.R.; Jahanara, N.; Andreev, I.; Clifton, D.A.","Background: Millions of workers experience work-related ill health every year. The loss of working days often accounts for poor well-being because of discomfort and stress caused by the workplace. The ongoing pandemic and postpandemic shift in socioeconomic and work culture can continue to contribute to adverse work-related sentiments. Critically investigating state-of-the-art technologies, this study identifies the research gaps in recognizing workers’ need for well-being support, and we aspire to understand how such evidence can be collected to transform the workforce and workplace. Objective: Building on recent advances in sentiment analysis, this study aims to closely examine the potential of social media as a tool to assess workers’ emotions toward the workplace. Methods: This study collected a large Twitter data set comprising both pandemic and prepandemic tweets facilitated through a human-in-the-loop approach in combination with unsupervised learning and meta-heuristic optimization algorithms. The raw data preprocessed through natural language processing techniques were assessed using a generative statistical model and a lexicon-assisted rule-based model, mapping lexical features to emotion intensities. This study also assigned human annotations and performed work-related sentiment analysis. Results: A mixed methods approach, including topic modeling using latent Dirichlet allocation, identified the top topics from the corpus to understand how Twitter users engage with discussions on work-related sentiments. The sorted aspects were portrayed through overlapped clusters and low intertopic distances. However, further analysis comprising the Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoner suggested a smaller number of negative polarities among diverse subjects. By contrast, the human-annotated data set created for this study contained more negative sentiments. In this study, sentimental juxtaposition revealed through the labeled data set was supported by the n-gram analysis as well. Conclusions: The developed data set demonstrates that work-related sentiments are projected onto social media, which offers an opportunity to better support workers. The infrastructure of the workplace, the nature of the work, the culture within the industry and the particular organization, employers, colleagues, person-specific habits, and upbringing all play a part in the health and well-being of any working adult who contributes to the productivity of the organization. Therefore, understanding the origin and influence of the complex underlying factors both qualitatively and quantitatively can inform the next generation of workplaces to drive positive change by relying on empirically grounded evidence. Therefore, this study outlines a comprehensive approach to capture deeper insights into work-related health. ©Marzia Hoque Tania, Md Razon Hossain, Nuzhat Jahanara, Ilya Andreev, David A Clifton.",2022,,JMIR Formative Research,6,9,,,10.2196/30113,,#1372,Tania 2022,"",""
Perceived barriers to psychiatric help-seeking in South Korea by age groups: text mining analyses of social media big data,"Seo, H.Y.; Song, G.Y.; Ku, J.W.; Park, H.Y.; Myung, W.; Kim, H.J.; Baek, C.H.; Lee, N.; Sohn, J.H.; Yoo, H.J.; Park, J.E.","Background: The psychiatric treatment gap is substantial in Korea, implying barriers in seeking help. Objectives: This study aims to explore barriers of seeing psychiatrists, expressed on the internet by age groups. Methods: A corpus of data was garnered extensively from internet communities, blogs and social network services from 1 January 2016 to 31 July 2019. Among the texts collected, texts containing words linked to psychiatry were selected. Then the corpus was dismantled into words by using natural language processing. Words linked to barriers to seeking help were identified and classified. Then the words from web communities that we were able to identify the age groups were additionally organized by age groups. Results: 97,730,360 articles were identified and 6,097,369 were included in the analysis. Words implying the barriers were selected and classified into four groups of structural discrimination, public prejudice, low accessibility, and adverse drug effects. Structural discrimination was the greatest barrier occupying 34%, followed by public prejudice (27.8%), adverse drug effects (18.6%), and cost/low accessibility (16.1%). In the analysis by age groups, structural discrimination caused teenagers (51%), job seekers (64%) and mothers with children (43%) the most concern. In contrast, the public prejudice (49%) was the greatest barriers in the senior group. Conclusions: Although structural discrimination may most contribute to barriers to visiting psychiatrists in Korea, variation by generations may exist. Along with the general attempt to tackle the discrimination, customized approach might be needed. © 2022, The Author(s).",2022,,BMC Psychiatry,22,1,,,10.1186/s12888-022-03969-1,,#1373,Seo 2022,"",""
"Facilitators and barriers to compliance with COVID-19 guidelines: a structural topic modelling analysis of free-text data from 17,500 UK adults","Wright, L.; Paul, E.; Steptoe, A.; Fancourt, D.","Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK government implemented a series of guidelines, rules, and restrictions to change citizens’ behaviour to tackle the spread of the virus, such as the promotion of face masks and the imposition of lockdown stay-at-home orders. The success of such measures requires active co-operation on the part of citizens, but compliance was not complete. Detailed research is required on the factors that aided or hindered compliance with these measures. Methods: To understand the facilitators and barriers to compliance with COVID-19 guidelines, we used structural topic modelling, a text mining technique, to extract themes from over 26,000 free-text survey responses from 17,500 UK adults, collected between 17 November and 23 December 2020. Results: The main factors facilitating compliance were desires to reduce risk to oneself and one’s family and friends and to, a lesser extent, the general public. Also of importance were a desire to return to normality, the availability of activities and technological means to contact family and friends, and the ability to work from home. Identified barriers were difficulties maintaining social distancing in public (due to the actions of other people or environmental constraints), the need to provide or receive support from family and friends, social isolation, missing loved ones, and mental health impacts, perceiving the risks as low, social pressure to not comply, and difficulties understanding and keep abreast of changing rules. Several of the barriers and facilitators raised were related to participant characteristics. Notably, women were more likely to discuss needing to provide or receive mental health support from friends and family. Conclusion: The results demonstrated an array of factors contributed to compliance with guidelines. Of particular policy importance, the results suggest that government communication that emphasizes the potential risks of the virus and provides simple, consistent guidance on how to reduce the spread of the virus would improve compliance with preventive behaviours as COVID-19 continues and for future pandemics. © 2021, The Author(s).",2022,,BMC Public Health,22,1,,,10.1186/s12889-021-12372-6,,#1374,Wright 2022,"",""
Information extraction from free text for aiding transdiagnostic psychiatry: constructing NLP pipelines tailored to clinicians’ needs,"Turner, R.J.; Coenen, F.; Roelofs, F.; Hagoort, K.; Härmä, A.; Grünwald, P.D.; Velders, F.P.; Scheepers, F.E.","Background: Developing predictive models for precision psychiatry is challenging because of unavailability of the necessary data: extracting useful information from existing electronic health record (EHR) data is not straightforward, and available clinical trial datasets are often not representative for heterogeneous patient groups. The aim of this study was constructing a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline that extracts variables for building predictive models from EHRs. We specifically tailor the pipeline for extracting information on outcomes of psychiatry treatment trajectories, applicable throughout the entire spectrum of mental health disorders (“transdiagnostic”). Methods: A qualitative study into beliefs of clinical staff on measuring treatment outcomes was conducted to construct a candidate list of variables to extract from the EHR. To investigate if the proposed variables are suitable for measuring treatment effects, resulting themes were compared to transdiagnostic outcome measures currently used in psychiatry research and compared to the HDRS (as a gold standard) through systematic review, resulting in an ideal set of variables. To extract these from EHR data, a semi-rule based NLP pipeline was constructed and tailored to the candidate variables using Prodigy. Classification accuracy and F1-scores were calculated and pipeline output was compared to HDRS scores using clinical notes from patients admitted in 2019 and 2020. Results: Analysis of 34 questionnaires answered by clinical staff resulted in four themes defining treatment outcomes: symptom reduction, general well-being, social functioning and personalization. Systematic review revealed 242 different transdiagnostic outcome measures, with the 36-item Short-Form Survey for quality of life (SF36) being used most consistently, showing substantial overlap with the themes from the qualitative study. Comparing SF36 to HDRS scores in 26 studies revealed moderate to good correlations (0.62—0.79) and good positive predictive values (0.75—0.88). The NLP pipeline developed with notes from 22,170 patients reached an accuracy of 95 to 99 percent (F1 scores: 0.38 – 0.86) on detecting these themes, evaluated on data from 361 patients. Conclusions: The NLP pipeline developed in this study extracts outcome measures from the EHR that cater specifically to the needs of clinical staff and align with outcome measures used to detect treatment effects in clinical trials. © 2022, The Author(s).",2022,,BMC Psychiatry,22,1,,,10.1186/s12888-022-04058-z,,#1375,Turner 2022,"",""
Text mining for identifying the nature of online questions about non-suicidal self-injury,"Kim, M.-S.; Yu, J.","Objective: The internet provides convenient access to information about non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) owing to its accessibility and anonymity.

Methods: We searched for the keyword “non-suicidal self-injury” (Ja-Hae in Korean) in the Naver Q&A using the statistical package R. We analyzed 7893 NSSI-related questions posted between 2009 and 2018. Text mining was performed using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) on the dataset to determine associations between phrases and thus identify common themes in posts about NSSI. Results: In the LDA, we selected the following 10 most common topics: anger, family troubles, collecting information on NSSI, stress, concerns regarding NSSI scarring, ways to help a non-suicidal self-injurious friend, depression, medical advice, ways to perform or stop NSSI, and prejudices and thoughts regarding non-suicidal self-injurious people.

Mood detection and prediction using conventional machine learning techniques on COVID19 data,"Bhattacharya, S.; Agarwala, A.; Roy, S.","Emotion detection is a promising field of research in multiple perspectives such as psychology, marketing, network analysis and so on. Multiple models have been suggested over the years for accurate and efficient mood detection. Identifying emotion, or mood, from text has progressed from a simple frequency distribution analysis to far more complicated learning approaches. The main aim of all these text mining and analysis is twofold. First is to categorise existing text into broad classes of emotions, such as happy, sad, angry, surprised and so on. The second aim is to accurately predict the moods of real-time streaming text. The novelty of the work lies in the extensive comparison of nine conventional learning methods with respect to performance metrics precision, recall, F1 and accuracy as well as studying the variance of mood over time using a wide array of moods (25). Using conventional classifiers allow near real-time predictions, can work on considerably less training data, and has the flexibility of feature engineering, as deep learning methods have feature engineering embedded in the model. Since a single line of text can be associated with multiple emotions, this article compares the performance of classifiers in predicting multiple moods for streaming text with likelihood-based ranking. An android application named Citizens’ Sense was developed for text collection and analysis. The performance of mood classifiers are tested further using Twitter data related to COVID19. Based on the precision, recall, F1 and accuracy of the classifiers, it can be seen that Random Forest, Decision Tree and Complement Naive Bayes classifiers are marginally better than the other classifiers. The variance of mood over time, and predicted moods for text support this finding. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",2022,,Social Network Analysis and Mining,12,1,,,10.1007/s13278-022-00957-x,,#1379,Bhattacharya 2022,"",""
Emotional discourse analysis of COVID-19 patients and their mental health: A text mining study,"Deng, Y.; Park, M.; Chen, J.; Yang, J.; Xie, L.; Li, H.; Wang, L.; Chen, Y.","COVID-19 has caused negative emotional responses in patients, with significant mental health consequences for the infected population. The need for an in-depth analysis of the emotional state of COVID-19 patients is imperative. This study employed semi-structured interviews and the text mining method to investigate features in lived experience narratives of COVID-19 patients and healthy controls with respect to five basic emotions. The aim was to identify differences in emotional status between the two matched groups of participants. The results indicate generally higher complexity and more expressive emotional language in healthy controls than in COVID-19 patients. Specifically, narratives of fear, happiness, and sadness by COVID-19 patients were significantly shorter as compared to healthy controls. Regarding lexical features, COVID-19 patients used more emotional words, in particular words of fear, disgust, and happiness, as opposed to those used by healthy controls. Emotional disorder symptoms of COVID-19 patients at the lexical level tended to focus on the emotions of fear and disgust. They narrated more in relation to self or family while healthy controls mainly talked about others. Our automatic emotional discourse analysis potentially distinguishes clinical status of COVID-19 patients versus healthy controls, and can thus be used to predict mental health disorder symptoms in COVID-19 patients.  © 2022 Deng et al.

Natural language processing to identify case factors in child protection court proceedings,"Coulthard, B.; Taylor, B.J.","Social work case files hold rich detail about the lives and needs of vulnerable groups. Traditional case-reading studies to gain generalisable knowledge are resource-intensive, however, and sample sizes thereby limited. The advent of ‘big data’ technology, and vast repositories of centrally stored electronic records offer social work researchers novel alternatives, including data linkage and predictive risk modelling using administrative data. Free-text documents, however – including assessments, reports, and case chronologies – remain a largely untapped resource.

"Bio, psycho, or social: supervised machine learning to classify discursive framing of depression in online health communities","Németh, R.; Máté, F.; Katona, E.; Rakovics, M.; Sik, D.","Supervised machine learning on textual data has successful industrial/business applications, but it is an open question whether it can be utilized in social knowledge building outside the scope of hermeneutically more trivial cases. Combining sociology and data science raises several methodological and epistemological questions. In our study the discursive framing of depression is explored in online health communities. Three discursive frameworks are introduced: the bio-medical, psychological, and social framings of depression. ~80 000 posts were collected, and a sample of them was manually classified. Conventional bag-of-words models, Gradient Boosting Machine, word-embedding-based models and a state-of-the-art Transformer-based model with transfer learning, called DistilBERT were applied to expand this classification on the whole database. According to our experience ‘discursive framing’ proves to be a complex and hermeneutically difficult concept, which affects the degree of both inter-annotator agreement and predictive performance. Our finding confirms that the level of inter-annotator disagreement provides a good estimate for the objective difficulty of the classification. By identifying the most important terms, we also interpreted the classification algorithms, which is of great importance in social sciences. We are convinced that machine learning techniques can extend the horizon of qualitative text analysis.

Portability of natural language processing methods to detect suicidality from clinical text in US and UK electronic health records,"Cusick, M.; Velupillai, S.; Downs, J.; Campion, T.R.; Sholle, E.T.; Dutta, R.; Pathak, J.","Background: In the global effort to prevent death by suicide, many academic medical institutions are implementing natural language processing (NLP) approaches to detect suicidality from unstructured clinical text in electronic health records (EHRs), with the hope of targeting timely, preventative interventions to individuals most at risk of suicide. Despite the international need, the development of these NLP approaches in EHRs has been largely local and not shared across healthcare systems. Methods: In this study, we developed a process to share NLP approaches that were individually developed at King's College London (KCL), UK and Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM), US - two academic medical centers based in different countries with vastly different healthcare systems. We tested and compared the algorithms’ performance on manually annotated clinical notes (KCL: n = 4,911 and WCM = 837). Results: After a successful technical porting of the NLP approaches, our quantitative evaluation determined that independently developed NLP approaches can detect suicidality at another healthcare organization with a different EHR system, clinical documentation processes, and culture, yet do not achieve the same level of success as at the institution where the NLP algorithm was developed (KCL approach: F1-score 0.85 vs. 0.68, WCM approach: F1-score 0.87 vs. 0.72). Limitations: Independent NLP algorithm development and patient cohort selection at the two institutions comprised direct comparability. Conclusions: Shared use of these NLP approaches is a critical step forward towards improving data-driven algorithms for early suicide risk identification and timely prevention. © 2022",2022,,Journal of Affective Disorders Reports,10,,,,10.1016/j.jadr.2022.100430,,#1386,Cusick 2022,"",""
Negative emotions experienced by healthcare staff following medication administration errors: a descriptive study using text-mining and content analysis of incident data,"Mahat, S.; Rafferty, A.M.; Vehviläinen-Julkunen, K.; Härkänen, M.","Background: Medication errors regardless of the degree of patient harm can have a negative emotional impact on the healthcare staff involved. The potential for self-victimization of healthcare staff following medication errors can add to the moral distress of healthcare staff. The stigma associated with errors and their disclosure often haunts healthcare professionals, leading them to question their own professional competence. This paper investigates the negative emotions expressed by healthcare staff in their reported medication administration error incidents along with the immediate responses they received from their seniors and colleagues after the incident. Method: This is a retrospective study using a qualitative descriptive design and text mining. This study includes free-text descriptions of medication administration error incidents (n = 72,390) reported to National Reporting & Learning System in 2016 from England and Wales. Text-mining by SAS text miner and content analysis was used to analyse the data. Results: Analysis of data led to the extraction of 93 initial codes and two categories i.e., 1) negative emotions expressed by healthcare staff which included 4 sub-categories of feelings: (i) fear; (ii) disturbed; (iii) sadness; (iv) guilt and 2) Immediate response from seniors and colleagues which included 2 sub-categories: (i) Reassurance and support and (ii) Guidance on what to do after an error. Conclusion: Negative emotions expressed by healthcare staff when reporting medication errors could be a catalyst for learning and system change. However, negative emotions when internalized as fear, guilt, or self-blame, could have a negative impact on the mental health of individuals concerned, reporting culture, and opportunities for learning from the error.

Detection of Depression Severity Using Bengali Social Media Posts on Mental Health: Study Using Natural Language Processing Techniques,"Kabir, M.K.; Islam, M.; Binte Kabir, A.N.; Haque, A.; Rhaman, K.","Background: There are a myriad of language cues that indicate depression in written texts, and natural language processing (NLP) researchers have proven the ability of machine learning and deep learning approaches to detect these cues. However, to date, these approaches bridging NLP and the domain of mental health for Bengali literature are not comprehensive. The Bengali-speaking population can express emotions in their native language in greater detail. Objective: Our goal is to detect the severity of depression using Bengali texts by generating a novel Bengali corpus of depressive posts. We collaborated with mental health experts to generate a clinically sound labeling scheme and an annotated corpus to train machine learning and deep learning models. Methods: We conducted a study using Bengali text-based data from blogs and open source platforms. We constructed a procedure for annotated corpus generation and extraction of textual information from Bengali literature for predictive analysis. We developed our own structured data set and designed a clinically sound labeling scheme with the help of mental health professionals, adhering to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) during the process. We used 5 machine learning models for detecting the severity of depression: kernel support vector machine (SVM), random forest, logistic regression K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and complement naive Bayes (NB). For the deep learning approach, we used long short-term memory (LSTM) units and gated recurrent units (GRUs) coupled with convolutional blocks or self-attention layers. Finally, we aimed for enhanced outcomes by using state-of-the-art pretrained language models. Results: The independent recurrent neural network (RNN) models yielded the highest accuracies and weighted F1 scores. GRUs, in particular, produced 81% accuracy. The hybrid architectures could not surpass the RNNs in terms of performance. Kernel SVM with term frequency–inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) embeddings generated 78% accuracy on test data. We used validation and training loss curves to observe and report the performance of our architectures. Overall, the number of available data remained the limitation of our experiment. Conclusions: The findings from our experimental setup indicate that machine learning and deep learning models are fairly capable of assessing the severity of mental health issues from texts. For the future, we suggest more research endeavors to increase the volume of Bengali text data, in particular, so that modern architectures reach improved generalization capability. ©Muhammad Khubayeeb Kabir, Maisha Islam, Anika Nahian Binte Kabir, Adiba Haque, Md Khalilur Rhaman.",2022,,JMIR Formative Research,6,9,,,10.2196/36118,,#1393,Kabir 2022,"",""

There is a growing interest in the use of these novel data sources for epidemiological surveillance of substance use behaviors and trends. Objective: The key aims were to describe the development and application of the drug abuse ontology (DAO) as a framework for analyzing web-based and social media data to inform public health and substance use research in the following areas: determining user knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to nonmedical use of buprenorphine and illicitly manufactured opioids through the analysis of web forum data Prescription Drug Abuse Online Surveillance; analyzing patterns and trends of cannabis product use in the context of evolving cannabis legalization policies in the United States through analysis of Twitter and web forum data (eDrugTrends); assessing trends in the availability of novel synthetic opioids through the analysis of cryptomarket data (eDarkTrends); and analyzing COVID-19 pandemic trends in social media data related to 13 states in the United States as per Mental Health America reports. Methods: The domain and scope of the DAO were defined using competency questions from popular ontology methodology (101 ontology development). The 101 method includes determining the domain and scope of ontology, reusing existing knowledge, enumerating important terms in ontology, defining the classes, their properties and creating instances of the classes. The quality of the ontology was evaluated using a set of tools and best practices recognized by the semantic web community and the artificial intelligence community that engage in natural language processing. Results: The current version of the DAO comprises 315 classes, 31 relationships, and 814 instances among the classes. The ontology is flexible and can easily accommodate new concepts. The integration of the ontology with machine learning algorithms dramatically decreased the false alarm rate by adding external knowledge to the machine learning process. The ontology is recurrently updated to capture evolving concepts in different contexts and applied to analyze data related to social media and dark web marketplaces. Conclusions: The DAO provides a powerful framework and a useful resource that can be expanded and adapted to a wide range of substance use and mental health domains to help advance big data analytics of web-based data for substance use epidemiology research. © Usha Lokala, Francois Lamy, Raminta Daniulaityte, Manas Gaur, Amelie Gyrard, Krishnaprasad Thirunarayan, Ugur Kursuncu, Amit Sheth.",2022,,JMIR Public Health and Surveillance,8,12,,,10.2196/24938,,#1394,Lokala 2022,"",""

Neuroimmunological diseases, such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, multiple sclerosis, and depression, include various pathologies that result from the interaction between the central nervous system and the immune system. However, the repurposing of NI medications is hindered by the vast amount of information that needs mining. We previously presented Adera1.0, which was capable of text mining PubMed for answering query-based questions. However, Adera1.0 was not able to automatically identify chemical compounds within relevant sentences. To challenge the need for repurposing known medications for neuroimmunological diseases, we built a deep neural network named Adera2.0 to perform drug repurposing. The workflow uses three deep learning networks. The first network is an encoder and its main task is to embed text into matrices. The second network uses a mean squared error (MSE) loss function to predict answers in the form of embedded matrices. The third network, which constitutes the main novelty in our updated workflow, also uses a MSE loss function. Its main usage is to extract compound names from relevant sentences resulting from the previous network. To optimize the network function, we compared eight different designs. We found that a deep neural network consisting of an RNN neural network and a leaky ReLU could achieve 0.0001 loss and 67% sensitivity. Additionally, we validated Adera2.0’s ability to predict NI drug usage against the DRUG Repurposing Hub database. These results establish the ability of Adera2.0 to repurpose drug candidates that can shorten the development of the drug cycle. The workflow could be download online. © 2022 by the authors.",2022,,Molecules,27,19,,,10.3390/molecules27196453,,#1396,Lazarczyk 2022,"",""
Detecting Signs of Non-suicidal Self-Injury in Psychiatric Medical Reports Using Language Analysis,"Martinez-Romo, J.; Reneses, B.; Martínez-Capella, I.; Araujo, L.; Sevilla-Llewellyn-Jones, J.; Seara-Aguilar, G.","Non-suicidal self-injury, often referred to as self-injury, is the act of deliberately harming one’s own body, such as cutting or burning oneself. It is not usually intended as a suicide attempt. This paper presents a system for detecting signs of non-suicidal self-injury, based on language analysis, on an annotated set of medical reports obtained from the psychiatric service of a public hospital in Madrid. Both explainability and accuracy in predicting positive cases are the two main objectives of this work. In order to achieve this goal, two supervised systems of different natures have been developed. On the one hand, a process of extraction of different features focused on the world of self-injury itself has been carried out using natural language processing techniques to subsequently feed a traditional classifier. On the other hand, a deep learning system based on several layers of convolutional neural networks, due to its high performance in text classification tasks. The result are two supervised systems with high performance, where we highlight the system based on a traditional classifier due to its better prediction of positive classes and the greater ease to explain its results to health professionals. © 2022 Sociedad Española para el Procesamiento del Lenguaje Natural.",2022,,Procesamiento del Lenguaje Natural,69,,129-140,,10.26342/2022-69-11,,#1399,Martinez-Romo 2022,"",""
Consumer perceptions of telehealth for mental health or substance abuse: A Twitter-based topic modeling analysis,"Baird, A.; Xia, Y.; Cheng, Y.","Objective: The objective of this study is to understand the primary topics of consumer discussion on Twitter associated with telehealth for mental health or substance abuse for prepandemic versus during-pandemic time-periods, using a state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) natural language processing (NLP) method. Materials and Methods: The primary methodological phases of this project were: (1) collecting, cleaning, and filtering data (tweets) from January 2014 to June 2021, (2) describing the final corpus, (3) running and optimizing Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT; using BERTopic in Python) models, and (4) human refinement of topic model results and thematic classification of topics. Results: The number of tweets in this context increased by 4 times during the pandemic (2017 tweets prepandemic vs 8672 tweets during the pandemic). During the pandemic topics were more frequently mental health related than substance abuse related. Top during-pandemic topics were therapy, suicide, pain (associated with burnout and drinking), and mental health diagnoses such as ADHD and autism. Anxiety was a key topic of discussion both pre- and during the pandemic. Discussion: Telehealth for mental health and substance abuse is being discussed more frequently online, which implies growing demand. Given the topics extracted as proxies for demand, the most demand is currently for telehealth for mental health primarily, especially for children, parents, and therapy for those with anxiety or depression, and substance abuse secondarily. Conclusions: Scarce telehealth resources can be allocated more efficiently if topics of consumer discussion are included in resource allocation decision- and policy-making processes. © 2022 The Author(s).

Increased Online Aggression During COVID-19 Lockdowns: Two-Stage Study of Deep Text Mining and Difference-in-Differences Analysis,"Hsu, J.T.-H.; Tsai, R.T.-H.","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic caused a critical public health crisis worldwide, and policymakers are using lockdowns to control the virus. However, there has been a noticeable increase in aggressive social behaviors that threaten social stability. Lockdown measures might negatively affect mental health and lead to an increase in aggressive emotions. Discovering the relationship between lockdown and increased aggression is crucial for formulating appropriate policies that address these adverse societal effects. We applied natural language processing (NLP) technology to internet data, so as to investigate the social and emotional impacts of lockdowns. Objective: This research aimed to understand the relationship between lockdown and increased aggression using NLP technology to analyze the following 3 kinds of aggressive emotions: anger, offensive language, and hate speech, in spatiotemporal ranges of tweets in the United States. Methods: We conducted a longitudinal internet study of 11,455 Twitter users by analyzing aggressive emotions in 1,281,362 tweets they posted from 2019 to 2020. We selected 3 common aggressive emotions (anger, offensive language, and hate speech) on the internet as the subject of analysis. To detect the emotions in the tweets, we trained a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model to analyze the percentage of aggressive tweets in every state and every week. Then, we used the difference-in-differences estimation to measure the impact of lockdown status on increasing aggressive tweets. Since most other independent factors that might affect the results, such as seasonal and regional factors, have been ruled out by time and state fixed effects, a significant result in this difference-in-differences analysis can not only indicate a concrete positive correlation but also point to a causal relationship. Results: In the first 6 months of lockdown in 2020, aggression levels in all users increased compared to the same period in 2019. Notably, users under lockdown demonstrated greater levels of aggression than those not under lockdown. Our difference-in-differences estimation discovered a statistically significant positive correlation between lockdown and increased aggression (anger: P=.002, offensive language: P<.001, hate speech: P=.005). It can be inferred from such results that there exist causal relations. Conclusions: Understanding the relationship between lockdown and aggression can help policymakers address the personal and societal impacts of lockdown. Applying NLP technology and using big data on social media can provide crucial and timely information for this effort. © 2022 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Depression prognosis using natural language processing and machine learning from social media status,"Hossain, M.T.; Talukder, M.A.R.; Jahan, N.","Depression is an acute problem throughout the world. Due to worst and prolong depression many people dies in every year. The problem is that most of the people are not concern of the fact that they are suffering from depression. In this research, our aim was to find out whether an individual is depressed or not by analyzing social media status. Therefore, we focused on real data. Our dataset consists of 2,000 sentences, which was collected from different social media platforms Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Then, we have performed five data pre-processing approaches for natural language processing (NLP) such as tokenization, removal of stop words, removing empty string, removing punctuations, stemming and lemmatization. For our selected model, we considered that processed data as an input. Finally, we applied six machine learning (ML) classifiers multinomial Naive Bayes (NB), logistic regression, liner support vector classifier, random forest, K-nearest neighbour, and decision tree to achieve better accuracy over our dataset.

Federated learning for violence incident prediction in a simulated cross-institutional psychiatric setting,"Borger, T.; Mosteiro, P.; Kaya, H.; Rijcken, E.; Salah, A.A.; Scheepers, F.; Spruit, M.","Inpatient violence is a common and severe problem within psychiatry. Knowing who might become violent can influence staffing levels and mitigate severity. Predictive machine learning models can assess each patient's likelihood of becoming violent based on clinical notes. Yet, while machine learning models benefit from having more data, data availability is limited as hospitals typically do not share their data for privacy preservation. Federated Learning (FL) can overcome the problem of data limitation by training models in a decentralised manner, without disclosing data between collaborators. However, although several FL approaches exist, none of these train Natural Language Processing models on clinical notes. In this work, we investigate the application of Federated Learning to clinical Natural Language Processing, applied to the task of Violence Risk Assessment by simulating a cross-institutional psychiatric setting. We train and compare four models: two local models, a federated model and a data-centralised model. Our results indicate that the federated model outperforms the local models and has similar performance as the data-centralised model. These findings suggest that Federated Learning can be used successfully in a cross-institutional setting and is a step towards new applications of Federated Learning based on clinical notes. © 2022 The Authors",2022,,Expert Systems with Applications,199,,,,10.1016/j.eswa.2022.116720,,#1408,Borger 2022,"",""
The Case of Aspect in Sentiment Analysis: Seeking Attention or Co-Dependency?,"Žunić, A.; Corcoran, P.; Spasić, I.","(1) Background: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (SA) is a natural language processing task, the aim of which is to classify the sentiment associated with a specific aspect of a written text.

(2) Methods: In this study, we present an approach to aspect-based SA of drug reviews. Specifically, we analysed signs and symptoms, which were extracted automatically using the Unified Medical Language System. This information was then passed onto the BERT language model, which was extended by two layers to fine-tune the model for aspect-based SA. The interpretability of the model was analysed using an axiomatic attribution method. We performed a correlation analysis between the attribution scores and syntactic dependencies.

Suicidal ideation in dementia: associations with neuropsychiatric symptoms and subtype diagnosis,"Naismith, H.; Howard, R.; Stewart, R.; Pitman, A.; Mueller, C.","ABSTRACT Objectives: To investigate factors associated with suicidal ideation (SI) around the time of dementia diagnosis. We hypothesised relatively preserved cognition, co-occurring physical and psychiatric disorders, functional impairments, and dementia diagnosis subtype would be associated with a higher risk of SI. Design: Cross-sectional study using routinely collected electronic mental healthcare records. Setting: National Health Service secondary mental healthcare services in South London, UK, serving a population of over 1.36 million residents. Participants: Patients who received a diagnosis of dementia (Alzheimer's, vascular, mixed Alzheimer's/vascular, or dementia with Lewy bodies) between 1 Nov 2007-31 Oct 2021: 18,252 people were identified during the observation period. Measurements: A natural language processing algorithm was used to identify recorded clinician recording of SI around the time of dementia diagnosis. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were also measured around the time of diagnosis. We compared people diagnosed with non-Alzheimer's dementia to those with Alzheimer's and used statistical models to adjust for putative confounders. Results: 15.1% of patients had recorded SI, which was more common in dementia with Lewy bodies compared to other dementia diagnoses studied. After adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical factors, SI was more frequent in those with depression and dementia with Lewy bodies and less common in those with impaired activities of daily living and in vascular dementia. Agitated behavior and hallucinations were not associated with SI in the final model. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the importance of identifying and treating depressive symptoms in people with dementia and the need for further research into under-researched dementia subtypes.  © ",2022,,International Psychogeriatrics,34,4,399-406,,10.1017/S1041610222000126,,#1416,Naismith 2022,"",""
"The Impact of Shanghai Epidemic, China, 2022 on Public Psychology: A Sentiment Analysis of Microblog Users by Data Mining","Wang, Z.; Qin, Y.","The Shanghai epidemic (COVID-19) is another large-scale epidemic in China’s central cities in the post-epidemic era from the end of March 2022. It is of great significance to study the public’s attitude towards the Shanghai epidemic to support healthy psychology and a positive attitude. This study used crawler technology to obtain the Weibo data related to the epidemic situation in Shanghai that was published by users. The crawled microblogs were preprocessed, and the BosonNLP sentiment dictionary for attitude classification was selected. The Chinese vocabulary ontology for 21 emotion classifications was also used. The results showed that the general attitude of the public in Shanghai was positive. This fluctuated greatly in the initial stage and gradually increased in the later stage. Through text mining, it is clear that goods and materials, nucleic acid virus testing, and other aspects of the epidemic in Shanghai are concerning for the public. The public attitude in areas that are close to the epidemic center is relatively more negative.

Development and multimodal validation of a substance misuse algorithm for referral to treatment using artificial intelligence (SMART-AI): a retrospective deep learning study,"Afshar, M.; Sharma, B.; Dligach, D.; Oguss, M.; Brown, R.; Chhabra, N.; Thompson, H.M.; Markossian, T.; Joyce, C.; Churpek, M.M.; Karnik, N.S.","Background: Substance misuse is a heterogeneous and complex set of behavioural conditions that are highly prevalent in hospital settings and frequently co-occur. Few hospital-wide solutions exist to comprehensively and reliably identify these conditions to prioritise care and guide treatment. The aim of this study was to apply natural language processing (NLP) to clinical notes collected in the electronic health record (EHR) to accurately screen for substance misuse. Methods: The model was trained and developed on a reference dataset derived from a hospital-wide programme at Rush University Medical Center (RUMC), Chicago, IL, USA, that used structured diagnostic interviews to manually screen admitted patients over 27 months (between Oct 1, 2017, and Dec 31, 2019; n=54 915). The Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test and Drug Abuse Screening Tool served as reference standards. The first 24 h of notes in the EHR were mapped to standardised medical vocabulary and fed into single-label, multilabel, and multilabel with auxillary-task neural network models. Temporal validation of the model was done using data from the subsequent 12 months on a subset of RUMC patients (n=16 917). External validation was done using data from Loyola University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA between Jan 1, 2007, and Sept 30, 2017 (n=1991 adult patients). The primary outcome was discrimination for alcohol misuse, opioid misuse, or non-opioid drug misuse. Discrimination was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Calibration slope and intercept were measured with the unreliability index. Bias assessments were performed across demographic subgroups. Findings: The model was trained on a cohort that had 3·5% misuse (n=1 921) with any type of substance. 220 (11%) of 1921 patients with substance misuse had more than one type of misuse. The multilabel convolutional neural network classifier had a mean AUROC of 0·97 (95% CI 0·96–0·98) during temporal validation for all types of substance misuse. The model was well calibrated and showed good face validity with model features containing explicit mentions of aberrant drug-taking behaviour. A false-negative rate of 0·18–0·19 and a false-positive rate of 0·03 between non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White groups occurred. In external validation, the AUROCs for alcohol and opioid misuse were 0·88 (95% CI 0·86–0·90) and 0·94 (0·92–0·95), respectively. Interpretation: We developed a novel and accurate approach to leveraging the first 24 h of EHR notes for screening multiple types of substance misuse.

Suicide theory-guided natural language processing of clinical progress notes to improve prediction of veteran suicide risk: Protocol for a mixed-method study,"Meerwijk, E.L.; Tamang, S.R.; Finlay, A.K.; Ilgen, M.A.; Reeves, R.M.; Harris, A.H.S.","Introduction The state-of-the-art 3-step Theory of Suicide (3ST) describes why people consider suicide and who will act on their suicidal thoughts and attempt suicide. The central concepts of 3ST - psychological pain, hopelessness, connectedness, and capacity for suicide - are among the most important drivers of suicidal behaviour but they are missing from clinical suicide risk prediction models in use at the US Veterans Health Administration (VHA). These four concepts are not systematically recorded in structured fields of VHA's electronic healthcare records. Therefore, this study will develop a domain-specific ontology that will enable automated extraction of these concepts from clinical progress notes using natural language processing (NLP), and test whether NLP-based predictors for these concepts improve accuracy of existing VHA suicide risk prediction models. Methods and analysis Our mixed-method study has an exploratory sequential design where a qualitative component (aim 1) will inform quantitative analyses (aims 2 and 3). For aim 1, subject matter experts will manually annotate progress notes of clinical encounters with veterans who attempted or died by suicide to develop a domain-specific ontology for the 3ST concepts. During aim 2, we will use NLP to machine-annotate clinical progress notes and derive longitudinal representations for each patient with respect to the presence and intensity of hopelessness, psychological pain, connectedness and capacity for suicide in temporal proximity of suicide attempts and deaths by suicide. These longitudinal representations will be evaluated during aim 3 for their ability to improve existing VHA prediction models of suicide and suicide attempts, STORM (Stratification Tool for Opioid Risk Mitigation) and REACHVET (Recovery Engagement and Coordination for Health - Veterans Enhanced Treatment).

Predicting Personality and Psychological Distress Using Natural Language Processing: A Study Protocol,"Jang, J.; Yoon, S.; Son, G.; Kang, M.; Choeh, J.Y.; Choi, K.-H.","Background: Self-report multiple choice questionnaires have been widely utilized to quantitatively measure one’s personality and psychological constructs. Despite several strengths (e.g., brevity and utility), self-report multiple choice questionnaires have considerable limitations in nature. With the rise of machine learning (ML) and Natural language processing (NLP), researchers in the field of psychology are widely adopting NLP to assess psychological construct to predict human behaviors. However, there is a lack of connections between the work being performed in computer science and that of psychology due to small data sets and unvalidated modeling practices. Aims: The current article introduces the study method and procedure of phase II which includes the interview questions for the five-factor model (FFM) of personality developed in phase I. This study aims to develop the interview (semi-structured) and open-ended questions for the FFM-based personality assessments, specifically designed with experts in the field of clinical and personality psychology (phase 1), and to collect the personality-related text data using the interview questions and self-report measures on personality and psychological distress (phase 2). The purpose of the study includes examining the relationship between natural language data obtained from the interview questions, measuring the FFM personality constructs, and psychological distress to demonstrate the validity of the natural language-based personality prediction. Methods: Phase I (pilot) study was conducted to fifty-nine native Korean adults to acquire the personality-related text data from the interview (semi-structured) and open-ended questions based on the FFM of personality. The interview questions were revised and finalized with the feedback from the external expert committee, consisting of personality and clinical psychologists. Based on the established interview questions, a total of 300 Korean adults will be recruited using a convenience sampling method via online survey.

Difficult-to-treat depression (DTD) is a new concept that describes ‘depression that continues to cause significant burden despite usual treatment efforts’. Aims: To identify patients with likely DTD in UK secondary care and examine demographic, disease and treatment data as compared with ‘non-DTD’ MDD patients. Methods: Anonymised electronic health records (EHRs) of five specialist mental health National Health Service (NHS) Trusts in the United Kingdom were analysed using a natural language processing model. Data on disease characteristics, comorbidities and treatment histories were extracted from structured fields and using natural language algorithms from unstructured fields. Patients with MDD aged ⩾18 years were included in the analysis; those with presumed DTD were identified on the basis of MDD history (duration and recurrence) and number of treatments prescribed. Results: In a sample of 28,184 patients with MDD, 19% met criteria for DTD. Compared to the non-DTD group, patients with DTD were more likely to have severe depression, suicidal ideation, and comorbid psychiatric and/or physical illness, as well as higher rates of hospitalisation. They were also more likely to be in receipt of unemployment and sickness/disability benefits. More intensive treatment strategies were used in the DTD group, including higher rates of combination therapy, augmentation, psychotherapy and electroconvulsive therapy.

A Multilingual Neural Coaching Model with Enhanced Long-term Dialogue Structure,"Zorrilla, A.L.; Torres, M.I.","In this work we develop a fully data driven conversational agent capable of carrying out motivational coaching sessions in Spanish, French, Norwegian, and English. Unlike the majority of coaching, and in general well-being related conversational agents that can be found in the literature, ours is not designed by hand-crafted rules. Instead, we directly model the coaching strategy of professionals with end users. To this end, we gather a set of virtual coaching sessions through a Wizard of Oz platform, and apply state of the art Natural Language Processing techniques. We employ a transfer learning approach, pretraining GPT2 neural language models and fine-tuning them on our corpus. However, since these only take as input a local dialogue history, a simple fine-tuning procedure is not capable of modeling the long-term dialogue strategies that appear in coaching sessions. To alleviate this issue, we first propose to learn dialogue phase and scenario embeddings in the fine-tuning stage. These indicate to the model at which part of the dialogue it is and which kind of coaching session it is carrying out. Second, we develop a global deep learning system which controls the long-term structure of the dialogue. We also show that this global module can be used to visualize and interpret the decisions taken by the the conversational agent, and that the learnt representations are comparable to dialogue acts. Automatic and human evaluation show that our proposals serve to improve the baseline models. Finally, interaction experiments with coaching experts indicate that the system is usable and gives rise to positive emotions in Spanish, French and English, while the results in Norwegian point out that there is still work to be done in fully data driven approaches with very low resource languages.  © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

In this study, we show how natural language processing (NLP) can help identify LE in clinical notes at higher rates than reported medical codes. We compare domain-specific lexicons formulated from Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) selection, content analysis by subject matter experts (SME) and the Gravity Project, to data-driven expansion through contextual word embedding using Word2Vec. Our analysis covers EHR from the Veterans Affairs (VA) Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) and measures the prevalence of LE across time for patients with known underlying cause of death in the National Death Index (NDI). We found that NLP methods had higher sensitivity of detecting LE relative to structured EHR (S-EHR) variables. We observed that, on average, suicide cases had higher rates of LE over time when compared to patients who died of non-suicide related causes with no previous history of diagnosed mental illness. When used to discriminate these outcomes, the inclusion of NLP derived variables increased the concentration of LE along the top 0.1%, 0.5% and 1% of predicted risk. LE were less informative when discriminating suicide death from non-suicide related death for patients with diagnosed mental illness. © 2022",2022,,Journal of Psychiatric Research,151,,328-338,,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.04.009,,#1437,Morrow 2022,"",""
"How Did People Cope During the COVID-19 Pandemic? A Structural Topic Modelling Analysis of Free-Text Data From 11,000 United Kingdom Adults","Wright, L.; Fluharty, M.; Steptoe, A.; Fancourt, D.","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has had substantial impacts on lives across the globe. Job losses have been widespread, and individuals have experienced significant restrictions on their usual activities, including extended isolation from family and friends. While studies suggest population mental health worsened from before the pandemic, not all individuals appear to have experienced poorer mental health. This raises the question of how people managed to cope during the pandemic. Methods: To understand the coping strategies individuals employed during the COVID-19 pandemic, we used structural topic modelling, a text mining technique, to extract themes from free-text data on coping from over 11,000 UK adults, collected between 14 October and 26 November 2020. Results: We identified 16 topics. The most discussed coping strategy was ‘thinking positively’ and involved themes of gratefulness and positivity. Other strategies included engaging in activities and hobbies (such as doing DIY, exercising, walking and spending time in nature), keeping routines, and focusing on one day at a time. Some participants reported more avoidant coping strategies, such as drinking alcohol and binge eating. Coping strategies varied by respondent characteristics including age, personality traits and sociodemographic characteristics and some coping strategies, such as engaging in creative activities, were associated with more positive lockdown experiences. Conclusion: A variety of coping strategies were employed by individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. The coping strategy an individual adopted was related to their overall lockdown experiences. This may be useful for helping individuals prepare for future lockdowns or other events resulting in self-isolation.

Doing well-being: Self-reported activities are related to subjective well-being,"Nilsson, A.H.; Hellryd, E.; Kjell, O.","Activities and Subjective Well-Being (SWB) have been shown to be intricately related to each other. However, no research to date has shown whether individuals understand how their everyday activities relate to their SWB. Furthermore, the assessment of activities has been limited to predefined types of activities and/or closed-ended questions. In two studies, we examine the relationship between self-reported everyday activities and SWB, while allowing individuals to express their activities freely by allowing open-ended responses that were then analyzed with state-of-the-art (transformers-based) Natural Language Processing. In study 1 (N = 284), self-reports of Yesterday’s Activities did not significantly relate to SWB, whereas activities reported as having the most impact on SWB in the past four weeks had small but significant correlations to most of the SWB scales (r = .14 –.23, p < .05). In Study 2 (N = 295), individuals showed strong agreement with each other about activities that they considered to increase or decrease SWB (AUC = .995). Words describing activities that increased SWB related to physically and cognitively active activities and social activities (“football”, “meditation”, “friends”), whereas words describing activities that decreased SWB were mainly activity features related to imbalance (“too”, “much”, “enough”). Individuals reported both activities and descriptive words that reflect their SWB, where the activity words had generally small but significant correlations to SWB (r =. 17 –.33, p < .05) and the descriptive words had generally strong correlations to SWB (r = .39–63, p < .001). We call this correlational gap the well-being/activity description gap and discuss possible explanations for the phenomenon. Copyright: © 2022 Nilsson et al.

Detecting Language Associated with Home Healthcare Patient's Risk for Hospitalization and Emergency Department Visit,"Song, J.; Ojo, M.; Bowles, K.H.; McDonald, M.V.; Cato, K.; Rossetti, S.C.; Adams, V.; Chae, S.; Hobensack, M.; Kennedy, E.; Tark, A.; Kang, M.-J.; Woo, K.; Barrón, Y.; Sridharan, S.; Topaz, M.","Background About one in five patients receiving home healthcare (HHC) services are hospitalized or visit an emergency department (ED) during a home care episode. Early identification of at-risk patients can prevent these negative outcomes. However, risk indicators, including language in clinical notes that indicate a concern about a patient, are often hidden in narrative documentation throughout their HHC episode. Objective The aim of the study was to develop an automated natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to identify concerning language indicative of HHC patients' risk of hospitalizations or ED visits. Methods This study used the Omaha System - a standardized nursing terminology that describes problems/signs/symptoms that can occur in the community setting. First, five HHC experts iteratively reviewed the Omaha System and identified concerning concepts indicative of HHC patients' risk of hospitalizations or ED visits. Next, we developed and tested an NLP algorithm to identify these concerning concepts in HHC clinical notes automatically. The resulting NLP algorithm was applied on a large subset of narrative notes (2.3 million notes) documented for 66,317 unique patients (n = 87,966 HHC episodes) admitted to one large HHC agency in the Northeast United States between 2015 and 2017. Results A total of 160 Omaha System signs/symptoms were identified as concerning concepts for hospitalizations or ED visits in HHC. These signs/symptoms belong to 31 of the 42 available Omaha System problems. Overall, the NLP algorithm showed good performance in identifying concerning concepts in clinical notes. More than 18% of clinical notes were detected as having at least one concerning concept, and more than 90% of HHC episodes included at least one Omaha System problem. The most frequently documented concerning concepts were pain, followed by issues related to neuromusculoskeletal function, circulation, mental health, and communicable/infectious conditions. Conclusion Our findings suggest that concerning problems or symptoms that could increase the risk of hospitalization or ED visit were frequently documented in narrative clinical notes. NLP can automatically extract information from narrative clinical notes to improve our understanding of care needs in HHC. Next steps are to evaluate which concerning concepts identified in clinical notes predict hospitalization or ED visit.  © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Using Natural Language Processing to Explore Mental Health Insights From UK Tweets During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Infodemiology Study,"Marshall, C.; Lanyi, K.; Green, R.; Wilkins, G.C.; Pearson, F.; Craig, D.","Background: There is need to consider the value of soft intelligence, leveraged using accessible natural language processing (NLP) tools, as a source of analyzed evidence to support public health research outputs and decision-making. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the value of soft intelligence analyzed using NLP. As a case study, we selected and used a commercially available NLP platform to identify, collect, and interrogate a large collection of UK tweets relating to mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A search strategy comprised of a list of terms related to mental health, COVID-19, and lockdown restrictions was developed to prospectively collate relevant tweets via Twitter's advanced search application programming interface over a 24-week period. We deployed a readily and commercially available NLP platform to explore tweet frequency and sentiment across the United Kingdom and identify key topics of discussion. A series of keyword filters were used to clean the initial data retrieved and also set up to track specific mental health problems. All collated tweets were anonymized. Results: We identified and analyzed 286,902 tweets posted from UK user accounts from July 23, 2020 to January 6, 2021. The average sentiment score was 50%, suggesting overall neutral sentiment across all tweets over the study period. Major fluctuations in volume (between 12,622 and 51,340) and sentiment (between 25% and 49%) appeared to coincide with key changes to any local and/or national social distancing measures. Tweets around mental health were polarizing, discussed with both positive and negative sentiment. Key topics of consistent discussion over the study period included the impact of the pandemic on people's mental health (both positively and negatively), fear and anxiety over lockdowns, and anger and mistrust toward the government. Conclusions: Using an NLP platform, we were able to rapidly mine and analyze emerging health-related insights from UK tweets into how the pandemic may be impacting people's mental health and well-being. This type of real-time analyzed evidence could act as a useful intelligence source that agencies, local leaders, and health care decision makers can potentially draw from, particularly during a health crisis.  © Christopher Marshall, Kate Lanyi, Rhiannon Green, Georgina C Wilkins, Fiona Pearson, Dawn Craig.",2022,,JMIR Infodemiology,2,1,,,10.2196/32449,,#1442,Marshall 2022,"",""
Discursive construction of social representations expressed by seekers of psychosocial healthcare services in Brazil,"Faleiros, V.D.P.; Hochdorn, A.","Background: The current paper discusses the results of a study realized with 66 seekers of 12 psychosocial healthcare services (CAPS) in Brazil, by investigating their social representations. Aims: Throughout a quali-quantitative approach, unstructured interviews have been conducted and focused on two themes: one related to mental suffering and another to the CAPS itself. Method: The data were processed adopting the Iramuteq software for text-mining-analysis. Results: Out of the findings emerged four lexical classes due to the discursive representation of: (1) CAPS (39.7%); (2) social life (29.7%); (3) family (13.6%) and (4) medication and care (17%), where the utterance NÃO (NO) occupies a central position. Accordingly, the NO is associated with ‘not there’ and ‘not here’, contrasting the care provided outside the CAPS, represented as inhumane or inadequate, to that provided inside the CAPS, linked to feelings of ‘not being discriminated, mistreated and unrecognized’. The underlying social representations expressed in the interviews show an opposition between what was experienced outside and what was experienced inside the CAPS. Conclusion: The care received in CAPS units is the expression of a new psychosocial paradigm in a process of implementation, focused on participation and interdisciplinarity, as opposed to the biomedical paradigm focused on the disease. © The Author(s) 2021.",2022,,International Journal of Social Psychiatry,68,3,564-574,,10.1177/0020764021991875,,#1445,Faleiros 2022,"",""
Exploring the Association of Cancer and Depression in Electronic Health Records: Combining Encoded Diagnosis and Mining Free-Text Clinical Notes,"Leis, A.; Casadevall, D.; Albanell, J.; Posso, M.; Macià, F.; Castells, X.; Ramírez-Anguita, J.M.; Roldán, J.M.; Furlong, L.I.; Sanz, F.; Ronzano, F.; Mayer, M.A.","Background: A cancer diagnosis is a source of psychological and emotional stress, which are often maintained for sustained periods of time that may lead to depressive disorders. Depression is one of the most common psychological conditions in patients with cancer. According to the Global Cancer Observatory, breast and colorectal cancers are the most prevalent cancers in both sexes and across all age groups in Spain. Objective: This study aimed to compare the prevalence of depression in patients before and after the diagnosis of breast or colorectal cancer, as well as to assess the usefulness of the analysis of free-text clinical notes in 2 languages (Spanish or Catalan) for detecting depression in combination with encoded diagnoses. Methods: We carried out an analysis of the electronic health records from a general hospital by considering the different sources of clinical information related to depression in patients with breast and colorectal cancer. This analysis included ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) diagnosis codes and unstructured information extracted by mining free-text clinical notes via natural language processing tools based on Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms that mentions symptoms and drugs used for the treatment of depression. Results: We observed that the percentage of patients diagnosed with depressive disorders significantly increased after cancer diagnosis in the 2 types of cancer considered-breast and colorectal cancers. We managed to identify a higher number of patients with depression by mining free-text clinical notes than the group selected exclusively on ICD-9-CM codes, increasing the number of patients diagnosed with depression by 34.8% (441/1269). In addition, the number of patients with depression who received chemotherapy was higher than those who did not receive this treatment, with significant differences (P < .001). Conclusions: This study provides new clinical evidence of the depression-cancer comorbidity and supports the use of natural language processing for extracting and analyzing free-text clinical notes from electronic health records, contributing to the identification of additional clinical data that complements those provided by coded data to improve the management of these patients. © Angela Leis, David Casadevall, Joan Albanell, Margarita Posso, Francesc Macià, Xavier Castells, Juan Manuel Ramírez-Anguita, Jordi Martínez Roldán, Laura I Furlong, Ferran Sanz, Francesco Ronzano, Miguel A Mayer",2022,,JMIR Cancer,8,3,,,10.2196/39003,,#1446,Leis 2022,"",""

Setting The South London and Maudsley Clinical Record Interactive Search database. Participants All patients presenting with unipolar depression between 1 April 2006 and 31 March 2018. Exposure (1) Symptoms of mania: Elation; Grandiosity; Flight of ideas; Irritability; Pressured speech. (2) Symptoms of depression: Disturbed mood; Anhedonia; Guilt; Hopelessness; Helplessness; Worthlessness; Tearfulness; Low energy; Reduced appetite; Weight loss. (3) Symptoms of mania or depression (overlapping symptoms): Poor concentration; Insomnia; Disturbed sleep; Agitation; Mood instability. Main outcomes (1) Bipolar or psychotic disorder diagnosis. (2) Psychiatric hospital admission. Results Out of 19 707 patients, at least 1 depression, overlapping or mania symptom was present in 18 998 (96.4%), 15 954 (81.0%) and 4671 (23.7%) patients, respectively. 2772 (14.1%) patients subsequently developed bipolar or psychotic disorder during the follow-up period. The presence of at least one mania (HR 2.00, 95% CI 1.85 to 2.16), overlapping symptom (HR 1.71, 95% CI 1.52 to 1.92) or symptom of depression (HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.61) were associated with significantly increased risk of onset of a bipolar or psychotic disorder.

Case-control study of neuropsychiatric symptoms in electronic health records following COVID-19 hospitalization in 2 academic health systems,"Castro, V.M.; Rosand, J.; Giacino, J.T.; McCoy, T.H.; Perlis, R.H.","Neuropsychiatric symptoms may persist following acute COVID-19 illness, but the extent to which these symptoms are specific to COVID-19 has not been established. We utilized electronic health records across 6 hospitals in Massachusetts to characterize cohorts of individuals discharged following admission for COVID-19 between March 2020 and May 2021, and compared them to individuals hospitalized for other indications during this period. Natural language processing was applied to narrative clinical notes to identify neuropsychiatric symptom domains up to 150 days following hospitalization, in addition to those reflected in diagnostic codes as measured in prior studies. Among 6619 individuals hospitalized for COVID-19 drawn from a total of 42,961 hospital discharges, the most commonly-documented symptom domains between 31 and 90 days after initial positive test were fatigue (13.4%), mood and anxiety symptoms (11.2%), and impaired cognition (8.0%). In regression models adjusted for sociodemographic features and hospital course, none of these were significantly more common among COVID-19 patients; indeed, mood and anxiety symptoms were less frequent (adjusted OR 0.72 95% CI 0.64–0.92). Between 91 and 150 days after positivity, most commonly-detected symptoms were fatigue (10.9%), mood and anxiety symptoms (8.2%), and sleep disruption (6.8%), with impaired cognition in 5.8%. Frequency was again similar among non-COVID-19 post-hospital patients, with mood and anxiety symptoms less common (aOR 0.63, 95% CI 0.52–0.75). Propensity-score matched analyses yielded similar results. Overall, neuropsychiatric symptoms were common up to 150 days after initial hospitalization, but occurred at generally similar rates among individuals hospitalized for other indications during the same period.

Asian hate speech detection on Twitter during COVID-19,"Toliyat, A.; Levitan, S.I.; Peng, Z.; Etemadpour, R.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, and after being utterly contagious in Asian countries, it rapidly spread to other countries. This disease caused governments worldwide to declare a public health crisis with severe measures taken to reduce the speed of the spread of the disease. This pandemic affected the lives of millions of people. Many citizens that lost their loved ones and jobs experienced a wide range of emotions, such as disbelief, shock, concerns about health, fear about food supplies, anxiety, and panic. All of the aforementioned phenomena led to the spread of racism and hate against Asians in western countries, especially in the United States. An analysis of official preliminary police data by the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University shows that Anti-Asian hate crime in 16 of America's largest cities increased by 149% in 2020. In this study, we first chose a baseline of Americans' hate crimes against Asians on Twitter. Then we present an approach to balance the biased dataset and consequently improve the performance of tweet classification. We also have downloaded 10 million tweets through the Twitter API V-2. In this study, we have used a small portion of that, and we will use the entire dataset in the future study. In this article, three thousand tweets from our collected corpus are annotated by four annotators, including three Asian and one Asian-American. Using this data, we built predictive models of hate speech using various machine learning and deep learning methods. Our machine learning methods include Random Forest, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes. Our Deep Learning models include Basic Long-Term Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM with Drop out, Convolution, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). We also adjusted our dataset by filtering tweets that were ambiguous to the annotators based on low Fleiss Kappa agreement between annotators. Our final result showed that Logistic Regression achieved the best statistical machine learning performance with an F1 score of 0.72, while BERT achieved the best performance of the deep learning models, with an F1-Score of 0.85.

Deep Learning-based detection of psychiatric attributes from German mental health records,"Madan, S.; Julius Zimmer, F.; Balabin, H.; Schaaf, S.; Fröhlich, H.; Fluck, J.; Neuner, I.; Mathiak, K.; Hofmann-Apitius, M.; Sarkheil, P.","Background: Health care records provide large amounts of data with real-world and longitudinal aspects, which is advantageous for predictive analyses and improvements in personalized medicine. Text-based records are a main source of information in mental health. Therefore, application of text mining to the electronic health records – especially mental state examination – is a key approach for detection of psychiatric disease phenotypes that relate to treatment outcomes. Methods: We focused on the mental state examination (MSE) in the patients’ discharge summaries as the key part of the psychiatric records. We prepared a sample of 150 text documents that we manually annotated for psychiatric attributes and symptoms. These documents were further divided into training and test sets. We designed and implemented a system to detect the psychiatric attributes automatically and linked the pathologically assessed attributes to AMDP terminology. This workflow uses a pre-trained neural network model, which is fine-tuned on the training set, and validated on the independent test set. Furthermore, a traditional NLP and rule-based component linked the recognized mentions to AMDP terminology. In a further step, we applied the system on a larger clinical dataset of 510 patients to extract their symptoms. Results: The system identified the psychiatric attributes as well as their assessment (normal and pathological) and linked these entities to the AMDP terminology with an F1-score of 86% and 91% on an independent test set, respectively. Conclusion: The development of the current text mining system and the results highlight the feasibility of text mining methods applied to MSE in electronic mental health care reports.

Deciphering the Diversity of Mental Models in Neurodevelopmental Disorders: Knowledge Graph Representation of Public Data Using Natural Language Processing,"Kaur, M.; Costello, J.; Willis, E.; Kelm, K.; Reformat, M.Z.; Bolduc, F.V.","Background: Understanding how individuals think about a topic, known as the mental model, can significantly improve communication, especially in the medical domain where emotions and implications are high. Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) represent a group of diagnoses, affecting up to 18% of the global population, involving differences in the development of cognitive or social functions. In this study, we focus on 2 NDDs, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which involve multiple symptoms and interventions requiring interactions between 2 important stakeholders: parents and health professionals. There is a gap in our understanding of differences between mental models for each stakeholder, making communication between stakeholders more difficult than it could be. Objective: We aim to build knowledge graphs (KGs) from web-based information relevant to each stakeholder as proxies of mental models. These KGs will accelerate the identification of shared and divergent concerns between stakeholders. The developed KGs can help improve knowledge mobilization, communication, and care for individuals with ADHD and ASD. Methods: We created 2 data sets by collecting the posts from web-based forums and PubMed abstracts related to ADHD and ASD. We utilized the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) to detect biomedical concepts and applied Positive Pointwise Mutual Information followed by truncated Singular Value Decomposition to obtain corpus-based concept embeddings for each data set. Each data set is represented as a KG using a property graph model. Semantic relatedness between concepts is calculated to rank the relation strength of concepts and stored in the KG as relation weights. UMLS disorder-relevant semantic types are used to provide additional categorical information about each concept's domain. Results: The developed KGs contain concepts from both data sets, with node sizes representing the co-occurrence frequency of concepts and edge sizes representing relevance between concepts. ADHD- and ASD-related concepts from different semantic types shows diverse areas of concerns and complex needs of the conditions. KG identifies converging and diverging concepts between health professionals literature (PubMed) and parental concerns (web-based forums), which may correspond to the differences between mental models for each stakeholder. Conclusions: We show for the first time that generating KGs from web-based data can capture the complex needs of families dealing with ADHD or ASD. Moreover, we showed points of convergence between families and health professionals' KGs. Natural language processing-based KG provides access to a large sample size, which is often a limiting factor for traditional in-person mental model mapping. Our work offers a high throughput access to mental model maps, which could be used for further in-person validation, knowledge mobilization projects, and basis for communication about potential blind spots from stakeholders in interactions about NDDs. Future research will be needed to identify how concepts could interact together differently for each stakeholder. © 2022 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

BurnoutEnsemble: Augmented Intelligence to Detect Indications for Burnout in Clinical Psychology,"Merhbene, G.; Nath, S.; Puttick, A.R.; Kurpicz-Briki, M.","Burnout, a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged stress, is a growing concern. It is known to occur when an individual feels overwhelmed, emotionally exhausted, and unable to meet the constant demands imposed upon them. Detecting burnout is not an easy task, in large part because symptoms can overlap with those of other illnesses or syndromes. The use of natural language processing (NLP) methods has the potential to mitigate the limitations of typical burnout detection via inventories. In this article, the performance of NLP methods on anonymized free text data samples collected from the online forum/social media platform Reddit was analyzed. A dataset consisting of 13,568 samples describing first-hand experiences, of which 352 are related to burnout and 979 to depression, was compiled. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of NLP and machine learning methods in detecting indicators for burnout. Finally, it improves upon standard baseline classifiers by building and training an ensemble classifier using two methods (subreddit and random batching). The best ensemble models attain a balanced accuracy of 0.93, test F1 score of 0.43, and test recall of 0.93.

The Value of Extracting Clinician-Recorded Affect for Advancing Clinical Research on Depression: Proof-of-Concept Study Applying Natural Language Processing to Electronic Health Records,"Panaite, V.; Devendorf, A.R.; Finch, D.; Bouayad, L.; Luther, S.L.; Schultz, S.K.","Background: Affective characteristics are associated with depression severity, course, and prognosis. Patients’ affect captured by clinicians during sessions may provide a rich source of information that more naturally aligns with the depression course and patient-desired depression outcomes. Objective: In this paper, we propose an information extraction vocabulary used to pilot the feasibility and reliability of identifying clinician-recorded patient affective states in clinical notes from electronic health records. Methods: Affect and mood were annotated in 147 clinical notes of 109 patients by 2 independent coders across 3 pilots. Intercoder discrepancies were settled by a third coder. This reference annotation set was used to test a proof-of-concept natural language processing (NLP) system using a named entity recognition approach. Results: Concepts were frequently addressed in templated format and free text in clinical notes. Annotated data demonstrated that affective characteristics were identified in 87.8% (129/147) of the notes, while mood was identified in 97.3% (143/147) of the notes. The intercoder reliability was consistently good across the pilots (interannotator agreement [IAA] >70%). The final NLP system showed good reliability with the final reference annotation set (mood IAA=85.8%; affect IAA=80.9%).

DEPRESSION DETECTION ON REDDIT FORUM POSTS USING BERT & DEBERTA,"Kwee, H.R.; Zahra, A.","Depression is one of the mental disorders suffered by many people in the world. People usually keep it to themselves and do not seek treatment. Proper treatment is needed to prevent people from suicide. To know how people with depression behave, we can diagnose them from the language that they used every day. Because the Internet is one of the most used services in the world, we can learn from the text they posted on social media. In this work, we used Reddit posts as the main data source to learn about depressive text. We then finetuned BERT and DeBERTa models with the collected dataset. Using this method, the highest accuracy achieved is 96.76% using the BERT model. From our experimental results, BERT and DeBERTa are able to learn about depressive and non-depressive text. © 2022, ICIC International.",2022,,"ICIC Express Letters, Part B: Applications",13,9,983-989,,10.24507/icicelb.13.09.983,,#1465,Kwee 2022,"",""
A Comparative Study of Natural Language Processing Algorithms Based on Cities Changing Diabetes Vulnerability Data,"Wang, S.; Song, F.; Qiao, Q.; Liu, Y.; Chen, J.; Ma, J.","(1) Background: Poor adherence to management behaviors in Chinese Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients leads to an uncontrolled prognosis of diabetes, which results in significant economic costs for China. It is imperative to quickly locate vulnerability factors in the management behavior of patients with T2DM. (2) Methods: In this study, a thematic analysis of the collected interview materials was conducted to construct the themes of T2DM management vulnerability. We explored the applicability of the pre-trained models based on the evaluation metrics in text classification. (3) Results: We constructed 12 themes of vulnerability related to the health and well-being of people with T2DM in Tianjin. We considered that Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) performed better in this Natural Language Processing (NLP) task with a shorter completion time. With the splitting ratio of 6:3:1 and batch size of 64 for BERT, the test accuracy was 97.71%, the completion time was 10 min 24 s, and the macro-F1 score was 0.9752.

Using natural language processing to improve suicide classification requires consideration of race,"Rahman, N.; Mozer, R.; McHugh, R.K.; Rockett, I.R.H.; Chow, C.M.; Vaughan, G.","Objectives: To improve the accuracy of classification of deaths of undetermined intent and to examine racial differences in misclassification. Methods: We used natural language processing and statistical text analysis on restricted-access case narratives of suicides, homicides, and undetermined deaths in 37 states collected from the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) (2017). We fit separate race-specific classification models to predict suicide among undetermined cases using data from known homicide cases (true negatives) and known suicide cases (true positives). Results: A classifier trained on an all-race dataset predicts less than half of these cases as suicide. Importantly, our analysis yields an estimated suicide rate for the Black population comparable with the typical detection rate for the White population, indicating that misclassification excess is endemic for Black suicide. This problem may be mitigated by using race-specific data. Our findings, based on the statistical text analysis, also reveal systematic differences in the phrases identified as most predictive of suicide. Conclusions: This study highlights the need to understand the reasons underlying suicide rate differences and for further testing of strategies to reduce misclassification, particularly among people of color. © 2022 The American Association of Suicidology.",2022,,Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior,52,4,782-791,,10.1111/sltb.12862,,#1470,Rahman 2022,"",""
Online Discussions About Tinnitus: What Can We Learn From Natural Language Processing of Reddit Posts?,"Manchaiah, V.; Londero, A.; Deshpande, A.K.; Revel, M.; Palacios, G.; Boyd, R.L.; Ratinaud, P.","Background: This study was aimed at identifying key topics in online discussions about tinnitus by examining a large data set extracted from Reddit social media using a natural language processing technique. Method: A corpus of 113,215 posts about tinnitus was extracted from Reddit’s application programming interface. After cleaning the data for duplications and posts without any text information, the sample was reduced to 101,905 posts, which was subjected to cluster analysis using the open-source IRaMuTeQ software to identify main topics based on the co-occurrence of texts. These clusters were named by a panel of tinnitus experts (n = 9) by reading typical text segments within each cluster. Results: The cluster analysis identified 16 unique clusters that belong to two topics, which were named “tinnitus causes and consequences” and “tinnitus management and coping.” Based on their characteristics, the clusters were named: tinnitus timeline (10%), tinnitus perception (9.7%), medical triggers and modulators (8.8%), hearing research (8.8%), attention and silence (8.6%), social media posts about tinnitus (7.4%), hearing protection (7.3%), interaction with hearing health care providers (6.7%), mental health and coping (5.8%), music listening (5.7%), hope for a cure (5.6%), interactions with people without tinnitus (5.4%), dietary supplements and alternative therapies (3.2%), sleep (3.9%), dietary effects (1.7%), and writing about tinnitus and being thankful to online community (1.4%). Conclusions: Despite some limitations, tinnitus posts on Reddit provide rich real-world data to identify various issues and complaints that tinnitus patients and their significant others discuss in online communities. Some of the clusters identified here are novel (e.g., tinnitus timeline, interactions with people without tinnitus) and have not been much discussed in the tinnitus literature.

Anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation in people with serious mental illness in the general hospital setting,"Farran, D.; Bean, D.; Wang, T.; Msosa, Y.; Casetta, C.; Dobson, R.; Teo, J.T.; Scott, P.; Gaughran, F.","Objective: People with serious mental illnesses (SMI) have an increased risk of stroke compared to the general population. This study aims to evaluate oral anticoagulation prescription trends in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients with and without a comorbid SMI. Methods: An open-source retrieval system for clinical data (CogStack) was used to identify a cohort of AF patients with SMI who ever had an inpatient admission to King's College Hospital from 2011 to 2020. A Natural Language Processing pipeline was used to calculate CHA2DS2-VASc and HASBLED risk scores from Electronic Health Records free text. Antithrombotic prescriptions of warfarin and Direct acting oral anti-coagulants (DOACs) (apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, edoxaban) were extracted from discharge summaries. Results: Among patients included in the study (n = 16 916), 2.7% had a recorded co-morbid SMI diagnosis. Compared to non-SMI patients, those with SMI had significantly higher CHA2DS2-VASc (mean (SD): 5.3 (1.96) vs 4.7 (2.08), p < 0.001) and HASBLED scores (mean (SD): 3.2 (1.27) vs 2.5 (1.29), p < 0.001). Among AF patients having a CHA2DS2-VASc ≥2, those with co-morbid SMI were less likely than non-SMI patients to be prescribed an OAC (44% vs 54%, p < 0.001). However, there was no evidence of a significant difference between the two groups since 2019. Conclusion: Over recent years, DOAC prescription rates have increased among AF patients with SMI in acute hospitals. More research is needed to confirm whether the introduction of DOACs has reduced OAC treatment gaps in people with serious mental illness and to assess whether the use of DOACs has improved health outcomes in this population. © 2022",2022,,Journal of Psychiatric Research,153,,167-173,,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.06.044,,#1473,Farran 2022,"",""
Explainable Identification of Dementia From Transcripts Using Transformer Networks,"Ilias, L.; Askounis, D.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the main cause of dementia which is accompanied by loss of memory and may lead to severe consequences in peoples' everyday life if not diagnosed on time. Very few works have exploited transformer-based networks and despite the high accuracy achieved, little work has been done in terms of model interpretability. In addition, although Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) scores are inextricably linked with the identification of dementia, research works face the task of dementia identification and the task of the prediction of MMSE scores as two separate tasks. In order to address these limitations, we employ several transformer-based models, with BERT achieving the highest accuracy accounting for 87.50%. Concurrently, we propose an interpretable method to detect AD patients based on siamese networks reaching accuracy up to 83.75%. Next, we introduce two multi-task learning models, where the main task refers to the identification of dementia (binary classification), while the auxiliary one corresponds to the identification of the severity of dementia (multiclass classification). Our model obtains accuracy equal to 86.25% on the detection of AD patients in the multi-task learning setting. Finally, we present some new methods to identify the linguistic patterns used by AD patients and non-AD ones, including text statistics, vocabulary uniqueness, word usage, correlations via a detailed linguistic analysis, and explainability techniques (LIME). Findings indicate significant differences in language between AD and non-AD patients.  © 2013 IEEE.",2022,,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,26,8,4153-4164,,10.1109/JBHI.2022.3172479,,#1475,Ilias 2022,"",""
Analysis of a national response to a White House directive for ending veteran suicide,"Kalvesmaki, A.F.; Chapman, A.B.; Peterson, K.S.; Pugh, M.J.; Jones, M.; Gleason, T.C.","Objective: Analyze responses to a national request for information (RFI) to uncover gaps in policy, practice, and understanding of veteran suicide to inform federal research strategy. Data source: An RFI with 21 open-ended questions generated from Presidential Executive Order #1386, administered nationally from July 3 to August 5, 2019. Study design: Semi-structured, open-ended responses analyzed using a collaborative qualitative and text-mining data process. Data extraction methods: We aligned traditional qualitative methods with natural language processing (NLP) text-mining techniques to analyze 9040 open-ended question responses from 722 respondents to provide results within 3 months. Narrative inquiry and the medical explanatory model guided the data extraction and analytic process. Results: Five major themes were identified: risk factors, risk assessment, prevention and intervention, barriers to care, and data/research. Individuals and organizations mentioned different concepts within the same themes. In responses about risk factors, individuals frequently mentioned generic terms like “illness” while organizations mentioned specific terms like “traumatic brain injury.” Organizations and individuals described unique barriers to care and emphasized ways to integrate data and research to improve points of care. Organizations often identified lack of funding as barriers while individuals often identified key moments for prevention such as military transitions and ensuring care providers have military cultural understanding. Conclusions: This study provides an example of a rapid, adaptive analysis of a large body of qualitative, public response data about veteran suicide to support a federal strategy for an important public health topic. Combining qualitative and text-mining methods allowed a representation of voices and perspectives including the lived experiences of individuals who described stories of military transition, treatments that worked or did not, and the perspective of organizations treating veterans for suicide.

Prevalence of Sensitive Terms in Clinical Notes Using Natural Language Processing Techniques: Observational Study,"Lee, J.; Yang, S.; Holland-Hall, C.; Sezgin, E.; Gill, M.; Linwood, S.; Huang, Y.; Hoffman, J.","Background: With the increased sharing of electronic health information as required by the US 21st Century Cures Act, there is an increased risk of breaching patient, parent, or guardian confidentiality. The prevalence of sensitive terms in clinical notes is not known. Objective: The aim of this study is to define sensitive terms that represent the documentation of content that may be private and determine the prevalence and characteristics of provider notes that contain sensitive terms. Methods: Using keyword expansion, we defined a list of 781 sensitive terms. We searched all provider history and physical, progress, consult, and discharge summary notes for patients aged 0-21 years written between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2019, for a direct string match of sensitive terms. We calculated the prevalence of notes with sensitive terms and characterized clinical encounters and patient characteristics. Results: Sensitive terms were present in notes from every clinical context in all pediatric ages. Terms related to the mental health category were most used overall (254,975/1,338,297, 19.5%), but terms related to substance abuse and reproductive health were most common in patients aged 0-3 years. History and physical notes (19,854/34,771, 57.1%) and ambulatory progress notes (265,302/563,273, 47.1%) were most likely to include sensitive terms. The highest prevalence of notes with sensitive terms was found in pain management (950/1112, 85.4%) and child abuse (1092/1282, 85.2%) clinics. Conclusions: Notes containing sensitive terms are not limited to adolescent patients, specific note types, or certain specialties.

Homophobic and Hate Speech Detection Using Multilingual-BERT Model on Turkish Social Media,"Karayiğit, H.; Akdagli, A.; Aci, Ç.İ.","Homophobic expressions are a form of insulting the sexual orientation or personality of people. Severe psychological traumas may occur in people who are exposed to this type of communication. It is important to develop automatic classification systems based on language models to examine social media content and distinguish homophobic discourse. This study aims to present a pre-trained Multilingual Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (M-BERT) model that can successfully detect whether Turkish comments on social media contain homophobic or related hate comments (i.e., sexist, severe humiliation, and defecation expressions). Comments in the Homophobic-Abusive Turkish Comments (HATC) dataset were collected from Instagram to train the detection models. The HATC dataset was manually labeled at the sentence level and combined with the Abusive Turkish Comments (ATC) dataset that has developed in our previous study. The HATC dataset has been balanced using the resampling method and two forms of the dataset (i.e., resHATC and original HATC) were used in the experiments. Afterward, the M-BERT model was compared with DL-based models (i.e., Long-Short Term Memory, Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit), Traditional Machine Learning (TML) classifiers (i.e., Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Random Forest) and Ensemble Classifiers (i.e., Adaptive Boosting, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Gradient Boosting) for the best model selection. The performance of the detection models was evaluated using F1-score, precision, and recall performance metrics. Results showed the best performance (homophobic F1-score: 82.64%, hateful F1-score: 91.75%, neutral F1-score: 96.08%, average F1-score: 90.15%) were achieved with the M-BERT model on the HATC dataset. The M-BERT detection model can increase the effectiveness of filters in detecting Turkish homophobic and related hate speech in social networks. It can be used to detect homophobic and related hate speech for different languages since the M-BERT model has multilingual pre-trained data. © 2022, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

Catatonia Psychopathology and Phenomenology in a Large Dataset,"Dawkins, E.; Cruden-Smith, L.; Carter, B.; Amad, A.; Zandi, M.S.; Lewis, G.; David, A.S.; Rogers, J.P.","Background: The external clinical manifestations (psychopathology) and internal subjective experience (phenomenology) of catatonia are of clinical importance but have received little attention. This study aimed to use a large dataset to describe the clinical signs of catatonia; to assess whether these signs are associated with underlying diagnosis and prognosis; and to describe the phenomenology of catatonia, particularly with reference to fear. Methods: A retrospective descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted using the electronic healthcare records of a large secondary mental health trust in London, United Kingdom. Patients with catatonia were identified in a previous study by screening records using natural language processing followed by manual validation. The presence of items of the Bush-Francis Catatonia Screening Instrument was coded by the investigators. The presence of psychomotor alternation was assessed by examining the frequency of stupor and excitement in the same episode. A cluster analysis and principal component analysis were conducted on catatonic signs. Principal components were tested for their associations with demographic and clinical variables. Where text was available on the phenomenology of catatonia, this was coded by two authors in an iterative process to develop a classification of the subjective experience of catatonia. Results: Searching healthcare records provided 1,456 validated diagnoses of catatonia across a wide range of demographic groups, diagnoses and treatment settings. The median number of catatonic signs was 3 (IQR 2–5) and the most commonly reported signs were mutism, immobility/stupor and withdrawal. Stupor was present in 925 patients, of whom 105 (11.4%) also exhibited excitement. Out of 196 patients with excitement, 105 (53.6%) also had immobility/stupor. Cluster analysis produced two clusters consisting of negative and positive clinical features. From principal component analysis, three components were derived, which may be termed parakinetic, hypokinetic and withdrawal. The parakinetic component was associated with women, neurodevelopmental disorders and longer admission duration; the hypokinetic component was associated with catatonia relapse; the withdrawal component was associated with men and mood disorders. 68 patients had phenomenological data, including 49 contemporaneous and 24 retrospective accounts. 35% of these expressed fear, but a majority (72%) gave a meaningful narrative explanation for the catatonia, which consisted of hallucinations, delusions of several different types and apparently non-psychotic rationales. Conclusion: The clinical signs of catatonia can be considered as parakinetic, hypokinetic and withdrawal components. These components are associated with diagnostic and prognostic variables. Fear appears in a large minority of patients with catatonia, but narrative explanations are varied and possibly more common.

Prediction of Future Health Care Utilization Through Note-extracted Psychosocial Factors,"Dorr, D.A.; Quiñones, A.R.; King, T.; Wei, M.Y.; White, K.; Bejan, C.A.","Background: Persons with multimorbidity (≥2 chronic conditions) face an increased risk of poor health outcomes, especially as they age. Psychosocial factors such as social isolation, chronic stress, housing insecurity, and financial insecurity have been shown to exacerbate these outcomes, but are not routinely assessed during the clinical encounter. Our objective was to extract these concepts from chart notes using natural language processing and predict their impact on health care utilization for patients with multimorbidity. Methods: A cohort study to predict the 1-year likelihood of hospitalizations and emergency department visits for patients 65+ with multimorbidity with and without psychosocial factors. Psychosocial factors were extracted from narrative notes; all other covariates were extracted from electronic health record data from a large academic medical center using validated algorithms and concept sets. Logistic regression was performed to predict the likelihood of hospitalization and emergency department visit in the next year. Results: In all, 76,479 patients were eligible; the majority were White (89%), 54% were female, with mean age 73. Those with psychosocial factors were older, had higher baseline utilization, and more chronic illnesses. The 4 psychosocial factors all independently predicted future utilization (odds ratio=1.27-2.77, C-statistic=0.63). Accounting for demographics, specific conditions, and previous utilization, 3 of 4 of the extracted factors remained predictive (odds ratio=1.13-1.86) for future utilization. Compared with models with no psychosocial factors, they had improved discrimination. Individual predictions were mixed, with social isolation predicting depression and morbidity; stress predicting atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease onset; and housing insecurity predicting substance use disorder morbidity. Discussion: Psychosocial factors are known to have adverse health impacts, but are rarely measured; using natural language processing, we extracted factors that identified a higher risk segment of older adults with multimorbidity. Combining these extraction techniques with other measures of social determinants may help catalyze population health efforts to address psychosocial factors to mitigate their health impacts. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

DISCO PAL: Diachronic Spanish sonnet corpus with psychological and affective labels,"Barbado, A.; Fresno, V.; Riesco, Á.M.; Ros, S.","Nowadays, there are many applications of text mining over corpora from different languages. However, most of them are based on texts in prose, lacking applications that work with poetry texts. An example of an application of text mining in poetry is the usage of features derived from their individual words in order to capture the lexical, sublexical and interlexical meaning, and infer the General Affective Meaning (GAM) of the text. However, even though this proposal has been proved as useful for poetry in some languages, there is a lack of studies for both Spanish poetry and for highly-structured poetic compositions such as sonnets. This article presents a study over an annotated corpus of Spanish sonnets, in order to analyse if it is possible to build features from their individual words for predicting their GAM. The purpose of this is to model sonnets at an affective level. The article also analyses the relationship between the GAM of the sonnets and the content itself. For this, we consider the content from a psychological perspective, identifying with tags when a sonnet is related to a specific term. Then, we study how GAM changes according to each of those psychological terms. The corpus used contains 274 Spanish sonnets from authors of different centuries, from fifteenth to nineteenth. This corpus was annotated by different domain experts. The experts annotated the poems with affective and lexico-semantic features, as well as with domain concepts that belong to psychology. Thanks to this, the corpus of sonnets can be used in different applications, such as poetry recommender systems, personality text mining studies of the authors, or the usage of poetry for therapeutic purposes. © 2021, The Author(s).",2022,,Language Resources and Evaluation,56,2,501-542,,10.1007/s10579-021-09557-1,,#1486,Barbado 2022,"",""
Leveraging Tweets for Artificial Intelligence Driven Sentiment Analysis on the COVID‐19 Pandemic,"Alkhaldi, N.A.; Asiri, Y.; Mashraqi, A.M.; Halawani, H.T.; Abdel‐khalek, S.; Mansour, R.F.","The COVID‐19 pandemic has been a disastrous event that has elevated several psychological issues such as depression given abrupt social changes and lack of employment. At the same time, social scientists and psychologists have gained significant interest in understanding the way people express emotions and sentiments at the time of pandemics. During the rise in COVID‐19 cases with stricter lockdowns, people expressed their sentiments on social media. This offers a deep understanding of human psychology during catastrophic events. By exploiting user‐generated content on social media such as Twitter, people’s thoughts and sentiments can be examined, which aids in introducing health intervention policies and awareness campaigns. The recent developments of natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning (DL) models have exposed noteworthy performance in sentiment analysis. With this in mind, this paper presents a new sunflower optimization with deep‐learning‐driven sentiment analysis and classification (SFODLD‐SAC) on COVID‐19 tweets. The presented SFODLD‐SAC model focuses on the identification of people’s sentiments during the COVID‐19 pandemic. To accomplish this, the SFODLD‐SAC model initially preprocesses the tweets in distinct ways such as stemming, removal of stopwords, usernames, link punctuations, and numerals. In addition, the TF‐IDF model is applied for the useful extraction of features from the preprocessed data. Moreover, the cascaded recurrent neural network (CRNN) model is employed to analyze and classify sentiments. Finally, the SFO algorithm is utilized to optimally adjust the hyperparameters involved in the CRNN model.

Applying the Health Belief Model to Characterize Racial/Ethnic Differences in Digital Conversations Related to Depression Pre- And Mid-COVID-19: Descriptive Analysis,"Castilla-Puentes, R.; Pesa, J.; Brethenoux, C.; Furey, P.; Valletta, L.G.; Falcone, T.","Background: The prevalence of depression in the United States is >3 times higher mid-COVID-19 versus prepandemic. Racial/ethnic differences in mindsets around depression and the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic are not well characterized. Objective: This study aims to describe attitudes, mindsets, key drivers, and barriers related to depression pre- and mid-COVID-19 by race/ethnicity using digital conversations about depression mapped to health belief model (HBM) concepts. Methods: Advanced search, data extraction, and artificial intelligence–powered tools were used to harvest, mine, and structure open-source digital conversations of US adults who engaged in conversations about depression pre- (February 1, 2019-February 29, 2020) and mid-COVID-19 pandemic (March 1, 2020-November 1, 2020) across the internet. Natural language processing, text analytics, and social data mining were used to categorize conversations that included a self-identifier into racial/ethnic groups. Conversations were mapped to HBM concepts (ie, perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, cues to action, and self-efficacy). Results are descriptive in nature. Results: Of 2.9 and 1.3 million relevant digital conversations pre- and mid-COVID-19, race/ethnicity was determined among 1.8 million (62.2%) and 979,000 (75.3%) conversations, respectively. Pre-COVID-19, 1.3 million (72.1%) conversations about depression were analyzed among non-Hispanic Whites (NHW), 227,200 (12.6%) among Black Americans (BA), 189,200 (10.5%) among Hispanics, and 86,800 (4.8%) among Asian Americans (AS). Mid-COVID-19, a total of 736,100 (75.2%) conversations about depression were analyzed among NHW, 131,800 (13.5%) among BA, 78,300 (8.0%) among Hispanics, and 32,800 (3.3%) among AS. Conversations among all racial/ethnic groups had a negative tone, which increased pre- to mid-COVID-19; finding support from others was seen as a benefit among most groups. Hispanics had the highest rate of any racial/ethnic group of conversations showing an avoiding mindset toward their depression. Conversations related to external barriers to seeking treatment (eg, stigma, lack of support, and lack of resources) were generally more prevalent among Hispanics, BA, and AS than among NHW. Being able to benefit others and building a support system were key drivers to seeking help or treatment for all racial/ethnic groups. Conclusions: There were considerable racial/ethnic differences in drivers and barriers to seeking help and treatment for depression pre- and mid-COVID-19. As expected, COVID-19 has made conversations about depression more negative and with frequent discussions of barriers to seeking care. Applying concepts of the HBM to data on digital conversation about depression allowed organization of the most frequent themes by race/ethnicity. Individuals of all groups came online to discuss their depression. These data highlight opportunities for culturally competent and targeted approaches to addressing areas amenable to change that might impact the ability of people to ask for or receive mental health help, such as the constructs that comprise the HBM. ©Ruby Castilla-Puentes, Jacqueline Pesa, Caroline Brethenoux, Patrick Furey, Liliana Gil Valletta, Tatiana Falcone.",2022,,JMIR Formative Research,6,6,,,10.2196/33637,,#1489,Castilla-Puentes 2022,"",""
Natural language model for automatic identification of Intimate Partner Violence reports from Twitter,"Al-Garadi, M.A.; Kim, S.; Guo, Y.; Warren, E.; Yang, Y.-C.; Lakamana, S.; Sarker, A.","Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a preventable public health problem that affects millions of people worldwide. Approximately one in four women are estimated to be or have been victims of severe violence at some point in their lives, irrespective of age, ethnicity, and economic status. Victims often report IPV experiences on social media, and automatic detection of such reports via machine learning may enable improved surveillance and targeted distribution of support and/or interventions for those in need. However, no artificial intelligence systems for automatic detection currently exists, and we attempted to address this research gap. We collected posts from Twitter using a list of IPV-related keywords, manually reviewed subsets of retrieved posts, and prepared annotation guidelines to categorize tweets into IPV-report or non-IPV-report. We annotated 6,348 tweets in total, with the inter-annotator agreement (IAA) of 0.86 (Cohen's kappa) among 1,834 double-annotated tweets. The class distribution in the annotated dataset was highly imbalanced, with only 668 posts (∼11%) labeled as IPV-report. We then developed an effective natural language processing model to identify IPV-reporting tweets automatically. The developed model achieved classification F1-scores of 0.76 for the IPV-report class and 0.97 for the non-IPV-report class. We conducted post-classification analyses to determine the causes of system errors and to ensure that the system did not exhibit biases in its decision making, particularly with respect to race and gender. Our automatic model can be an essential component for a proactive social media-based intervention and support framework, while also aiding population-level surveillance and large-scale cohort studies. © 2022 The Authors",2022,,Array,15,,,,10.1016/j.array.2022.100217,,#1490,Al-Garadi 2022,"",""
Detecting Potentially Harmful and Protective Suicide-Related Content on Twitter: Machine Learning Approach,"Metzler, H.; Baginski, H.; Niederkrotenthaler, T.; Garcia, D.","Background: Research has repeatedly shown that exposure to suicide-related news media content is associated with suicide rates, with some content characteristics likely having harmful and others potentially protective effects. Although good evidence exists for a few selected characteristics, systematic and large-scale investigations are lacking. Moreover, the growing importance of social media, particularly among young adults, calls for studies on the effects of the content posted on these platforms. Objective: This study applies natural language processing and machine learning methods to classify large quantities of social media data according to characteristics identified as potentially harmful or beneficial in media effects research on suicide and prevention. Methods: We manually labeled 3202 English tweets using a novel annotation scheme that classifies suicide-related tweets into 12 categories. Based on these categories, we trained a benchmark of machine learning models for a multiclass and a binary classification task. As models, we included a majority classifier, an approach based on word frequency (term frequency-inverse document frequency with a linear support vector machine) and 2 state-of-the-art deep learning models (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers [BERT] and XLNet). The first task classified posts into 6 main content categories, which are particularly relevant for suicide prevention based on previous evidence. These included personal stories of either suicidal ideation and attempts or coping and recovery, calls for action intending to spread either problem awareness or prevention-related information, reporting of suicide cases, and other tweets irrelevant to these 5 categories. The second classification task was binary and separated posts in the 11 categories referring to actual suicide from posts in the off-topic category, which use suicide-related terms in another meaning or context. Results: In both tasks, the performance of the 2 deep learning models was very similar and better than that of the majority or the word frequency classifier. BERT and XLNet reached accuracy scores above 73% on average across the 6 main categories in the test set and F1-scores between 0.69 and 0.85 for all but the suicidal ideation and attempts category (F1=0.55). In the binary classification task, they correctly labeled around 88% of the tweets as about suicide versus off-topic, with BERT achieving F1-scores of 0.93 and 0.74, respectively. These classification performances were similar to human performance in most cases and were comparable with state-of-the-art models on similar tasks. Conclusions: The achieved performance scores highlight machine learning as a useful tool for media effects research on suicide. The clear advantage of BERT and XLNet suggests that there is crucial information about meaning in the context of words beyond mere word frequencies in tweets about suicide. By making data labeling more efficient, this work has enabled large-scale investigations on harmful and protective associations of social media content with suicide rates and help-seeking behavior. © 2022 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Association between depressive symptoms and cognitive-behavioural therapy receipt within a psychosis sample: a cross-sectional study,"Mason, A.; Irving, J.; Pritchard, M.; Sanyal, J.; Colling, C.; Chandran, D.; Stewart, R.","OBJECTIVES: To examine whether depressive symptoms predict receipt of cognitive-behavioural therapy for psychosis (CBTp) in individuals with psychosis. DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional analysis of electronic health records (EHRs) of a clinical cohort. SETTING: A secondary National Health Service mental healthcare service serving four boroughs of south London, UK. PARTICIPANTS: 20 078 patients diagnosed with an International Classification of Diseases, version 10 (ICD-10) code between F20 and 29 extracted from an EHR database. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary: Whether recorded depressive symptoms predicted CBTp session receipt, defined as at least one session of CBTp identified from structured EHR fields supplemented by a natural language processing algorithm. Secondary: Whether age, gender, ethnicity, symptom profiles (positive, negative, manic and disorganisation symptoms), a comorbid diagnosis of depression, anxiety or bipolar disorder, general CBT receipt prior to the primary psychosis diagnosis date or type of psychosis diagnosis predicted CBTp receipt. RESULTS: Of patients with a psychotic disorder, only 8.2% received CBTp. Individuals with at least one depressive symptom recorded, depression symptom severity and 12 out of 15 of the individual depressive symptoms independently predicted CBTp receipt. Female gender, White ethnicity and presence of a comorbid affective disorder or primary schizoaffective diagnosis were independently positively associated with CBTp receipt within the whole sample and the top 25% of mentioned depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with a psychotic disorder who had recorded depressive symptoms were significantly more likely to receive CBTp sessions, aligning with CBTp guidelines of managing depressive symptoms related to a psychotic experience. However, overall receipt of CBTp is low and more common in certain demographic groups, and needs to be increased. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022. Re-use permitted under CC BY.

"Investigating the relationship between thought interference, somatic passivity and outcomes in patients with psychosis: a natural language processing approach using a clinical records search platform in south London","Magrangeas, T.T.; Kolliakou, A.; Sanyal, J.; Patel, R.; Stewart, R.","Objectives We aimed to apply natural language processing algorithms in routine healthcare records to identify reported somatic passivity (external control of sensations, actions and impulses) and thought interference symptoms (thought broadcasting, insertion, withdrawal), first-rank symptoms traditionally central to diagnosing schizophrenia, and determine associations with prognosis by analysing routine outcomes. Design Four algorithms were developed on deidentified mental healthcare data and applied to ascertain recorded symptoms over the 3 months following first presentation to a mental healthcare provider in a cohort of patients with a primary schizophreniform disorder (ICD-10 F20-F29) diagnosis. Setting and participants From the electronic health records of a large secondary mental healthcare provider in south London, 9323 patients were ascertained from 2007 to the data extraction date (25 February 2020). Outcomes The primary binary dependent variable for logistic regression analyses was any negative outcome (Mental Health Act section, >2 antipsychotics prescribed, >22 days spent in crisis care) over the subsequent 2 years. Results Final adjusted models indicated significant associations of this composite outcome with baseline somatic passivity (prevalence 4.9%; adjusted OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.88), thought insertion (10.7%; 1.24, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.55) and thought withdrawal (4.9%; 1.36, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.69), but not independently with thought broadcast (10.3%; 1.05, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.22). Conclusions Symptoms traditionally central to the diagnosis of schizophrenia, but under-represented in current diagnostic frameworks, were thus identified as important predictors of short-term to medium-term prognosis in schizophreniform disorders.  © 2022 Authors.",2022,,BMJ Open,12,8,,,10.1136/bmjopen-2021-057433,,#1497,Magrangeas 2022,"",""
Popular and Scientific Discourse on Autism: Representational Cross-Cultural Analysis of Epistemic Communities to Inform Policy and Practice,"Gauld, C.; Maquet, J.; Micoulaud-Franchi, J.-A.; Dumas, G.","Background: Social media provide a window onto the circulation of ideas in everyday folk psychiatry, revealing the themes and issues discussed both by the public and by various scientific communities. Objective: This study explores the trends in health information about autism spectrum disorder within popular and scientific communities through the systematic semantic exploration of big data gathered from Twitter and PubMed. Methods: First, we performed a natural language processing by text-mining analysis and with unsupervised (machine learning) topic modeling on a sample of the last 10,000 tweets in English posted with the term #autism (January 2021). We built a network of words to visualize the main dimensions representing these data. Second, we performed precisely the same analysis with all the articles using the term “autism” in PubMed without time restriction. Lastly, we compared the results of the 2 databases. Results: We retrieved 121,556 terms related to autism in 10,000 tweets and 5.7x109 terms in 57,121 biomedical scientific articles. The 4 main dimensions extracted from Twitter were as follows: integration and social support, understanding and mental health, child welfare, and daily challenges and difficulties. The 4 main dimensions extracted from PubMed were as follows: diagnostic and skills, research challenges, clinical and therapeutical challenges, and neuropsychology and behavior. Conclusions: This study provides the first systematic and rigorous comparison between 2 corpora of interests, in terms of lay representations and scientific research, regarding the significant increase in information available on autism spectrum disorder and of the difficulty to connect fragments of knowledge from the general population. The results suggest a clear distinction between the focus of topics used in the social media and that of scientific communities. This distinction highlights the importance of knowledge mobilization and exchange to better align research priorities with personal concerns and to address dimensions of well-being, adaptation, and resilience. Health care professionals and researchers can use these dimensions as a framework in their consultations to engage in discussions on issues that matter to beneficiaries and develop clinical approaches and research policies in line with these interests. Finally, our study can inform policy makers on the health and social needs and concerns of individuals with autism and their caregivers, especially to define health indicators based on important issues for beneficiaries. ©Christophe Gauld, Julien Maquet, Jean-Arthur Micoulaud-Franchi, Guillaume Dumas.",2022,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,24,6,,,10.2196/32912,,#1498,Gauld 2022,"",""

NeuroBlu enables users to perform statistical analysis through a secure web-based interface. Structured data are available for sociodemographic characteristics, mental health service contacts, hospital admissions, International Classification of Diseases ICD-9/ICD-10 diagnosis, prescribed medications, family history of mental disorders, Clinical Global Impression - Severity and Improvement (CGI-S/CGI-I) and Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF). To further enhance the data set, natural language processing (NLP) tools have been applied to obtain mental state examination (MSE) and social/environmental data. This paper describes the development and implementation of NeuroBlu, the procedures to safeguard data integrity and security and how the data set supports the generation of real-world evidence (RWE) in mental health. Participants As of 31 July 2021, 562 940 individuals (48.9% men) were present in the data set with a mean age of 33.4 years (SD: 18.4 years). The most frequently recorded diagnoses were substance use disorders (1 52 790 patients), major depressive disorder (1 29 120 patients) and anxiety disorders (1 03 923 patients). The median duration of follow-up was 7 months (IQR: 1.3 to 24.4 months). Findings to date The data set has supported epidemiological studies demonstrating increased risk of psychiatric hospitalisation and reduced antidepressant treatment effectiveness among people with comorbid substance use disorders. It has also been used to develop data visualisation tools to support clinical decision-making, evaluate comparative effectiveness of medications, derive models to predict treatment response and develop NLP applications to obtain clinical information from unstructured EHR data. Future plans The NeuroBlu data set will be further analysed to better understand factors related to poor clinical outcome, treatment responsiveness and the development of predictive analytic tools that may be incorporated into the source EHR system to support real-time clinical decision-making in the delivery of mental healthcare services.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.",2022,,BMJ Open,12,4,,,10.1136/bmjopen-2021-057227,,#1499,Patel 2022,"",""

An accurate natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to identify high-risk injuries in electronic health record notes could improve detection and awareness of abuse. The objectives were to: 1) develop an NLP algorithm that accurately identifies injuries in infants associated with abuse and 2) determine the accuracy of this algorithm. Methods: An NLP algorithm was designed to identify ten specific injuries known to be associated with physical abuse in infants. Iterative cycles of review identified inaccurate triggers, and coding of the algorithm was adjusted. The optimized NLP algorithm was applied to emergency department (ED) providers’ notes on 1344 consecutive sample of infants seen in 9 EDs over 3.5 months. Results were compared with review of the same notes conducted by a trained reviewer blind to the NLP results with discrepancies adjudicated by a child abuse expert. Results: Among the 1344 encounters, 41 (3.1%) had one of the high-risk injuries. The NLP algorithm had a sensitivity and specificity of 92.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 79.0%–98.1%) and 98.1% (95% CI: 97.1%–98.7%), respectively, and positive and negative predictive values were 60.3% and 99.8%, respectively, for identifying high-risk injuries.

Detecting Presence of PTSD Using Sentiment Analysis From Text Data,"Sawalha, J.; Yousefnezhad, M.; Shah, Z.; Brown, M.R.G.; Greenshaw, A.J.; Greiner, R.","Rates of Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have risen significantly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Telehealth has emerged as a means to monitor symptoms for such disorders. This is partly due to isolation or inaccessibility of therapeutic intervention caused from the pandemic. Additional screening tools may be needed to augment identification and diagnosis of PTSD through a virtual medium. Sentiment analysis refers to the use of natural language processing (NLP) to extract emotional content from text information. In our study, we train a machine learning (ML) model on text data, which is part of the Audio/Visual Emotion Challenge and Workshop (AVEC-19) corpus, to identify individuals with PTSD using sentiment analysis from semi-structured interviews. Our sample size included 188 individuals without PTSD, and 87 with PTSD. The interview was conducted by an artificial character (Ellie) over a video-conference call. Our model was able to achieve a balanced accuracy of 80.4% on a held out dataset used from the AVEC-19 challenge. Additionally, we implemented various partitioning techniques to determine if our model was generalizable enough. This shows that learned models can use sentiment analysis of speech to identify the presence of PTSD, even through a virtual medium. This can serve as an important, accessible and inexpensive tool to detect mental health abnormalities during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Depression and Suicide Analysis Using Machine Learning and NLP,"Jain, P.; Srinivas, K.R.; Vichare, A.","Depression is a common type of mental illness that can impair performance and lead to suicide ideation or attempts. Traditional techniques used by mental health experts can assist in determining an individual's type of depression. Machine learning and NLP were used to understand how to predict posts that indicate depression in people and their accuracy. For this work, we have used a dataset from reddit. Reddit is an ideal destination to use as a supplement to the traditional public health system because of its punctuality in exchanging ideas, versatility in presenting emotions, as well as compatibility to use medical terms. We examined the comments and posts about suicidal ideation. We used NLP to gain a better understanding of interdisciplinary fields which are related to suicide. We discovered two help groups for depression and suicidal thoughts: r/depression and r/SuicideWatch. The famous “SuicideWatch” subreddit is commonly used by people who have thoughts of suicide and gives significant signals for suicidal behavior. A brief scan through the articles discloses that the subreddits are legitimate online spots to seek assistance and provide honest text data about people's mental state. We have used multiple ML algorithms such as Naïve Bayes, SVM. To address the research problem, we have considered two subreddits that provided us with appropriate information to track people at risk.

A machine learning approach to alcohol screening could accelerate best practices when integrated into electronic health record (EHR) systems. This study aimed to validate externally a natural language processing (NLP) classifier developed at an independent medical center. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: The site for validation was a midwestern United States tertiary-care, urban medical center that has an inpatient structured universal screening model for unhealthy substance use and an active addiction consult service. Participants/Cases: Unplanned admissions of adult patients between October 23, 2017 and December 31, 2019, with EHR documentation of manual alcohol screening were included in the cohort (n = 57 605). Measurements: The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) served as the reference standard. AUDIT scores ≥5 for females and ≥8 for males served as cases for UAU. To examine error in manual screening or under-reporting, a post hoc error analysis was conducted, reviewing discordance between the NLP classifier and AUDIT-derived reference. All clinical notes excluding the manual screening and AUDIT documentation from the EHR were included in the NLP analysis. Findings: Using clinical notes from the first 24 hours of each encounter, the NLP classifier demonstrated an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCROC) and precision-recall area under the curve (PRAUC) of 0.91 (95% CI = 0.89–0.92) and 0.56 (95% CI = 0.53–0.60), respectively.

Public opinion about the UK government during COVID-19 and implications for public health: A topic modeling analysis of open-ended survey response data,"Wright, L.; Burton, A.; McKinlay, A.; Steptoe, A.; Fancourt, D.","Background Confidence in the central UK Government has declined since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, and while this may be linked to specific government actions to curb the spread of the virus, understanding is still incomplete. Examining public opinion is important, as research suggests that low confidence in government increases the extent of non-compliance with infection-dampening rules (for instance, social distancing); however, the detailed reasons for this association are still unclear. Methods To understand public opinion on the central UK government during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, we used structural topic modeling, a text mining technique, to extract themes from over 4000 free-text survey responses, collected between 14 October and 26 November 2020. Results We identified eleven topics, among which were topics related to perceived government corruption and cronyism, complaints about inconsistency in rules and messaging, lack of clear planning, and lack of openness and transparency. Participants reported that elements of the government’s approach had made it difficult to comply with guidelines (e.g., changing rules) or were having impacts on mental wellbeing (e.g., inability to plan for the future). Conclusions Results suggested that consistent, transparent communication and messaging from the government is critical to improving compliance with measures to contain the virus, as well as protecting mental health during health emergencies.

Psychological Well-Being of Left-Behind Children in China: Text Mining of the Social Media Website Zhihu,"Lyu, Y.; Chow, J.C.-C.; Hwang, J.-J.; Li, Z.; Ren, C.; Xie, J.","China’s migrant population has significantly contributed to its economic growth; however, the impact on the well-being of left-behind children (LBC) has become a serious public health problem. Text mining is an effective tool for identifying people’s mental state, and is therefore beneficial in exploring the psychological mindset of LBC. Traditional data collection methods, which use questionnaires and standardized scales, are limited by their sample sizes. In this study, we created a computational application to quantitively collect personal narrative texts posted by LBC on Zhihu, which is a Chinese question-and-answer online community website; 1475 personal narrative texts posted by LBC were gathered. We used four types of words, i.e., first-person singular pronouns, negative words, past tense verbs, and death-related words, all of which have been associated with depression and suicidal ideations in the Chinese Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (CLIWC) dictionary. We conducted vocabulary statistics on the personal narrative texts of LBC, and bilateral t-tests, with a control group, to analyze the psychological well-being of LBC. The results showed that the proportion of words related to depression and suicidal ideations in the texts of LBC was significantly higher than in the control group. The differences, with respect to the four word types (i.e., first-person singular pronouns, negative words, past tense verbs, and death-related words), were 5.37, 2.99, 2.65, and 2.00 times, respectively, suggesting that LBC are at a higher risk of depression and suicide than their counterparts. By sorting the texts of LBC, this research also found that child neglect is a main contributing factor to psychological difficulties of LBC. Furthermore, mental health problems and the risk of suicide in vulnerable groups, such as LBC, is a global public health issue, as well as an important research topic in the era of digital public health. Through a linguistic analysis, the results of this study confirmed that the experiences of left-behind children negatively impact their mental health. The present findings suggest that it is vital for the public and nonprofit sectors to establish online suicide prevention and intervention systems to improve the well-being of LBC through digital technology. © 2022 by the authors.

Mental Health Intent Recognition for Arabic-Speaking Patients Using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and BERT Model,"Mezzi, R.; Yahyaoui, A.; Krir, M.W.; Boulila, W.; Koubaa, A.","For many years, mental health has been hidden behind a veil of shame and prejudice. In 2017, studies claimed that 10.7% of the global population suffered from mental health disorders. Recently, people started seeking relaxing treatment through technology, which enhanced and ex-panded mental health care, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, where the use of mental health forums, websites, and applications has increased by 95%. However, these solutions still have many limits, as existing mental health technologies are not meant for everyone. In this work, an up-to-date literature review on state-of-the-art of mental health and healthcare solutions is provided. Then, we focus on Arab-speaking patients and propose an intelligent tool for mental health intent recognition. The proposed system uses the concepts of intent recognition to make mental health diagnoses based on a bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) model and the International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Experiments are conducted using a dataset collected at the Military Hospital of Tunis in Tunisia. Results show excellent performance of the proposed system (the accuracy is over 92%, the precision, recall, and F1 scores are over 94%) in mental health patient diagnosis for five aspects (depression, suicidality, panic disorder, social phobia, and adjustment disorder). In addition, the tool was tested and evaluated by medical staff at the Military Hospital of Tunis, who found it very interesting to help decision-making and prioritizing patient appointment scheduling, especially with a high number of treated patients every day. © 2022 by the authors.

Mapping multimorbidity in individuals with schizophrenia and bipolar disorders: Evidence from the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust Biomedical Research Centre (SLAM BRC) case register,"Bendayan, R.; Kraljevic, Z.; Shaari, S.; Das-Munshi, J.; Leipold, L.; Chaturvedi, J.; Mirza, L.; Aldelemi, S.; Searle, T.; Chance, N.; Mascio, A.; Skiada, N.; Wang, T.; Roberts, A.; Stewart, R.; Bean, D.; Dobson, R.","Objectives The first aim of this study was to design and develop a valid and replicable strategy to extract physical health conditions from clinical notes which are common in mental health services. Then, we examined the prevalence of these conditions in individuals with severe mental illness (SMI) and compared their individual and combined prevalence in individuals with bipolar (BD) and schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD). Design Observational study. Setting Secondary mental healthcare services from South London Participants Our maximal sample comprised 17 500 individuals aged 15 years or older who had received a primary or secondary SMI diagnosis (International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition, F20-31) between 2007 and 2018. Measures We designed and implemented a data extraction strategy for 21 common physical comorbidities using a natural language processing pipeline, MedCAT. Associations were investigated with sex, age at SMI diagnosis, ethnicity and social deprivation for the whole cohort and the BD and SSD subgroups. Linear regression models were used to examine associations with disability measured by the Health of Nations Outcome Scale. Results Physical health data were extracted, achieving precision rates (F1) above 0.90 for all conditions. The 10 most prevalent conditions were diabetes, hypertension, asthma, arthritis, epilepsy, cerebrovascular accident, eczema, migraine, ischaemic heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The most prevalent combination in this population included diabetes, hypertension and asthma, regardless of their SMI diagnoses. Conclusions Our data extraction strategy was found to be adequate to extract physical health data from clinical notes, which is essential for future multimorbidity research using text records. We found that around 40% of our cohort had multimorbidity from which 20% had complex multimorbidity (two or more physical conditions besides SMI). Sex, age, ethnicity and social deprivation were found to be key to understand their heterogeneity and their differential contribution to disability levels in this population.

Emotionally charged text classification with deep learning and sentiment semantic,"Huan, J.L.; Sekh, A.A.; Quek, C.; Prasad, D.K.","Text classification is one of the widely used phenomena in different natural language processing tasks. State-of-the-art text classifiers use the vector space model for extracting features. Recent progress in deep models, recurrent neural networks those preserve the positional relationship among words achieve a higher accuracy. To push text classification accuracy even higher, multi-dimensional document representation, such as vector sequences or matrices combined with document sentiment, should be explored. In this paper, we show that documents can be represented as a sequence of vectors carrying semantic meaning and classified using a recurrent neural network that recognizes long-range relationships. We show that in this representation, additional sentiment vectors can be easily attached as a fully connected layer to the word vectors to further improve classification accuracy. On the UCI sentiment labelled dataset, using the sequence of vectors alone achieved an accuracy of 85.6%, which is better than 80.7% from ridge regression classifier—the best among the classical technique we tested. Additional sentiment information further increases accuracy to 86.3%.

Hints of Independence in a Pre-scripted World: On Controlled Usage of Open-domain Language Models for Chatbots in Highly Sensitive Domains,"Başar, E.; Hendrickx, I.; Krahmer, E.; de Bruijn, G.-J.; Bosse, T.","Open-domain large language models have progressed to generating natural-sounding and coherent text. Even though the generated texts appear human-like, the main stumbling block is that their output is never fully predictable, which runs the risk of resulting in harmful content such as false statements or inflammatory language. This makes it difficult to apply these models in highly sensitive domains including personal health counselling. Hence, most of the chatbots for highly sensitive domains are developed using pre-scripted approaches. Although pre-scripted approaches are highly controlled, they suffer from repetitiveness and scalability issues. In this paper, we explore the possibility of combining the best of both worlds. We propose and describe in detail a new, flexible expert-driven hybrid architecture for harnessing the benefits of large language models in a controlled manner for highly sensitive domains and discuss the expectations and challenges. © 2022 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Here, we present the first validation study using secondary care mental health data with linkage to UKB from Oxford - Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) focusing on comparison of demographic information, diagnostic outcome, medication record and cognitive test results, with missing data and the implied bias from both resources depicted. We applied a natural language processing model to extract information embedded in unstructured text from clinical notes and attachments. Using a contingency table we compared the demographic information recorded in UKB and CRIS.

Self-reported medication records in UKB had general PPV of 47.0%, with the prevalence of frequently prescribed medicines to each typical mental health disorder considerably different from the information provided by CRIS. UKB is highly multimodal, but with limited follow-up records, whereas CRIS offers a longitudinal high-resolution clinical picture with more than ten years of observations.

Multimodal Deep Learning Models for Detecting Dementia From Speech and Transcripts,"Ilias, L.; Askounis, D.","Alzheimer's dementia (AD) entails negative psychological, social, and economic consequences not only for the patients but also for their families, relatives, and society in general. Despite the significance of this phenomenon and the importance for an early diagnosis, there are still limitations. Specifically, the main limitation is pertinent to the way the modalities of speech and transcripts are combined in a single neural network. Existing research works add/concatenate the image and text representations, employ majority voting approaches or average the predictions after training many textual and speech models separately. To address these limitations, in this article we present some new methods to detect AD patients and predict the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores in an end-to-end trainable manner consisting of a combination of BERT, Vision Transformer, Co-Attention, Multimodal Shifting Gate, and a variant of the self-attention mechanism. Specifically, we convert audio to Log-Mel spectrograms, their delta, and delta-delta (acceleration values). First, we pass each transcript and image through a BERT model and Vision Transformer, respectively, adding a co-attention layer at the top, which generates image and word attention simultaneously. Secondly, we propose an architecture, which integrates multimodal information to a BERT model via a Multimodal Shifting Gate. Finally, we introduce an approach to capture both the inter- and intra-modal interactions by concatenating the textual and visual representations and utilizing a self-attention mechanism, which includes a gate model. Experiments conducted on the ADReSS Challenge dataset indicate that our introduced models demonstrate valuable advantages over existing research initiatives achieving competitive results in both the AD classification and MMSE regression task. Specifically, our best performing model attains an accuracy of 90.00% and a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 3.61 in the AD classification task and MMSE regression task, respectively, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance in the MMSE regression task.

Surveillance of Domestic Violence Using Text Mining Outputs From Australian Police Records,"Karystianis, G.; Adily, A.; Schofield, P.W.; Wand, H.; Lukmanjaya, W.; Buchan, I.; Nenadic, G.; Butler, T.","In Australia, domestic violence reports are mostly based on data from the police, courts, hospitals, and ad hoc surveys. However, gaps exist in reporting information such as victim injuries, mental health status and abuse types. The police record details of domestic violence events as structured information (e.g., gender, postcode, ethnicity), but also in text narratives describing other details such as injuries, substance use, and mental health status. However, the voluminous nature of the narratives has prevented their use for surveillance purposes. We used a validated text mining methodology on 492,393 police-attended domestic violence event narratives from 2005 to 2016 to extract mental health mentions on persons of interest (POIs) (individuals suspected/charged with a domestic violence offense) and victims, abuse types, and victim injuries. A significant increase was observed in events that recorded an injury type (28.3% in 2005 to 35.6% in 2016). The pattern of injury and abuse types differed between male and female victims with male victims more likely to be punched and to experience cuts and bleeding and female victims more likely to be grabbed and pushed and have bruises. The four most common mental illnesses (alcohol abuse, bipolar disorder, depression schizophrenia) were the same in male and female POIs. An increase from 5.0% in 2005 to 24.3% in 2016 was observed in the proportion of events with a reported mental illness with an increase between 2005 and 2016 in depression among female victims. These findings demonstrate that extracting information from police narratives can provide novel insights into domestic violence patterns including confounding factors (e.g., mental illness) and thus enable policy responses to address this significant public health problem.

Can natural language processing models extract and classify instances of interpersonal violence in mental healthcare electronic records: An applied evaluative study,"Botelle, R.; Bhavsar, V.; Kadra-Scalzo, G.; Mascio, A.; Williams, M.V.; Roberts, A.; Velupillai, S.; Stewart, R.","Objective This paper evaluates the application of a natural language processing (NLP) model for extracting clinical text referring to interpersonal violence using electronic health records (EHRs) from a large mental healthcare provider. Design A multidisciplinary team iteratively developed guidelines for annotating clinical text referring to violence. Keywords were used to generate a dataset which was annotated (ie, classified as affirmed, negated or irrelevant) for: presence of violence, patient status (ie, as perpetrator, witness and/or victim of violence) and violence type (domestic, physical and/or sexual). An NLP approach using a pretrained transformer model, BioBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining) was fine-tuned on the annotated dataset and evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation. Setting We used the Clinical Records Interactive Search (CRIS) database, comprising over 500 000 de-identified EHRs of patients within the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, a specialist mental healthcare provider serving an urban catchment area. Participants Searches of CRIS were carried out based on 17 predefined keywords. Randomly selected text fragments were taken from the results for each keyword, amounting to 3771 text fragments from the records of 2832 patients. Outcome measures We estimated precision, recall and F1 score for each NLP model. We examined sociodemographic and clinical variables in patients giving rise to the text data, and frequencies for each annotated violence characteristic. Results Binary classification models were developed for six labels (violence presence, perpetrator, victim, domestic, physical and sexual).

eHealth Engagement on Facebook during COVID-19: Simplistic Computational Data Analysis,"Hermann, C.; Govender, M.","Understanding social media networks and group interactions is crucial to the advancement of linguistic and cultural behavior. This includes how people accessed advice on health during COVID-19 lockdown. Some people turned to social media to access information on health when other routes were curtailed by isolation rules, particularly among older generations. Facebook public pages, groups and verified profiles using keywords “senior citizen health”, “older generations”, and “healthy living” were analyzed over a 12-month period to examine engagement with social media promoting good mental health. CrowdTangle was used to source status updates, photo and video sharing information in the English language, which resulted in an initial 116,321 posts and 6,462,065 interactions. Data analysis and visualization were used to explore large datasets, including natural language processing for “message” content discovery, word frequency and correlational analysis as well as co-word clustering.

Improving Web-Based Treatment Intake for Multiple Mental and Substance Use Disorders by Text Mining and Machine Learning: Algorithm Development and Validation,"Wiegersma, S.; Hidajat, M.; Schrieken, B.; Veldkamp, B.; Olff, M.","Background: Text mining and machine learning are increasingly used in mental health care practice and research, potentially saving time and effort in the diagnosis and monitoring of patients. Previous studies showed that mental disorders can be detected based on text, but they focused on screening for a single predefined disorder instead of multiple disorders simultaneously. Objective: The aim of this study is to develop a Dutch multi-class text-classification model to screen for a range of mental disorders to refer new patients to the most suitable treatment. Methods: On the basis of textual responses of patients (N=5863) to a questionnaire currently used for intake and referral, a 7-class classifier was developed to distinguish among anxiety, panic, posttraumatic stress, mood, eating, substance use, and somatic symptom disorders. A linear support vector machine was fitted using nested cross-validation grid search. Results: The highest classification rate was found for eating disorders (82%). The scores for panic (55%), posttraumatic stress (52%), mood (50%), somatic symptom (50%), anxiety (35%), and substance use disorders (33%) were lower, likely because of overlapping symptoms. The overall classification accuracy (49%) was reasonable for a 7-class classifier. Conclusions: A classification model was developed that could screen text for multiple mental health disorders. The screener resulted in an additional outcome score that may serve as input for a formal diagnostic interview and referral. This may lead to a more efficient and standardized intake process. ©Sytske Wiegersma, Maurice Hidajat, Bart Schrieken, Bernard Veldkamp, Miranda Olff.

A Multitask Learning Framework for Abuse Detection and Emotion Classification,"Huang, Y.; Song, R.; Giunchiglia, F.; Xu, H.","The rapid development of online social media makes abuse detection a hot topic in the field of emotional computing. However, most natural language processing (NLP) methods only focus on linguistic features of posts and ignore the influence of users’ emotions. To tackle the problem, we propose a multitask framework combining abuse detection and emotion classification (MFAE) to expand the representation capability of the algorithm on the basis of the existing pretrained language model. Specifically, we use bidirectional encoder representation from transformers (BERT) as the encoder to generate sentence representation. Then, we used two different decoders for emotion classification and abuse detection, respectively. To further strengthen the influence of the emotion classification task on abuse detection, we propose a cross-attention (CA) component in the decoder, which further improves the learning effect of our multitask learning framework. Experimental results on five public datasets show that our method is superior to other state-of-the-art methods. © 2022 by the authors.

Hierarchical Weighted Framework for Emotional Distress Detection using Personalized Affective Cues,"Jadhay, N.N.; Sugandhi, R.","Emotional distress detection has become a hot topic of research in recent years due to concerns related to mental health and complex nature distress identification. One of the challenging tasks is to use non-invasive technology to understand and detect emotional distress in humans. Personalized affective cues provide a non-invasive approach considering visual, vocal, and verbal cues to recognize the affective state. In this paper, we are proposing a multimodal hierarchical weighted framework to recognize emotional distress. We are utilizing negative emotions to detect the unapparent behavior of the person. To capture facial cues, we have employed hybrid models consisting of a transfer learned residual network and CNN models. Extracted facial cue features are processed and fused at decision using a weighted approach. For audio cues, we employed two different models exploiting the LSTM and CNN capabilities fusing the results at the decision level. For textual cues, we used a BERT transformer to learn extracted features. We have proposed a novel decision level adaptive hierarchical weighted algorithm to fuse the results of the different modalities. The proposed algorithm has been used to detect the emotional distress of a person. Hence, we have proposed a novel algorithm for the detection of emotional distress based on visual, verbal, and vocal cues. Experiments on multiple datasets like FER2013, JAFFE, CK+, RAVDESS, TESS, ISEAR, Emotion Stimulus dataset, and Daily-Dialog dataset demonstrates the effectiveness and usability of the proposed architecture.

Detection of self-harm and suicidal ideation in emergency department triage notes,"Rozova, V.; Witt, K.; Robinson, J.; Li, Y.; Verspoor, K.","Objective: Accurate identification of self-harm presentations to Emergency Departments (ED) can lead to more timely mental health support, aid in understanding the burden of suicidal intent in a population, and support impact evaluation of public health initiatives related to suicide prevention. Given lack of manual self-harm reporting in ED, we aim to develop an automated system for the detection of self-harm presentations directly from ED triage notes. Materials and methods: We frame this as supervised classification using natural language processing (NLP), utilizing a large data set of 477 627 free-text triage notes from ED presentations in 2012-2018 to The Royal Melbourne Hospital, Australia. The data were highly imbalanced, with only 1.4% of triage notes relating to self-harm. We explored various preprocessing techniques, including spelling correction, negation detection, bigram replacement, and clinical concept recognition, and several machine learning methods. Results: Our results show that machine learning methods dramatically outperform keyword-based methods. We achieved the best results with a calibrated Gradient Boosting model, showing 90% Precision and 90% Recall (PR-AUC 0.87) on blind test data. Prospective validation of the model achieves similar results (88% Precision; 89% Recall). Discussion: ED notes are noisy texts, and simple token-based models work best. Negation detection and concept recognition did not change the results while bigram replacement significantly impaired model performance. Conclusion: This first NLP-based classifier for self-harm in ED notes has practical value for identifying patients who would benefit from mental health follow-up in ED, and for supporting surveillance of self-harm and suicide prevention efforts in the population. © 2021 The Author(s).",2022,,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association,29,3,472-480,,10.1093/jamia/ocab261,,#1556,Rozova 2022,"",""
Information Extraction Framework for Disability Determination Using a Mental Functioning Use-Case,"Zirikly, A.; Desmet, B.; Newman-Griffis, D.; Marfeo, E.E.; McDonough, C.; Goldman, H.; Chan, L.","Natural language processing (NLP) in health care enables transformation of complex narrative information into high value products such as clinical decision support and adverse event monitoring in real time via the electronic health record (EHR). However, information technologies for mental health have consistently lagged because of the complexity of measuring and modeling mental health and illness. The use of NLP to support management of mental health conditions is a viable topic that has not been explored in depth. This paper provides a framework for the advanced application of NLP methods to identify, extract, and organize information on mental health and functioning to inform the decision-making process applied to assessing mental health. We present a use-case related to work disability, guided by the disability determination process of the US Social Security Administration (SSA). From this perspective, the following questions must be addressed about each problem that leads to a disability benefits claim: When did the problem occur and how long has it existed? How severe is it? Does it affect the person's ability to work? and What is the source of the evidence about the problem? Our framework includes 4 dimensions of medical information that are central to assessing disability-temporal sequence and duration, severity, context, and information source. We describe key aspects of each dimension and promising approaches for application in mental functioning. For example, to address temporality, a complete functional timeline must be created with all relevant aspects of functioning such as intermittence, persistence, and recurrence. Severity of mental health symptoms can be successfully identified and extracted on a 4-level ordinal scale from absent to severe. Some NLP work has been reported on the extraction of context for specific cases of wheelchair use in clinical settings. We discuss the links between the task of information source assessment and work on source attribution, coreference resolution, event extraction, and rule-based methods. Gaps were identified in NLP applications that directly applied to the framework and in existing relevant annotated data sets. We highlighted NLP methods with the potential for advanced application in the field of mental functioning. Findings of this work will inform the development of instruments for supporting SSA adjudicators in their disability determination process. The 4 dimensions of medical information may have relevance for a broad array of individuals and organizations responsible for assessing mental health function and ability. Further, our framework with 4 specific dimensions presents significant opportunity for the application of NLP in the realm of mental health and functioning beyond the SSA setting, and it may support the development of robust tools and methods for decision-making related to clinical care, program implementation, and other outcomes. © 2022 JMIR Publications Inc..

Public Attention and Sentiment toward Intimate Partner Violence Based on Weibo in China: A Text Mining Approach,"Xu, H.; Zeng, J.; Tai, Z.; Hao, H.","The mobile internet has resulted in intimate partner violence (IPV) events not being viewed as interpersonal and private issues. Such events become public events in the social network environment. IPV has become a public health issue of widespread concern. It is a challenge to obtain systematic and detailed data using questionnaires and interviews in traditional Chinese culture, because of face-saving and the victim’s shame factors. However, online comments about specific IPV events on social media provide rich data in understanding the public’s attitudes and emotions towards IPV. By applying text mining and sentiment analysis to the field of IPV, this study involved construction of a Chinese IPV sentiment dictionary and a complete research framework. We analyzed the trends of the Chinese public’s emotional evolution concerning IPV events from the perspectives of a time series as well as geographic space and social media. The results show that the anonymity of social networks and the guiding role of opinion leaders result in traditional cultural factors such as face-saving and family shame for IPV events being no longer applicable, leading to the spiral of an anti-silence effect. Meanwhile, in the process of public emotional communication, anger often overwhelms reason, and the spiral of silence remains in effect in social media. In addition, there are offensive words used in the IPV event texts that indicate misogyny in emotional, sexual, economic and psychological abuse. Fortunately, mainstream media, as crucial opinion leaders in the social network, can have a positive role in guiding public opinion, improving people’s ability to judge the validity of network information, and formulating people’s rational behaviour. © 2022 by the authors.

Results: In March–April 2020, the themes focused on the use of telehealth in general, telehealth for mental health applications, and Medicare covering telehealth services. In March–April 2021, the themes focused on news events regarding telehealth and the rise in prominence of telehealth services. The network analysis shows a shift in the distribution of telehealth information among influential accounts and reveals that the network became more connected, with a change in the control of information spread.

The voice data were set to 4 seconds in length and the number of mel filters was set to 128 in the preprocessing process. For text data, we used the subject text data of the interview and derived the embedding vector using a transformers tokenizer. Based on each data set, the BERT-CNN and CNN-BiLSTM proposed in this paper were applied and combined to classify depression.

Research on Chinese Consumers’ Attitudes Analysis of Big-Data Driven Price Discrimination Based on Machine Learning,"Wang, J.; Shu, T.; Zhao, W.; Zhou, J.","From the end of 2018 in China, the Big-data Driven Price Discrimination (BDPD) of online consumption raised public debate on social media. To study the consumers’ attitude about the BDPD, this study constructed a semantic recognition frame to deconstruct the Affection-Behavior-Cognition (ABC) consumer attitude theory using machine learning models inclusive of the Labeled Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Snow Natural Language Processing (NLP), based on social media comments text dataset. Similar to the questionnaires published results, this article verified that 61% of consumers expressed negative sentiment toward BDPD in general. Differently, on a finer scale, this study further measured the negative sentiments that differ significantly among different topics. The measurement results show that the topics “Regular Customers Priced High” (69%) and “Usage Intention” (67%) occupy the top two places of negative sentiment among consumers, and the topic “Precision Marketing” (42%) is at the bottom. Moreover, semantic recognition results that 49% of consumers’ comments involve multiple topics, indicating that consumers have a pretty clear cognition of the complex status of the BDPD. Importantly, this study found some topics that had not been focused on in previous studies, such as more than 8% of consumers calling for government and legal departments to regulate BDPD behavior, which indicates that quite enough consumers are losing confidence in the self-discipline of the platform enterprises. Another interesting result is that consumers who pursue solutions to the BDPD belong to two mutually exclusive groups: government protection and self-protection. The significance of this study is that it reminds the e-commerce platforms to pay attention to the potential harm for consumers’ psychology while bringing additional profits through the BDPD. Otherwise, the negative consumer attitudes may cause damage to brand image, business reputation, and the sustainable development of the platforms themselves. It also provides the government supervision departments an advanced analysis method reference for more effective administration to protect social fairness.

"Domestic Violence in Residential Care Facilities in New South Wales, Australia: A Text Mining Study","Withall, A.; Karystianis, G.; Duncan, D.; Hwang, Y.I.; Kidane, A.H.; Butler, T.","Background and Objectives: The police are often the first to attend domestic violence events in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, recording related details as structured information (e.g., date of the event, type of incident, premises type) and text narratives which contain important information (e.g., mental health status, abuse types) for victims and perpetrators. This study examined the characteristics of victims and persons of interest (POIs) suspected and/or charged with perpetrating a domestic violence-related crime in residential care facilities. Research Design and Methods: The study employed a text mining method that extracted key information from 700 police-recorded domestic violence events in NSW residential care facilities. Results: Victims were mostly female (65.4%) and older adults (median age 80.3). POIs were predominantly male (67.0%) and were younger than the victims (median age 57.0). While low rates of mental illnesses were recorded (29.1% in victims; 17.4% in POIs), ""dementia""was the most common condition among POIs (55.7%) and victims (73.0%). ""Physical abuse""was the most common abuse type (80.2%) with ""bruising""the most common injury (36.8%). The most common relationship between perpetrator and victim was ""carer""(76.6%). Discussion and Implications: These findings highlight the opportunity provided by police text-based data to offer insights into elder abuse within residential care facilities. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

Boamente: A Natural Language Processing-Based Digital Phenotyping Tool for Smart Monitoring of Suicidal Ideation,"Diniz, E.J.S.; Fontenele, J.E.; de Oliveira, A.C.; Bastos, V.H.; Teixeira, S.; Rabêlo, R.L.; Calçada, D.B.; Dos Santos, R.M.; de Oliveira, A.K.; Teles, A.S.","People at risk of suicide tend to be isolated and cannot share their thoughts. For this reason, suicidal ideation monitoring becomes a hard task. Therefore, people at risk of suicide need to be monitored in a manner capable of identifying if and when they have a suicidal ideation, enabling professionals to perform timely interventions. This study aimed to develop the Boamente tool, a solution that collects textual data from users’ smartphones and identifies the existence of suicidal ideation. The solution has a virtual keyboard mobile application that passively collects user texts and sends them to a web platform to be processed. The platform classifies texts using natural language processing and a deep learning model to recognize suicidal ideation, and the results are presented to mental health professionals in dashboards. Text classification for sentiment analysis was implemented with different machine/deep learning algorithms. A validation study was conducted to identify the model with the best performance results. The BERTimbau Large model performed better, reaching a recall of 0.953 (accuracy: 0.955; precision: 0.961; F-score: 0.954; AUC: 0.954).

Global evidence of expressed sentiment alterations during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Wang, J.; Fan, Y.; Palacios, J.; Chai, Y.; Guetta-Jeanrenaud, N.; Obradovich, N.; Zhou, C.; Zheng, S.","The COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented burdens on people’s physical health and subjective well-being. While countries worldwide have developed platforms to track the evolution of COVID-19 infections and deaths, frequent global measurements of affective states to gauge the emotional impacts of pandemic and related policy interventions remain scarce. Using 654 million geotagged social media posts in over 100 countries, covering 74% of world population, coupled with state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques, we develop a global dataset of expressed sentiment indices to track national- and subnational-level affective states on a daily basis. We present two motivating applications using data from the first wave of COVID-19 (from 1 January to 31 May 2020). First, using regression discontinuity design, we provide consistent evidence that COVID-19 outbreaks caused steep declines in expressed sentiment globally, followed by asymmetric, slower recoveries. Second, applying synthetic control methods, we find moderate to no effects of lockdown policies on expressed sentiment, with large heterogeneity across countries.

Automatically identifying opioid use disorder in non-cancer patients on chronic opioid therapy,"Zhu, V.J.; Lenert, L.A.; Barth, K.S.; Simpson, K.N.; Li, H.; Kopscik, M.; Brady, K.T.","Background: Using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes alone to record opioid use disorder (OUD) may not completely document OUD in the electronic health record (EHR). We developed and evaluated natural language processing (NLP) approaches to identify OUD from the clinal note. We explored the concordance between ICD-coded and NLP-identified OUD. Methods: We studied EHRs from 13,654 (female: 8223; male: 5431) adult non-cancer patients who received chronic opioid therapy (COT) and had at least one clinical note between 2013 and 2018. Of eligible patients, we randomly selected 10,218 (75%) patients as the training set and the remaining 3436 patients (25%) as the test dataset for NLP approaches. Results: We generated 539 terms representing OUD mentions in clinical notes (e.g., “opioid use disorder,” “opioid abuse,” “opioid dependence,” “opioid overdose”) and 73 terms representing OUD medication treatments. By domain expert manual review for the test dataset, our NLP approach yielded high performance: 98.5% for precision, 100% for recall, and 99.2% for F-measure. The concordance of these NLP and ICD identified OUD was modest (Kappa = 0.63). Conclusions: Our NLP approach can accurately identify OUD patients from clinical notes. The combined use of ICD diagnostic code and NLP approach can improve OUD identification. © The Author(s) 2022.",2022,,Health Informatics Journal,28,2,,,10.1177/14604582221107808,,#1599,Zhu 2022,"",""
Text mining of Reddit posts: Using latent Dirichlet allocation to identify common parenting issues,"Westrupp, E.M.; Greenwood, C.J.; Fuller-Tyszkiewicz, M.; Berkowitz, T.S.; Hagg, L.; Youssef, G.","Parenting interventions offer an evidence-based method for the prevention and early intervention of child mental health problems, but to-date their population-level effectiveness has been limited by poor reach and engagement, particularly for fathers, working mothers, and disadvantaged families. Tailoring intervention content to parents' context offers the potential to enhance parent engagement and learning by increasing relevance of content to parents' daily experiences. However, this approach requires a detailed understanding of the common parenting situations and issues that parents face day-to-day, which is currently lacking. We sought to identify the most common parenting situations discussed by parents on parenting- specific forums of the free online discussion forum, Reddit. We aimed to understand perspectives from both mothers and fathers, and thus retrieved publicly available data from r/Daddit and r/Mommit. We used latent Dirichlet allocation to identify the 10 most common topics discussed in the Reddit posts, and completed a manual text analysis to summarize the parenting situations (defined as involving a parent and their child aged 0-18 years, and describing a potential/actual issue). We retrieved 340 (r/Daddit) and 578 (r/Mommit) original posts. A model with 31 latent Dirichlet allocation topics was best fitting, and 24 topics included posts that met our inclusion criteria for manual review. We identified 45 unique but broadly defined parenting situations. The majority of parenting situations were focused on basic childcare situations relating to eating, sleeping, routines, sickness, and toilet training; or related to how to respond to child negative emotions or difficult behavior. Most situations were discussed in relation to infant or toddler aged children, and there was high consistency in the themes raised in r/Daddit and r/Mommit. Our results offer potential to tailor parenting interventions in a meaningful way, creating opportunities to develop content and resources that are directly relevant to parents' lived experiences. © 2022 Westrupp et al.

"GAUGING STRESS, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION IN STUDENT DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Singh, A.; Kumar, D.","During the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic, studies came across the world concerning with health issues. Researches began to find the repercussions of the virus. The virus was found to be versatile as it changes its nature and targets the lungs of a person. Later, it was seen an astonishing massacre around the world due to the virus. Many people have lost their life but many more people are still suffering with bad psychological state. Researchers began to research on the nature virus but very few researches were made on the other side-effects of this pandemic. One such crucial subject to attend in contemporary world is the effect of COVID-19 on psychological state in general population. This side-effect may lead to raise an alarming situation in future that could result in more death cases. The proposed paper presents a study on the detection of stress and depression in people caused by the pandemic. The proposed methodology is based on perceived questionnaire method through which people’s responses are recorded in the form of text. COVID victims have been interrogated against a set of questions and their responses are recorded. The methodology performs text mining of their responses that also include the people’s reaction from social networking sites. The text processing of people’s responses is done by natural language processing (NLP). NLP is used to interpret textural facts into meaningful segments that must be understandable to machine. The refined data has been transformed into PSS (perceived stress scale) scaling factor that ranges from 0 to 4 showing various level of stress. The proposed system utilized artificial intelligence in which na’́ive Bayes classifier, K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Decision tree and Random forest algorithms are applied to predict the emotional state of a person.

The COVID-19 outbreak hugely contributed to this dramatic increase in the volume of published research. Currently, text mining of the volume of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 publications is limited to the first months of the outbreak. We aim to identify the major topics in COVID-19 literature collected from several citational sources and analyze the temporal trend from November 2019 to December 2021. Methods: We performed an extensive literature search on SARS-Cov-2 and COVID-19 publications on PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science (WoS) and a structural topic modelling on the retrieved abstracts. The temporal trend of the recognized topics was analyzed. Furthermore, a comparison between our corpus and the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) repository was performed. Results: We collected 269,186 publications and identified 10 topics. The most popular topic was related to the clinical pictures of the COVID-19 outbreak, which has a constant trend, and the least popular includes studies on COVID-19 literature and databases. “Telemedicine”, “Vaccine development”, and “Epidemiology” were popular topics in the early phase of the pandemic; increasing topics in the last period are “COVID-19 impact on mental health”, “Forecasting”, and “Molecular Biology”. “Education” was the second most popular topic, which emerged in September 2020. Conclusions: We identified 10 topics for classifying COVID-19 research publications and estimated a nonlinear temporal trend that gives an overview of their unfolding over time. Several citational databases must be searched to retrieve a complete set of studies despite the efforts to build repositories for COVID-19 literature.

With no universal definition available in research or practice, this study aimed to analyse six months of publicly available Reddit data to identify common characteristics and perceived causes of ON as reported in eating disorder- (ED) and diet-related subreddits. A Python code was used to extract comments from a publicly available Reddit data archive. To explore themes for each category of subreddit, a text-mining approach was combined with thematic analysis within a social constructionist framework. In both subreddit categories, the manifestation of ON was conceptualized in the context of shifting ED expressions and associated with the perception of food as a threat as well as the pursuit of superiority. In ED-subreddits, commenters discussed ON as a safety mechanism for health anxieties, the role of the body as visualising ON, and ON’s role within a proactive selfcare culture. Diet-related subreddit themes encompassed the conceptualization of ON as health perfectionism, ON’s underlying mental health concerns, and ON pathology as the result of problematic norms. The analysis of 246 online comments revealed a wide scope of ON conceptualizations and highlighted the need for a coherent diagnostic model of ON, which takes into account sociocultural as well as individual factors. © Author(s).",2022,,Cyberpsychology,16,5,,,10.5817/CP2022-5-6,,#1644,Opitz 2022,"",""

Identification of maternal depression risk from natural language collected in a mobile health app,"Krishnamurti, T.; Allen, K.; Hayani, L.; Rodriguez, S.; Davis, A.L.","Depression is one of the most common pregnancy complications, affecting approximately 15% of pregnant people. While valid psychometric measures of depression risk exist, they are not consistently administered at routine prenatal care, exacerbating the problem of adequate detection. The language we use in daily life offers a window into our psychological wellbeing. In this longitudinal observational cohort study of prenatal patients using a prenatal care mobile health app, we examine how features of app-entered natural language and other app-entered patient-reported data may be used as indicators for validated depression risk measures. Patient participants (n=1091) were prescribed a prenatal care app as part of a quality improvement initiative in the UPMC healthcare system from September 2019 - May 2022. Natural language from open-ended writing prompts in the app and self-reported daily mood, were entered by patients using the tool. Participants also completed a validated measure of depression risk - the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) - at least once in their pregnancy. A variety of natural language processing tools were used to score sentiment, categorize topics, and capture other semantic and syntactic information from text entries. LASSO was used to model the relationship between the natural language features and depression risk. Open-ended text within a 30-day and 60-day timeframe of completing an EPDS was found to be moderately predictive of moderate to severe depression risk (AUROC=0.66 and 0.67, for each respective timeframe). When combined with average daily reported mood, open-ended text showed good predictive power (AUROC=0.87).

Depression Classification From Tweets Using Small Deep Transfer Learning Language Models,"Rizwan, M.; Mushtaq, M.F.; Akram, U.; Mehmood, A.; Ashraf, I.; Sahelices, B.","Depression detection from social media texts such as Tweets or Facebook comments could be very beneficial as early detection of depression may even avoid extreme consequences of long-term depression i.e. suicide. In this study, depression intensity classification is performed using a labeled Twitter dataset. Further, this study makes a detailed performance evaluation of four transformer-based pre-trained small language models, particularly those having less than 15 million tunable parameters i.e. Electra Small Generator (ESG), Electra Small Discriminator (ESD), XtremeDistil-L6 (XDL) and Albert Base V2 (ABV) for classification of depression intensity using Tweets. The models are fine-tuned to get the best performance by applying different hyperparameters. The models are tested by classification of depression intensity of labeled tweets for three label classes i.e. 'severe', 'moderate', and 'mild' by downstream fine-tuning the parameters. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, F1, precision, recall, and specificity are calculated to evaluate the performance of the models. Comparative analysis of these models is also done with a moderately larger model i.e. DistilBert which has 67 million tunable parameters for the same task with the same experimental settings. Results indicate that ESG outperforms all other models including DistilBert due to its better deep contextualized text representation as it gets the best F1 score of 89% with comparatively less training time. Further optimization of ESG is also proposed to make it suitable for low-powered devices.

A Multimodal Approach for Dementia Detection from Spontaneous Speech with Tensor Fusion Layer,"Ilias, L.; Askounis, D.; Psarras, J.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder, meaning that the symptoms develop gradually throughout the years. It is also the main cause of dementia, which affects memory, thinking skills, and mental abilities. Nowadays, researchers have moved their interest towards AD detection from spontaneous speech, since it constitutes a time-effective procedure. However, existing state-of-the-art works proposing multimodal approaches do not take into consideration the inter- and intra-modal interactions and propose early and late fusion approaches. To tackle these limitations, we propose deep neural networks, which can be trained in an end-to-end trainable way and capture the inter- and intra-modal interactions. Firstly, each audio file is converted to an image consisting of three channels, i.e., log-Mel spectrogram, delta, and delta-delta. Next, each transcript is passed through a BERT model followed by a gated self-attention layer. Similarly, each image is passed through a Swin Transformer followed by an independent gated self-attention layer. Acoustic features are extracted also from each audio file. Finally, the representation vectors from the different modalities are fed to a tensor fusion layer for capturing the inter-modal interactions. Extensive experiments conducted on the ADReSS Challenge dataset indicate that our introduced approaches obtain valuable advantages over existing research initiatives reaching Accuracy and F1-score up to 86.25% and 85.48% respectively.  © 2022 IEEE.",2022,,"BHI-BSN 2022 - IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics and IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Wearable and Implantable Body Sensor Networks, Symposium Proceedings",,,,,10.1109/BHI56158.2022.9926818,,#1689,Ilias 2022,"",""

Nine machine and deep learning algorithms were implemented, most of them yielding results with a precision above 90%. In addition, the automatic detection of articles topics was also performed, through topic modeling with the top2vec model, which allowed concluding that the stigmatization of mental health occurs, essentially, in Economics and Politics related news. The results confirm the existence of stigma in Portuguese newspapers (52% of the 978 articles collected) and the effectiveness of the use of Artificial Intelligence models to detect it. Additionally, a set of 978 articles collected and manually classified with the classes [“stigmatizing”, “literal”] is obtained. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2022,,Communications in Computer and Information Science,1652 CCIS,,332-343,,10.1007/978-3-031-15743-1_31,,#1721,Yanchuk 2022,"",""
Online Evaluation Method of College Students' Mental Health Based on Campus Network Text Mining,"Chen, D.; Wen, K.; Ke, R.; Liu, J.","Aiming at the problem that the mental health of contemporary college students is affected by many parties, and the evaluation accuracy and evaluation effect are poor, an online evaluation method of college students' mental health based on campus network text mining is proposed. Mining and analyzing the association rules of the association features between texts, analyzing the monitoring quantitative index of the online evaluation of college students' mental health; based on the regional transfer coefficient of existing mental health text information, the influencing factors of college students' mental health are determined, and the online evaluation model of college students' mental health is constructed. The membership degree of the factors is comprehensively calculated, and the corresponding fuzzy consistent matrix is used to compare the quantitative results of the index scales, and the interval number judgment matrix is constructed, which corresponds to the interval number weight of each secondary evaluation index one-to-one. The weight of the indicators is divided into the mental health assessment level, and the online assessment of college students' mental health is completed. The experimental results show that the evaluation accuracy of the design method is more than 97.36%, the recall rate is more than 97%, and the highest packet loss rate is less than 0.3%, which proves that the online evaluation results of college students in this method are more accurate and that the accuracy and effect of the online evaluation of college students' mental health are improved.  © 2022 Dongrui Chen et al.",2022,,Mathematical Problems in Engineering,2022,,,,10.1155/2022/1526578,,#1727,Chen 2022,"",""
National Hospital Care Survey Demonstration Projects: Characteristics and Mortality Outcomes of Opioid-involved Hospital Encounters With Co-occurring Disorders,"Brown, A.M.; White, D.G.; Badwe, R.; Adams, N.; O’jiaku-Okorie, A.; Shaikh, S.; Adegboye, A.; Lee, J.; Jackson, G.; Defrances, C.","Objective—This report demonstrates the use of National Hospital Care Survey (NHCS) data to describe characteristics of patients experiencing opioid-involved hospital encounters with co-occurring disorders, defined as lifetime diagnoses of both a substance use disorder (SUD) and a selected mental health issue (MHI), that is, diagnosed at any point in the past or during the present encounter. Methods—Enhanced algorithms using searches of medical codes and natural language processing of clinical notes were applied to the 2016 NHCS data linked to the 2016–2017 National Death Index (NDI) and 2016–2017 Drug-Involved Mortality (DIM) data. Opioid-involved emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations for patients with co-occurring disorders were analyzed to describe specific types of SUDs, MHIs, and opioids or opioid antagonists taken. Comparisons between patients with and without co-occurring disorders were also examined by patient characteristics and several hospital outcomes, including discharge status, repeat ED visits, and mortality. The data are unweighted and not nationally representative. Results—In the 2016 NHCS, 7.8% of opioid-involved ED visits and 15.0% of opioid-involved hospitalizations were among patients with co-occurring disorders. Tobacco use disorder and opioid use disorder were the most common SUDs, and anxiety and depressive disorders were the most common MHIs. Differences in age, discharge status, and the number of opioid-involved encounters were observed between patients with and without co-occurring disorders. A greater percentage of patients with co-occurring disorders died either at the hospital or within 1 year after discharge from any cause, as well as from a drug overdose. Conclusion—Although these data are not nationally representative, the 2016 NHCS data linked to the 2016–2017 NDI data and 2016–2017 DIM data provide insight into hospital use and mortality outcomes of patients experiencing opioid-involved encounters with co-occurring disorders. © 2022, National Center for Health Statistics.

Comparison of Machine Learning Models for Early Depression Detection from Users’ Posts,"Mothe, J.; Ramiandrisoa, F.; Ullah, M.Z.","With around 300 millions people worldwide suffering from depression, the detection of this disorder is crucial and a challenge for individual and public health. As with many diseases, early detection means better medical management; the use of social media messages as potential clues to depression is an opportunity to assist in this early detection by automatic means. This chapter is based on the participation of the CNRS IRIT laboratory in the early detection of depressive people (eRisk) task at the CLEF evaluation forum. Early depression detection differs from depression detection in that it considers temporality; the system must make its decision about a user’s possible depression with as little data as possible. In this chapter we re-evaluate the models we have developed for our participation at eRisk over the years on the different collections, to obtain a more robust comparison. We also add new models. We use well-established classification methods, such as Logistic regression, Random forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The users’ data from which the system should detect if they are depressed, are represented as vectors composed of (a) various task-oriented features including depression related lexicons and (b) word and document embeddings, extracted from the users’ posts. We perform an ablation study to analyze the most important features for our models. We also use BERT deep learning architecture for comparison purposes, both for depression detection and early depression detection. According to our results, well-established machine learning models are still better than more modern models for -early- detection of depression. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2022,,Studies in Computational Intelligence,1018,,111-139,,10.1007/978-3-031-04431-1_5,,#1741,Mothe 2022,"",""
Analysis of depression in social media texts through the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and natural language processing,"Kim, N.H.; Kim, J.M.; Park, D.M.; Ji, S.R.; Kim, J.W.","Objective: Although depression in modern people is emerging as a major social problem, it shows a low rate of use of mental health services. The purpose of this study was to classify sentences written by social media users based on the nine symptoms of depression in the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, using natural language processing to assess naturally users’ depression based on their results. Methods: First, train two sentence classifiers: the Y/N sentence classifier, which categorizes whether a user’s sentence is related to depression, and the 0–9 sentence classifier, which further categorizes the user sentence based on the depression symptomology of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Then the depression classifier, which is a logistic regression model, was generated to classify the sentence writer’s depression. These trained sentence classifiers and the depression classifier were used to analyze the social media textual data of users and establish their depression. Results: Our experimental results showed that the proposed depression classifier showed 68.3% average accuracy, which was better than the baseline depression classifier that used only the Y/N sentence classifier and had 53.3% average accuracy. Conclusions: This study is significant in that it demonstrates the possibility of determining depression from only social media users’ textual data. © The Author(s) 2022.",2022,,Digital Health,8,,,,10.1177/20552076221114204,,#1744,Kim 2022,"",""
Analysis and Evaluation of the Impact of Integrating Mental Health Education into the Teaching of University Civics Courses in the Context of Artificial Intelligence,"Wu, J.","In higher education teaching work, college students not only need to master the professional knowledge and professional skills they learn during their school study but also need to improve their self-education and self-cultivation and constantly improve their comprehensive ability of learning. At present, there are differences and relationships between the education of college students in civic and mental normal education, and how to play the role of the integration of the two educations has become a problem that needs to be considered in the current work of college students' training. The integration between civic education and mental normal education can make up for the shortcomings of monolithic civic education and mental normal education work and also optimize the teaching methods between them from a certain perspective to achieve the development goals of complementing each other and not being independent of each other, so that students can understand more learning methods and contents that promote the normal development of their own minds and minds. In response to the problem that mind-normal education cannot be automatically integrated into the teaching of university thought and political science courses, in the context of artificial intelligence, this paper proposes a multi-channel-based mind-normal and ideological and political information fusion model. The model has two channels, BERT+CNN and BERT and BiLSTM-Attention; firstly, the pretraining model BERT is used to obtain the word vector representation of the fused text context; then, the CNN network of channel one is used to enhance the ability of local feature extraction of the text, and the BiLSTM-Attention model of channel two enhances the ability of long sequence text processing and is key. Finally, the fused features of channel 1 and channel 2 are classified using a softmax excitation function. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, experiments are conducted on public datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.  © 2022 JingJing Wu.",2022,,Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing,2022,,,,10.1155/2022/5378694,,#1753,Wu 2022,"",""
A Natural Language Processing (NLP) Evaluation on COVID-19 Rumour Dataset Using Deep Learning Techniques,"Fatima, R.; Samad Shaikh, N.; Riaz, A.; Ahmad, S.; El-Affendi, M.A.; Alyamani, K.A.Z.; Nabeel, M.; Ali Khan, J.; Yasin, A.; Latif, R.M.A.","Context and Background: Since December 2019, the coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic has sparked considerable alarm among the general community and significantly affected societal attitudes and perceptions. Apart from the disease itself, many people suffer from anxiety and depression due to the disease and the present threat of an outbreak. Due to the fast propagation of the virus and misleading/fake information, the issues of public discourse alter, resulting in significant confusion in certain places. Rumours are unproven facts or stories that propagate and promote sentiments of prejudice, hatred, and fear. Objective. The study's objective is to propose a novel solution to detect fake news using state-of-the-art machines and deep learning models. Furthermore, to analyse which models outperformed in detecting the fake news. Method. In the research study, we adapted a COVID-19 rumours dataset, which incorporates rumours from news websites and tweets, together with information about the rumours. It is important to analyse data utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning (DL) approaches. Based on the accuracy, precision, recall, and the f1 score, we can assess the effectiveness of the ML and DL algorithms. Results. The data adopted from the source (mentioned in the paper) have collected 9200 comments from Google and 34,779 Twitter postings filtered for phrases connected with COVID-19-related fake news. Experiment 1. The dataset was assessed using the following three criteria: veracity, stance, and sentiment. In these terms, we have different labels, and we have applied the DL algorithms separately to each term. We have used different models in the experiment such as (i) LSTM and (ii) Temporal Convolution Networks (TCN). The TCN model has more performance on each measurement parameter in the evaluated results. So, we have used the TCN model for the practical implication for better findings. Experiment 2. In the second experiment, we have used different state-of-the-art deep learning models and algorithms such as (i) Simple RNN; (ii) LSTM + Word Embedding; (iii) Bidirectional + Word Embedding; (iv) LSTM + CNN-1D; and (v) BERT. Furthermore, we have evaluated the performance of these models on all three datasets, e.g., veracity, stance, and sentiment.

An optimized deep learning approach for suicide detection through Arabic tweets,"Baghdadi, N.A.; Malki, A.; Balaha, H.M.; AbdulAzeem, Y.; Badawy, M.; Elhosseini, M.","Many people worldwide suffer from mental illnesses such as major depressive disorder (MDD), which affect their thoughts, behavior, and quality of life. Suicide is regarded as the second leading cause of death among teenagers when treatment is not received. Twitter is a platform for expressing their emotions and thoughts about many subjects. Many studies, including this one, suggest using social media data to track depression and other mental illnesses. Even though Arabic is widely spoken and has a complex syntax, depressive detection methods have not been applied to the language. The Arabic tweets dataset should be scraped and annotated first. Then, a complete framework for categorizing tweet inputs into two classes (such as Normal or Suicide) is suggested in this study. The article also proposes an Arabic tweet preprocessing algorithm that contrasts lemmatization, stemming, and various lexical analysis methods. Experiments are conducted using Twitter data scraped from the Internet. Five different annotators have annotated the data. Performance metrics are reported on the suggested dataset using the latest Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) models. The measured performance metrics are balanced accuracy, specificity, F1-score, IoU, ROC, Youden Index, NPV, and weighted sum metric (WSM). Regarding USE models, the best-weighted sum metric (WSM) is 80.2%, and with regards to Arabic BERT models, the best WSM is 95.26%. © Copyright 2022 Baghdadi et al.",2022,,PeerJ Computer Science,8,,,,10.7717/PEERJ-CS.1070,,#1776,Baghdadi 2022,"",""

Identifying Co-occurring Disorders Among Patients With an Opioid-involved Hospital Encounter Using National Hospital Care Survey Data,"Brown, A.M.; White, D.G.; Adams, N.B.; O’Jiaku-Okorie, A.; Badwe, R.; Shaikh, S.; Adegboye, A.","Purpose This report documents the development of the 2016 National Hospital Care Survey (NHCS) Co-occurring Disorders Algorithm, which can be used to identify patients with an opioid-involved hospital encounter who had lifetime diagnoses of both a substance use disorder and a selected mental health issue. Lifetime diagnoses are defined as diagnoses at any point in the past or during the current encounter. This algorithm was created to complement the earlier NHCS Enhanced Opioid Identification Algorithm designed to improve the classification of patients with opioid-involved hospital encounters. Methods The Co-occurring Disorders Algorithm incorporates methodology similar to the earlier algorithm, including searches of medical codes and natural language processing (NLP) of free text clinical notes. This algorithm used information about behavioral health conditions that was found in clinical notes to determine whether encounters met all inclusion and exclusion criteria of case definitions. During the development of the algorithm, a subset of NHCS encounters were annotated by reviewers with clinical expertise to identify patients experiencing an opioid-involved hospital encounter with co-occurring disorders. These annotated records allowed for the verification of encounters identified by the algorithm. Results In the 2016 NHCS data, the algorithm identified 74,472 opioid-involved emergency department visits and 85,019 opioid-involved inpatient hospital admissions of patients with co-occurring disorders.

The generated representation is used to evaluate patient-written text from an emotional perspective. To increase the patient authored emotional lexicon, we apply synonymous semantic expansion. The EANDC method is used to classify latent semantic representations according to context. This is an explainable attention network based adaptive deep clustering approach. To increase the explainability of the learning, we used similarity metrics to select the instances that label the text to optimize the following selection using the curriculum-based optimization technique.

Listening to Mental Health Crisis Needs at Scale: Using Natural Language Processing to Understand and Evaluate a Mental Health Crisis Text Messaging Service,"Liu, Z.; Peach, R.L.; Lawrance, E.L.; Noble, A.; Ungless, M.A.; Barahona, M.","The current mental health crisis is a growing public health issue requiring a large-scale response that cannot be met with traditional services alone. Digital support tools are proliferating, yet most are not systematically evaluated, and we know little about their users and their needs. Shout is a free mental health text messaging service run by the charity Mental Health Innovations, which provides support for individuals in the UK experiencing mental or emotional distress and seeking help. Here we study a large data set of anonymised text message conversations and post-conversation surveys compiled through Shout. This data provides an opportunity to hear at scale from those experiencing distress; to better understand mental health needs for people not using traditional mental health services; and to evaluate the impact of a novel form of crisis support. We use natural language processing (NLP) to assess the adherence of volunteers to conversation techniques and formats, and to gain insight into demographic user groups and their behavioural expressions of distress.

Cross-Lingual Few-Shot Hate Speech and Offensive Language Detection Using Meta Learning,"Mozafari, M.; Farahbakhsh, R.; Crespi, N.","Automatic detection of abusive online content such as hate speech, offensive language, threats, etc. has become prevalent in social media, with multiple efforts dedicated to detecting this phenomenon in English. However, detecting hatred and abuse in low-resource languages is a non-trivial challenge. The lack of sufficient labeled data in low-resource languages and inconsistent generalization ability of transformer-based multilingual pre-trained language models for typologically diverse languages make these models inefficient in some cases. We propose a meta learning-based approach to study the problem of few-shot hate speech and offensive language detection in low-resource languages that will allow hateful or offensive content to be predicted by only observing a few labeled data items in a specific target language. We investigate the feasibility of applying a meta learning approach in cross-lingual few-shot hate speech detection by leveraging two meta learning models based on optimization-based and metric-based (MAML and Proto-MAML) methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort of this kind. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we consider hate speech and offensive language detection as two separate tasks and make two diverse collections of different publicly available datasets comprising 15 datasets across 8 languages for hate speech and 6 datasets across 6 languages for offensive language. Our experiments show that meta learning-based models outperform transfer learning-based models in a majority of cases, and that Proto-MAML is the best performing model, as it can quickly generalize and adapt to new languages with only a few labeled data points (generally, 16 samples per class yields an effective performance) to identify hateful or offensive content. © 2013 IEEE.",2022,,IEEE Access,10,,14880-14896,,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3147588,,#1815,Mozafari 2022,"",""

Multi-Label Emotion Classification on Code-Mixed Text: Data and Methods,"Ameer, I.; Sidorov, G.; Gomez-Adorno, H.; Nawab, R.M.A.","The multi-label emotion classification task aims to identify all possible emotions in a written text that best represent the author's mental state. In recent years, multi-label emotion classification attracted the attention of researchers due to its potential applications in e-learning, health care, marketing, etc. There is a need for standard benchmark corpora to develop and evaluate multi-label emotion classification methods. The majority of benchmark corpora were developed for the English language (monolingual corpora) using tweets. However, the multi-label emotion classification problem is not explored for code-mixed text, for example, English and Roman Urdu, although the code-mixed text is widely used in Facebook posts/comments, tweets, SMS messages, particularly by the South Asian community. For filling this gap, this study presents a large benchmark corpus for the multi-label emotion classification task, which comprises 11,914 code-mixed (English and Roman Urdu) SMS messages. Each code-mixed (English and Roman Urdu) SMS message manually annotated using a set of 12 emotions, including anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, love, optimism, pessimism, sadness, surprise, trust, and neutral (no emotion).

"Loneliness in older adult mental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic and before: Associations with disability, functioning and pharmacotherapy","Greig, F.; Perera, G.; Tsamakis, K.; Stewart, R.; Velayudhan, L.; Mueller, C.","Objectives: Loneliness is associated with psychiatric morbidity. Restrictions placed on the population during the first COVID-19 lockdown may have disproportionately affected older adults, possibly through increasing loneliness. We sought to investigate this by examining loneliness in referrals to mental health of older adults (MHOA) services during the first UK COVID-19 lockdown. Methods: Referrals to MHOA services from a large South London catchment area were identified for the 16-week period of the UK lockdown starting in March 2020 and for the corresponding period in 2019. A natural language processing algorithm identified loneliness in the patients' records. We applied logistic regression models adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity and diagnosis, to examine associations of loneliness in the study population. Results: 1991 referrals were identified, 56.9% of whom were female, with a mean age of 77.9 years. Only 26.9% occurred during the 2020 lockdown, but with a higher prevalence of loneliness (22.0 vs. 17.7%, p = 0.028). In the whole sample, loneliness was associated with non-accidental self-injury (Odds ratio [OR]: 1.65), depressed mood (OR: 1.73), psychotic symptoms (OR: 1.65), relationship problems (OR: 1.49), problems with daytime activities (OR: 1.36), and antidepressant use (OR: 2.11). During lockdown, loneliness was associated with non-accidental self-injury (OR: 2.52), problem drinking or drug-taking (OR 2.33), and antidepressant use (OR 2.10). Conclusions: Loneliness is associated with more severe symptoms of affective illness, worse functional problems and increased use of antidepressant medication in older adults. During lockdown, loneliness in referrals to MHOA services increased and was associated with increased risk-taking behaviour. Loneliness is a potential modifiable risk factor for mental illness, and efforts to minimise it in older adults should be prioritised as we emerge from the pandemic. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2022,,International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry,37,1,,,10.1002/gps.5630,,#1821,Greig 2022,"",""
Identifying Suicidal Ideation and Attempt from Clinical Notes within a Large Integrated Health Care System,"Xie, F.; Ling Grant, D.S.; Chang, J.; Amundsen, B.I.; Hechter, R.C.","PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to develop a natural language processing algorithm to identify suicidal ideation/attempt from free-text clinical notes. METHODS: Clinical notes containing prespecified keywords related to suicidal ideation/attempts from 2010 to 2018 were extracted from our organization’s electronic health record system. A random sample of 864 clinical notes was selected and equally divided into 4 subsets. These subsets were reviewed and classified as 1 of the following 3 suicidal ideation/attempt categories (current, historical, and no) by experienced research chart abstractors. The first 3 data sets were used to develop the rule-based computerized algorithm sequentially and the fourth data set was used to evaluate the algorithm’s performance. The validated algorithm was then applied to the entire study sample of clinical notes. RESULTS: The computerized algorithm correctly identified 23 of the 26 confirmed current suicidal ideation/attempts and all 10 confirmed historical suicidal ideation/attempts in the validation data set. It produced an 88.5% sensitivity and a 100.0% positive predictive value for current suicidal ideation/attempts, and a 100.0% sensitivity and positive predictive value for historical suicidal ideation/attempts. After applying the computerized algorithm to the entire set of study notes, we identified a total of 1,050,287 current ideation/attempt events and 293,037 historical ideation/attempt events documented in clinical notes. Those for which current ideation/attempt events were documented were more likely to be female (59.5%), 25–44 years old (28.3%), and White (43.4%). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that a computerized algorithm can effectively identify suicidal ideation/attempts from clinical notes. This algorithm can be utilized in support of suicide prevention research programs and patient care quality improvement initiatives. © 2022 The Permanente Federation.

Bert-cnn: A deep learning model for detecting emotions from text,"Abas, A.R.; Elhenawy, I.; Zidan, M.; Othman, M.","Due to the widespread usage of social media in our recent daily lifestyles, sentiment analysis becomes an important field in pattern recognition andNatural Language Processing (NLP). In this field, users' feedback data on a specific issue are evaluated and analyzed.Detecting emotions within the text is therefore considered one of the important challenges of the current NLP research. Emotions have been widely studied in psychology and behavioral science as they are an integral part of the human nature. Emotions describe a state of mind of distinct behaviors, feelings, thoughts and experiences. The main objective of this paper is to propose a new model named BERT-CNN to detect emotions from text. This model is formed by a combination of the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer (BERT) and the Convolutional Neural networks (CNN) for textual classification. This model embraces the BERT to train the word semantic representation language model. According to the word context, the semantic vector is dynamically generated and then placed into the CNN to predict the output. Results of a comparative study proved that the BERT-CNN model overcomes the state-of-art baseline performance produced by different models in the literature using the semeval 2019 task3 dataset and ISEAR datasets. The BERTCNN model achieves an accuracy of 94.7% and an F1-score of 94% for semeval2019 task3 dataset and an accuracy of 75.8% and an F1-score of 76% for ISEAR dataset. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

PASCLex: A comprehensive post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) symptom lexicon derived from electronic health record clinical notes,"Wang, L.; Foer, D.; MacPhaul, E.; Lo, Y.-C.; Bates, D.W.; Zhou, L.","Objective: To develop a comprehensive post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) symptom lexicon (PASCLex) from clinical notes to support PASC symptom identification and research. Methods: We identified 26,117 COVID-19 positive patients from the Mass General Brigham's electronic health records (EHR) and extracted 328,879 clinical notes from their post-acute infection period (day 51–110 from first positive COVID-19 test). PASCLex incorporated Unified Medical Language System® (UMLS) Metathesaurus concepts and synonyms based on selected semantic types. The MTERMS natural language processing (NLP) tool was used to automatically extract symptoms from a development dataset. The lexicon was iteratively revised with manual chart review, keyword search, concept consolidation, and evaluation of NLP output. We assessed the comprehensiveness of PASCLex and the NLP performance using a validation dataset and reported the symptom prevalence across the entire corpus. Results: PASCLex included 355 symptoms consolidated from 1520 UMLS concepts of 16,466 synonyms. NLP achieved an averaged precision of 0.94 and an estimated recall of 0.84. Symptoms with the highest frequency included pain (43.1%), anxiety (25.8%), depression (24.0%), fatigue (23.4%), joint pain (21.0%), shortness of breath (20.8%), headache (20.0%), nausea and/or vomiting (19.9%), myalgia (19.0%), and gastroesophageal reflux (18.6%). Discussion and conclusion: PASC symptoms are diverse. A comprehensive lexicon of PASC symptoms can be derived using an ontology-driven, EHR-guided and NLP-assisted approach.

Active deep learning to detect cognitive concerns in electronic health records,"Magdamo, C.G.; Hong, Z.M.; Noori, A.; Sheu, Y.-H.; Deodhar, M.; Ye, E.M.; Ge, W.; Sun, H.; Brenner, L.; Robbins, G.K.; Mukerji, S.; Zafar, S.F.; Benson, N.; Moura, L.M.V.; Hsu, J.; Arnold, S.E.; Hyman, B.T.; Serrano-Pozo, A.; Westover, M.B.; Blacker, D.; Das, S.","BACKGROUND: Timely diagnosis of dementia is important to patients and their caregivers for advanced planning, yet dementia is under-diagnosed by healthcare professionals and under-coded in claims data. Sensitive and specific tools to detect cognitive concerns in diverse clinical settings could prompt referral for cognitive evaluation and specialist care. METHOD: We developed a deep learning natural language processing (NLP) method to detect cognitive concerns in unstructured clinician notes from electronic health records (EHR). We leveraged a gold-standard set of ∼1000 patients sampled randomly from three strata: patients with diagnosis codes, patients with specialist visits but no code, or patients with neither. The physician performed a detailed chart review and adjudication of cognitive status, noting ""cognitive concern"" (i.e., any evidence of cognitive difficulties) and rating patients on a 5-point scale: normal, normal vs. MCI, MCI, MCI vs. dementia, and dementia. We used 10% of the labeled data as a test set and the remaining 90% for training and validation of the model to classify patients with any cognitive concerns (normal vs. other). We also built a web-based chart review annotation tool that facilitates labeling and enables an active learning loop to scale up labeling to thousands of charts. RESULT: In a random sample from the gold-standard dataset, 30 out of 80 patients with cognitive concerns had no diagnosis code or medication related to dementia; we hypothesized that our deep learning tool could leverage clinical text to improve detection of cognitive concerns. Indeed, a model with codes and medications had an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of 0.79, sensitivity of 0.59, and specificity of 1.00 for the binary classification task. The deep learning model improved the AUROC to 0.90, increased sensitivity to 0.79, and maintained specificity of 0.98. Notes from primary care, specialties such as neurology and psychiatry, and social workers had the highest likelihood of containing information. CONCLUSION: The deep learning model was successful in detecting cases without a dementia-related diagnosis code or medication. Automatic processing of electronic medical records with a deep learning tool can be used for early detection of cognitive concern to optimize patient care and predict hospital readmission. © 2021 the Alzheimer's Association.",2021,,Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,17,,e055362,,10.1002/alz.055362,,#1828,Magdamo 2021,"",""
Aggregating twitter text through generalized linear regression models for tweet popularity prediction and automatic topic classification,"Mo, C.; Yin, J.; Fung, I.C.-H.; Tse, Z.T.H.","Social media platforms have become accessible resources for health data analysis. How-ever, the advanced computational techniques involved in big data text mining and analysis are chal-lenging for public health data analysts to apply. This study proposes and explores the feasibility of a novel yet straightforward method by regressing the outcome of interest on the aggregated influence scores for association and/or classification analyses based on generalized linear models. The method reduces the document term matrix by transforming text data into a continuous summary score, thereby reducing the data dimension substantially and easing the data sparsity issue of the term matrix. To illustrate the proposed method in detailed steps, we used three Twitter datasets on various topics: autism spectrum disorder, influenza, and violence against women. We found that our results were generally consistent with the critical factors associated with the specific public health topic in the existing literature. The proposed method could also classify tweets into different topic groups appropriately with consistent performance compared with existing text mining methods for automatic classification based on tweet contents. © 2021 by the authors.",2021,,"European Journal of Investigation in Health, Psychology and Education",11,4,,,10.3390/ejihpe11040109,,#1831,Mo 2021,"",""
Developing online lectures using text mining reduces health workers’ anxiety in non-epicenter areas of COVID-19,"Ogasawara, M.; Uematsu, H.; Hayashi, K.; Osugi, Y.","COVID-19 is indirectly associated with various mental disorders such as anxiety, insomnia, and depression, and healthcare professionals who treat COVID-19 patients are particularly prone to severe anxiety. However, neither the anxiety of healthcare workers in non-epicenter areas nor the effects of knowledge support have been examined thus far. Participants were 458 staff working at the Toyota Regional Medical Center who completed a preliminary questionnaire of their knowledge and anxiety regarding COVID-19. Based on text mining of the questionnaire responses, participants were offered an online lecture. The effect of the lecture was analyzed using a pre and post-lecture rating of anxiety and knowledge confidence, and quantitative text mining. The response rates were 45.6% pre and 62.9% post-lecture. Open-ended responses regarding anxiety and knowledge were classified into seven clusters using a co-occurrence network. Before the lecture, 28.2%, 27.2%, and 20.3% of participants were interested in and anxious about “infection prevention and our hospital’s response,” “infection and impact on myself, family, and neighbors,” and “general knowledge of COVID-19,” respectively. As a result of the lecture, Likert-scale ratings for anxiety of COVID-19 decreased significantly and knowledge confidence increased significantly. These changes were confirmed by analyses of open-ended responses about anxiety, lifestyle changes, and knowledge. Positive changes were strongly linked to the topics focused on in the lecture, especially infection prevention. The anxieties about COVID-19 of healthcare workers in non-epicenter areas can be effectively reduced through questionnaire surveys and online lectures using text mining. © 2022, Nagoya Journal of Medical Science.

The social pandemic from SARS-CoV-2 among Italian university students: a pilot study,"Russo, C.; Giordano, G.; Marsico, G.","The impact of restrictions on movement resulting from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may contribute to a disruption of mental health in young people during this era. In March 2021, lockdown restrictions were enforcing national policies of tackling the infectious disease across the globe. In the early stages of the vaccination rollout, public enquires on confidence to endure the virus pandemic have shown high levels of psychological distress. Under the above circumstances, 333 university students were asked to fill in an online-based survey on alcohol consumption, compulsive behavior as a loss of control over eating, fear of weight changes, excessive sleepiness and sleep deprivation. Text mining and multiple correspondence analysis were employed to analyze qualitative data on the lived experience against the occurrence of health-related behaviors. Data analyses have showed that the pandemic was associated with a mixed breakup of clustered lemmas based on sex, age, and relationship status. The extent to which the participants have reported a lower degree of satisfaction on living arrangements, intimate and family relationships were interpreted as meaningfully related with a more negative lived experience. Social confinement has resulted as an immediate action for mitigating a public health crisis from the SARS-CoV-2 disease. Incidentally, social measures to mitigate the virus transmission have sought to protect internal collapse of the health care systems by reducing the number of casualties.

Design χ 2 and logistic regression were used to assess the profile of patients receiving mental healthcare for whom quotations exist. K-means clustering using pre-trained word embeddings developed on general discharge summaries and psychosis specific mental health records were used to group one-word quotations into semantically similar groups and labelled by human subjective judgement. Setting EHRs from a large mental healthcare provider serving a geographic catchment area of 1.3 million residents in South London. Participants For analysis of distribution, 33 499 individuals receiving mental healthcare on 30 June 2019 in South London and Maudsley. For analysis of content, 1587 unique lemmatised words, appearing a minimum of 20 times on the database of quotations created on 16 January 2020. Results The strongest individual indicator of quoted text is inpatient care in the preceding 12 months (OR 9.79, 95% CI 7.84 to 12.23). Next highest indicator is ethnicity with those with a black background more likely to have quoted text in comparison to white background (OR 2.20, 95% CI 2.08 to 2.33). Both are attenuated slightly in the adjusted model. Early psychosis intervention word embeddings subjectively produced categories pertaining to: mental illness, verbs, negative sentiment, people/relationships, mixed sentiment, aggression/violence and negative connotation. Conclusions The findings that inpatients and those from a black ethnic background more commonly have quoted text raise important questions around where clinical attention is focused and whether this may point to any systematic bias. Our study also shows that word embeddings trained on early psychosis intervention records are useful in categorising even small subsets of the clinical records represented by one-word quotations. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

Short-Text Classification Detector: A Bert-Based Mental Approach,"Hu, Y.; Ding, J.; Dou, Z.; Chang, H.","With the continuous development of the Internet, social media based on short text has become popular. However, the sparsity and shortness of essays will restrict the accuracy of text classification. Therefore, based on the Bert model, we capture the mental feature of reviewers and apply them for short text classification to improve its classification accuracy. Specifically, we construct a model text at the language level and fine tune the model to better embed mental features. To verify the accuracy of this method, we compare a variety of machine learning methods, such as support vector machine, convolution neural networks, and recurrent neural networks. The results show the following: (1) Through feature comparison, it is found that mental features can significantly improve the accuracy of short text classification. (2) Combining mental features and text as input vectors can provide more classification accuracy than separating them as two independent vectors. (3) Through model comparison, it can be found that Bert model can integrate mental features and short text. Bert can better capture mental features to improve the accuracy of classification results.

Materials and methods: Eight human annotators assigned four ICF categories to relevant sentences: Emotional functions, Exercise tolerance, Walking and Moving, Work and Employment and their ICF levels (Functional Ambulation Categories for Walking and Moving, metabolic equivalents for Exercise tolerance). A linguistic neural network-based model was trained on 80% of the annotated sentences; inter-annotator agreement (IAA, Cohen’s kappa), a weighted score of precision and recall (F1) and RMSE for level detection were assessed for the remaining 20%. Results: In total 4112 sentences of non-COVID-19 and 1061 of COVID-19 patients were annotated. Average IAA was 0.81; F1 scores were 0.7 for Walking and Moving and Emotional functions; RMSE for Walking and Moving (5- level scale) was 1.17 for COVID-19 patients.

CARES: CAuse Recognition for Emotion in Suicide Notes,"Ghosh, S.; Roy, S.; Ekbal, A.; Bhattacharyya, P.","Inspired by recent advances in emotion-cause extraction in texts and its potential in research on computational studies in suicide motives and tendencies and mental health, we address the problem of cause identification and cause extraction for emotion in suicide notes. We introduce an emotion-cause annotated suicide corpus of 5769 sentences by labeling the benchmark CEASE-v2.0 dataset (4932 sentences) with causal spans for existing annotated emotions. Furthermore, we expand the utility of the existing dataset by adding emotion and emotion cause annotations for an additional 837 sentences collected from 67 non-English suicide notes (Hindi, Bangla, Telugu). Our proposed approaches to emotion-cause identification and extraction are based on pre-trained transformer-based models that attain performance figures of 83.20% accuracy and 0.76 Ratcliff-Obershelp similarity, respectively. The findings suggest that existing computational methods can be adapted to address these challenging tasks, opening up new research areas. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2022,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),13186 LNCS,,128-136,,10.1007/978-3-030-99739-7_15,,#1854,Ghosh 2022,"",""
Research on sentiment classification for netizens based on the BERT-BiLSTMTextCNN model,"Jiang, X.; Song, C.; Xu, Y.; Li, Y.; Peng, Y.","Sentiment analysis of netizens’ comments can accurately grasp the psychology of netizens and reduce the risks brought by online public opinion. However, there is currently no effective method to solve the problems of short text, open word range, and sometimes reversed word order in comments. To better solve the above problems, this article proposes a hybrid model of sentiment classification, which is based on bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) and a text convolution neural network (TextCNN) (BERT-BiLSTM-TextCNN). The experimental results show that (1) the hybrid model proposed in this article can better combine the advantages of BiLSTM and TextCNN; it not only captures local correlation while retaining context information but also has high accuracy and stability. (2) The BERT-BiLSTMTextCNN model can extract important emotional information more flexibly in text and achieve multiclass classification tasks of emotions more accurately. The innovations of this study are as follows: (1) the use of BERT to generate word vectors has the advantages of more prior information and a full combination of contextual semantics; (2) the BiLSTM model, as a bidirectional context mechanism model, can obtain contextual information well; and (3) the TextCNN model can obtain important features well in the problem of text classification, and the combined effect of the three modules can significantly improve the accuracy of emotional multilabel classification. © Copyright 2022 Jiang et al.",2022,,PeerJ Computer Science,8,,,,10.7717/PEERJ-CS.1005,,#1855,Jiang 2022,"",""
Negative Emotions Sensitive Humanoid Robot with Attention-Enhanced Facial Expression Recognition Network,"Ni, R.; Liu, X.; Chen, Y.; Zhou, X.; Cai, H.; Kiong, L.C.","Lonely older adults and persons restricted in movements are apt to cause negative emotions, which is harmful to their mental health. A humanoid robot with audiovisual interactions is presented, which can correspondingly output positive facial expressions to relieve human's negative facial expressions. The negative emotions are identified through an attention-enhanced facial expression recognition (FER) network. The network is firstly trained on MMEW macro-and micro-expression databases to discover expression-related features. Then, macro-expression recognition tasks are performed by fine-tuning the trained models on several benchmarking FER databases, including CK+ and Oulu-CASIA. A transformer network is introduced to process the sequential features engineered by the FER network and output a final stable control order. This order is used to control the robot's facial motor units to generate different expressions, e.g., a smile expression. Evaluations on benchmarking databases verify that the proposed method can precisely recognize facial expressions. The joint modulation with the humanoid robot proves that the robot can respond effectively to the user's negative emotions. © 2022, Tech Science Press.

Sentimental Analysis of Tweets During COVID-19 Pandemic: BERT Algorithm,"Kaur, G.; Saini, M.; Chhabra, A.","As the coronavirus (COVID-19) grows its impact from China, expanding its catchment into surrounding regions and other countries, increased national and international measures are being taken to contain the outbreak. This perspective paper is written to capture and analyze the various mental state health issues being perceived via emotional analysis of Twitter data during the COVID-19 virus outbreak from a single nation further spread of to the whole world. A data-driven approach with higher accuracy as here can be very useful for a proactive response from the government and citizens. In the proposed work, tweets during the COVID situation have been collected and their sentiments are explored using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformer) algorithm. BERT is the algorithm that takes text as input, and the trained basis on the epochs (number of passes performed). The performance parameters are computed such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure. Further, the proposed approach is compared with other existing algorithms such as Naïve Bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression (LR). The performance measures indicate that the BERT algorithm outperforms all other existing algorithms with an accuracy of 86.7% as compared to 67.3%, 63.4%, and 61.2% with Naïve Bayes, support vector machine, and logistic regression, respectively.

Exploring cyber violence against women and girls in the Philippines through Mining Online News,"Febro-Naga, J.-D.; Tinam-isan, M.-A.-C.","Violence against women and girls (VAWG) is not a recent phenomenon. What is new is the additional increasing threats that millions of women and girls face because of the rapid spread of ICTs and the expansion of social media. Cases of VAWG wherein ICT and social media are used as platforms by cybercriminals can be seen in the news media coverage. This study aims to understand and determine the trend and the state of cyber VAWG to raise awareness through mining online news websites. News articles were scraped from popular news websites between 2015 to 2020. The preprocessed articles (N=3,506) were analyzed by year using the Topic Keyword Model (TKM). It was observed that the cyber VAWG articles topic trends are increasing with most of the articles focusing on the topics “Online sexual exploitation and sexual abuse of children” and “ICT-related violations of privacy”. Text mining methods may address the limitations of traditional qualitative approaches. Understanding the cyber VAWG issues by mining news articles is a novel approach that could help create programs and policies to address this societal concern. Additional studies should be conducted related to sentiment analysis of news data to verify and measure the influence of cyber VAWG-related topics. © 2021.

To recognize abnormal T-cell and B-cell subsets for SLE patients with anxiety, in this study, patient disease phenotypes data from electronic lupus symptom records were extracted by using natural language processing. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to distinguish patients, and 107 patients were selected to meet research requirements. Then, peripheral blood was collected from two patient groups for multicolor flow cytometry experiments. The characteristics of 75 T-cell and 15 B-cell subsets were investigated between SLE patients with- (n = 23) and without-anxiety (n = 84) groups by four machine learning methods. The findings showed 13 T-cell subsets were significantly different between the two groups. Furthermore, BMI, fatigue, depression, unstable emotions, CD27+CD28+ Th/Treg, CD27−CD28− Th/Treg, CD45RA−CD27− Th, and CD45RA+HLADR+ Th cells may be important characteristics between SLE patients with- and without-anxiety groups. The findings not only point out the difference of T-cell subsets in SLE patients with or without anxiety, but also imply that T cells might play the important role in patients with anxiety disorder.

Monitoring Depression Trends on Twitter During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Observational Study,"Zhang, Y.; Lyu, H.; Liu, Y.; Zhang, X.; Wang, Y.; Luo, J.","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected people’s daily lives and has caused economic loss worldwide. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the pandemic has increased depression levels among the population. However, systematic studies of depression detection and monitoring during the pandemic are lacking. Objective: This study aims to develop a method to create a large-scale depression user data set in an automatic fashion so that the method is scalable and can be adapted to future events; verify the effectiveness of transformer-based deep learning language models in identifying depression users from their everyday language; examine psychological text features’ importance when used in depression classification; and, finally, use the model for monitoring the fluctuation of depression levels of different groups as the disease propagates. Methods: To study this subject, we designed an effective regular expression-based search method and created the largest English Twitter depression data set containing 2575 distinct identified users with depression and their past tweets. To examine the effect of depression on people’s Twitter language, we trained three transformer-based depression classification models on the data set, evaluated their performance with progressively increased training sizes, and compared the model’s tweet chunk-level and user-level performances. Furthermore, inspired by psychological studies, we created a fusion classifier that combines deep learning model scores with psychological text features and users’ demographic information, and investigated these features’ relations to depression signals. Finally, we demonstrated our model’s capability of monitoring both group-level and population-level depression trends by presenting two of its applications during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Our fusion model demonstrated an accuracy of 78.9% on a test set containing 446 people, half of which were identified as having depression. Conscientiousness, neuroticism, appearance of first person pronouns, talking about biological processes such as eat and sleep, talking about power, and exhibiting sadness were shown to be important features in depression classification. Further, when used for monitoring the depression trend, our model showed that depressive users, in general, responded to the pandemic later than the control group based on their tweets (n=500). It was also shown that three US states—New York, California, and Florida—shared a similar depression trend as the whole US population (n=9050). When compared to New York and California, people in Florida demonstrated a substantially lower level of depression. Conclusions: This study proposes an efficient method that can be used to analyze the depression level of different groups of people on Twitter. We hope this study can raise awareness among researchers and the public of COVID-19’s impact on people’s mental health. The noninvasive monitoring system can also be readily adapted to other big events besides COVID-19 and can be useful during future outbreaks. © Yipeng Zhang, Hanjia Lyu, Yubao Liu, Xiyang Zhang, Yu Wang, Jiebo Luo.",2021,,JMIR Infodemiology,1,1,,,10.2196/26769,,#1871,Zhang 2021,"Dmitry Scherbakov (2024-06-10 15:03:35)(Select): 5

A Virtual Coach (Motibot) for Supporting Healthy Coping Strategies Among Adults With Diabetes: Proof-of-Concept Study,"Bassi, G.; Giuliano, C.; Perinelli, A.; Forti, S.; Gabrielli, S.; Salcuni, S.","Background: Motivation is a core component of diabetes self-management because it allows adults with diabetes mellitus (DM) to adhere to clinical recommendations. In this context, virtual coaches (VCs) have assumed a central role in supporting and treating common barriers related to adherence. However, most of them are mainly focused on medical and physical purposes, such as the monitoring of blood glucose levels or following a healthy diet. Objective: This proof-of-concept study aims to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of a VC intervention for psychosocial support before and after the intervention and at follow-up. The intent of this VC is to motivate adults with type 1 DM and type 2 DM to adopt and cultivate healthy coping strategies to reduce symptoms of depression, anxiety, perceived stress, and diabetes-related emotional distress, while also improving their well-being. Methods: A total of 13 Italian adults with DM (18-51 years) interacted with a VC, called Motibot (motivational bot) using the Telegram messaging app. The interaction covered 12 sessions, each lasting 10 to 20 minutes, during which the user could dialogue with the VC by inputting text or tapping an option on their smartphone screen. Motibot is developed within the transtheoretical model of change to deliver the most appropriate psychoeducational intervention based on the user’s motivation to change. Results: Results showed that over the 12 sessions, there were no significant changes before and after the intervention and at follow-up regarding psychosocial factors. However, most users showed a downward trend over the 3 time periods in depression and anxiety symptoms, thereby presenting good psychological well-being and no diabetes-related emotional distress. In addition, users felt motivated, involved, encouraged, emotionally understood, and stimulated by Motibot during the interaction. Indeed, the analyses of semistructured interviews, using a text mining approach, showed that most users reported a perceived reduction in anxiety, depression, and/or stress symptoms. Moreover, users indicated the usefulness of Motibot in supporting and motivating them to find a mindful moment for themselves and to reflect on their own emotions. Conclusions: Motibot was well accepted by users, particularly because of the inclusion of mindfulness practices, which motivated them to adopt healthy coping skills. To this extent, Motibot provided psychosocial support for adults with DM, particularly for those with mild and moderate symptoms, whereas those with severe symptoms may benefit more from face-to-face psychotherapy. © Giulia Bassi, Claudio Giuliano, Alessio Perinelli, Stefano Forti, Silvia Gabrielli, Silvia Salcuni.",2022,,JMIR Human Factors,9,1,,,10.2196/32211,,#1872,Bassi 2022,"",""
"How loneliness is talked about in social media during COVID-19 pandemic: Text mining of 4,492 Twitter feeds","Koh, J.X.; Liew, T.M.","Background: Loneliness is a public health problem that is expected to rise during the COVID-19 pandemic, given the widespread policy of quarantine. The literature is unclear whether loneliness during COVID-19 is similar to those of non-pandemic seasons. This study examined the expression of loneliness on Twitter during COVID-19 pandemic, and identified key areas of loneliness across diverse communities. Methods: Twitter was searched for feeds that were:(1) in English; (2) posted from May 1, 2020 to July 1, 2020; (3) posted by individual users (not organisations); and (4) contained the words ‘loneliness’ and ‘COVID-19’. A machine-learning approach (Topic Modeling) identified key topics from the Twitter feeds; Hierarchical Modeling identified overarching themes. Variations in the prevalence of the themes were examined over time and across the number of followers of the Twitter users. Results: 4492 Twitter feeds were included and classified into 3 themes: (1) Community impact of loneliness during COVID-19; (2) Social distancing during COVID-19 and its effects on loneliness; and (3) Mental health effects of loneliness during COVID-19. The 3 themes demonstrated temporal variations. Particularly in Europe, Theme 1 showed a drastic reduction over time, with a corresponding rise in Theme 3. The themes also varied across number of followers. Highly influential users were more likely to talk about Theme 3 and less about Theme 2. Conclusions: The findings reflect close-to-real-time public sentiments on loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic and demonstrated the potential usefulness of social media to keep tabs on evolving mental health issues.

Drug Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning Classifiers,"Uddin, M.N.; Hafi, M.F.B.; Hossain, S.; Islam, S.M.M.","In recent times, one of the most emerging sub-dimensions of natural language processing is sentiment analysis which refers to analyzing opinion on a particular subject from plain text. Drug sentiment analysis has become very significant in present times as classifying medicines based on their effectiveness through analyzing reviews from users can assist potential future consumers in gaining knowledge and making better decisions about a particular drug. The objective of this proposed research is to measure the effectiveness level of a particular drug. Currently most of the text mining researches are based on unsupervised machine learning methods to cluster data. When supervised learning methods are used for text mining, the usual primary concern is to classify the data into two classes. Lack of technical terms in similar datasets make the categorization even more challenging. The proposed research focuses on finding out the keywords through tokenization and lemmatization so that better accuracy can be achieved for categorizing the drugs based on their effectiveness using different algorithms. Such categorization can be instrumental for treating illness as well as improve one’s health and well-being. Four machine learning algorithms have been applied for binary classification and one for multiclass classification on the drug review dataset acquired from the UCI machine learning repository. The machine learning algorithms used for binary classification are naive Bayes classifier, random forest, support vector classifier (SVC), and multilayer perceptron; among these machine learning algorithms, linear SVC was used for multiclass classification. Results obtained from these four classifier algorithms have been analyzed to evaluate their performances. The random forest has been proven to have the best performance among these four algorithms. However, multiclass classification was found to have low performance when applied to natural language processing.

Design and setting This study was a retrospective cohort study within a secondary mental health service, South London and Maudsley National Health Service Trust. Participants All diagnosed with an F50 diagnosis of eating disorder from January 2009 to September 2019 were included. Intervention and measures Electronic health records (EHRs) for these patients were extracted and two natural language processing tools were used to determine documentation of self-harm and suicidality in their clinical notes. These tools were validated manually for attribute agreement scores within this study. Results The attribute agreements for precision of positive mentions of self-harm were 0.96 and for suicidality were 0.80; this demonstrates a € near perfect' and € strong' agreement and highlights the reliability of the tools in identifying the EHRs reporting self-harm or suicidality. There were 7434 patients with EHRs available and diagnosed with eating disorders included in the study from the dates January 2007 to September 2019. Of these, 4591 (61.8%) had a mention of self-harm within their records and 4764 (64.0%) had a mention of suicidality; 3899 (52.4%) had mentions of both. Patients reporting either self-harm or suicidality were more likely to have a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa (AN) (self-harm, AN OR=3.44, 95% CI 1.05 to 11.3, p=0.04; suicidality, AN OR=8.20, 95% CI 2.17 to 30.1; p=0.002). They were also more likely to have a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder (p≤0.001), bipolar disorder (p<0.001) or substance misuse disorder (p<0.001). Conclusion A high percentage of patients (>60%) diagnosed with eating disorders report either self-harm or suicidal thoughts. Relative to other eating disorders, those diagnosed with AN were more likely to report either self-harm or suicidal thoughts. Psychiatric comorbidity, in particular borderline personality disorder and substance misuse, was also associated with an increase risk in self-harm and suicidality.

Development of a Lexicon for Pain,"Chaturvedi, J.; Mascio, A.; Velupillai, S.U.; Roberts, A.","Pain has been an area of growing interest in the past decade and is known to be associated with mental health issues. Due to the ambiguous nature of how pain is described in text, it presents a unique natural language processing (NLP) challenge. Understanding how pain is described in text and utilizing this knowledge to improve NLP tasks would be of substantial clinical importance. Not much work has previously been done in this space. For this reason, and in order to develop an English lexicon for use in NLP applications, an exploration of pain concepts within free text was conducted. The exploratory text sources included two hospital databases, a social media platform (Twitter), and an online community (Reddit). This exploration helped select appropriate sources and inform the construction of a pain lexicon. The terms within the final lexicon were derived from three sources—literature, ontologies, and word embedding models. This lexicon was validated by two clinicians as well as compared to an existing 26-term pain sub-ontology and MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms.

"Challenging suicide, burnout, and depression among veterinary practitioners and students: text mining and topics modelling analysis of the scientific literature","Brscic, M.; Contiero, B.; Schianchi, A.; Marogna, C.","Background: Worldwide, veterinary practitioners and students are reported to be at higher risk of suicide, burnout, and depression compared to other occupational groups. The aim of the current study was to apply text mining and topic modelling analysis on scientific literature regarding suicide, burnout, and depression among veterinary practitioners and students to extract meaningful and synthetic information. These statistical approaches can be used to comprehend more in deep the phenomena involving veterinarians and veterinary students and to suggest the potential changes needed in admission to veterinary school, veterinary curricula, and post-graduation initiatives as preventive actions. Results: A systematic search protocol was set up to identify scientific literature that published on the topic from 1985 to 2019. Two-hundred-eleven records were selected with abstracts/texts submitted to text mining and topic modelling analysis. Student, stress, work, anim*, and euthanasia resulted the most frequent terms. Topics modelling allowed to differentiate groups of words and papers in 3 areas of interest: 1) students’ difficulties encountered during their studies that increase stress and anxiety impairing their psychological health; 2) exposure to death and euthanasia as risk factor for mental health; and 3) need of support among those providing medical and health care, and of supportive group work to cope with such profession. Conclusion: Based on the most frequent words included in the clouds and on the contents of the papers clusterised in them, some suggestions are interfered. It is emphasized that the veterinary curricula should include courses that prepare them early to deal with animal death and post-death grief of pet owners, to handle ethical dilemmas and moral stressors, to communicate with clients and staff members, to work in team, to balance work-family life and to promote individual and team resources. Specific courses for veterinary practitioners could keep them updated on their new roles and ways to handle them among functioning as potential feedbacks to monitor their psychological wellbeing. © 2021, The Author(s).",2021,,BMC Veterinary Research,17,1,,,10.1186/s12917-021-03000-x,,#1883,Brscic 2021,"",""
ACCU3RATE: A mobile health application rating scale based on user reviews,"Biswas, M.; Tania, M.H.; Shamim Kaiser, M.; Kabir, R.; Mahmud, M.; Kemal, A.A.","Background Over the last decade, mobile health applications (mHealth App) have evolved exponentially to assess and support our health and well-being. Objective This paper presents an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled mHealth app rating tool, called ACCU3RATE, which takes multidimensional measures such as user star rating, user review and features declared by the developer to generate the rating of an app. However, currently, there is very little conceptual understanding on how user reviews affect app rating from a multi-dimensional perspective. This study applies AI-based text mining technique to develop more comprehensive understanding of user feedback based on several important factors, determining the mHealth app ratings. Method Based on the literature, six variables were identified that influence the mHealth app rating scale. These factors are user star rating, user text review, user interface (UI) design, functionality, security and privacy, and clinical approval. Natural Language Toolkit package is used for interpreting text and to identify the App users’ sentiment. Additional considerations were accessibility, protection and privacy, UI design for people living with physical disability. Moreover, the details of clinical approval, if exists, were taken from the developer’s statement. Finally, we fused all the inputs using fuzzy logic to calculate the new app rating score. Results and conclusions ACCU3RATE concentrates on heart related Apps found in the play store and App gallery. The findings indicate the efficacy of the proposed method as opposed to the current device scale. This study has implications for both App developers and consumers who are using mHealth Apps to monitor and track their health. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed mHealth scale has shown excellent reliability as well as internal consistency of the scale, and high inter-rater reliability index. It has also been noticed that the fuzzy based rating scale, as in ACCU3RATE, matches more closely to the rating performed by experts. © 2021 Biswas et al.

A Novel Text Mining Approach for Mental Health Prediction Using Bi-LSTM and BERT Model,"Zeberga, K.; Attique, M.; Shah, B.; Ali, F.; Jembre, Y.Z.; Chung, T.-S.","With the current advancement in the Internet, there has been a growing demand for building intelligent and smart systems that can efficiently address the detection of health-related problems on social media, such as the detection of depression and anxiety. These types of systems, which are mainly dependent on machine learning techniques, must be able to deal with obtaining the semantic and syntactic meaning of texts posted by users on social media. The data generated by users on social media contains unstructured and unpredictable content. Several systems based on machine learning and social media platforms have recently been introduced to identify health-related problems. However, the text representation and deep learning techniques employed provide only limited information and knowledge about the different texts posted by users. This is owing to a lack of long-term dependencies between each word in the entire text and a lack of proper exploitation of recent deep learning schemes. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to efficiently and effectively identify depression and anxiety-related posts while maintaining the contextual and semantic meaning of the words used in the whole corpus when applying bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT). In addition, we propose a knowledge distillation technique, which is a recent technique for transferring knowledge from a large pretrained model (BERT) to a smaller model to boost performance and accuracy. We also devised our own data collection framework from Reddit and Twitter, which are the most common social media sites. Finally, we employed word2vec and BERT with Bi-LSTM to effectively analyze and detect depression and anxiety signs from social media posts. Our system surpasses other state-of-the-art methods and achieves an accuracy of 98% using the knowledge distillation technique. © 2022 Kamil Zeberga et al.",2022,,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,2022,,,,10.1155/2022/7893775,,#1887,Zeberga 2022,"",""
Big Data Analysis of the Key Attributes Related to Stress and Mental Health in Korean Taekwondo Student Athletes,"Park, S.; Jeon, J.; Ahn, H.; Yang, Y.; So, W.","In the present study, we used big data analysis to examine the key attributes related to stress and mental health among Korean Taekwondo student-athletes. Keywords included “Taekwondo + Student athlete + Stress + Mental health”. Naver and Google databases were searched to identify research published between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2019. Text-mining analysis was performed on unstructured texts using TEXTOM 4.5, with social network analysis performed using UCINET 6. In total, 3149 large databases (1.346 MB) were analyzed. Two types of text-mining analyses were performed, namely, frequency analysis and term frequency-inverse document frequency analysis. For the social network analysis, the degree centrality and convergence of iterated correlation analysis were used to deduce the node-linking degree in the network and to identify clusters. The top 10 most frequently used terms were “stress,” “Taekwondo,” “health,” “player,” “student,” “mental,” “exercise,” “mental health,” “relieve,” and “child.” The top 10 most frequently occurring results of the TF-IDF analysis were “Taekwondo”, “health”, “player”, “exercise”, “student”, “mental”, “stress”, “mental health”, “child” and “relieve”. The degree centrality analysis yielded similar results regarding the top 10 terms. The convergence of iterated correlation analysis identified six clusters: student, start of dream, diet, physical and mental, sports activity, and adult Taekwondo center. Our results emphasize the importance of designing interventions that attenuate stress and improve mental health among Korean Taekwondo student-athletes. © 2022 by the authors.

"Compassion Detection from Text: A Comparative Analysis Using BERT, ULMFiT and DeepMoji","Awasthi, G.; Sabapathy, R.; Mittal, C.; Chattopadhyay, N.","Compassion is a key quality of the human condition. For computers to become artificial general intelligence (AGI), they must be taught how to detect and exhibit compassion. Detection of compassion requires both a definition and proper approaches. A definition of compassion, which has both cognitive and affective components, can be found in clinical psychology, encompassing the recognition of suffering and a desire to help, among other aspects. We use this definition to annotate a new original text dataset for compassion detection created by Web crawling Reddit communities. This dataset represents the first contribution of this paper. Using this new annotated dataset, we examine three approaches which are currently prevalent in the area of emotion detection (ED), based on BERT (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers), ULMFiT (universal language model fine-tuning) and DeepMoji (which uses attention-based bidirectional LSTM without transformers). We show that: (a) an approach based on feeding the emoji-based embeddings from DeepMoji to an ensemble of classifiers performs slightly better than BERT and much better than ULMFiT on our compassion detection dataset; (b) It is easier to detect the compassionate class than the not compassionate class. We also analyze two other related datasets, one on politeness and one on insults, and find that the approach of feeding the emoji-based embeddings from DeepMoji to a downstream classifier is only slightly inferior in performance to a BERT classifier, thus warranting consideration in tasks involving affective aspects. This comparative analysis is the second contribution of this paper toward the ED from text literature. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",2022,,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,806,,473-488,,10.1007/978-981-16-6448-9_47,,#1891,Awasthi 2022,"",""
Detection of traits in students with suicidal tendencies on Internet applying Web Mining,"Castillo-Zúñiga, I.; Luna-Rosas, F.-J.; López-Veyna, J.-I.","This article presents an Internet data analysis model based on Web Mining with the aim to find knowledge about large amounts of data in cyberspace. To test the proposed method, suicide web pages were analyzed as a study case to identify and detect traits in students with suicidal tendencies. The procedure considers a Web Scraper to locate and download information from the Internet, as well as Natural Language Processing techniques to retrieve the words. To explore the information, a dataset based on Dynamic Tables and Semantic Ontologies was constructed, specifying the predictive variables in young people with suicidal inclination. Finally, to evaluate the efficiency of the model, Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms were used. It should be noticed that the procedures for the construction of the dataset (using Genetic Algorithms) and obtaining the knowledge (using Parallel Computing and Acceleration with GPU) were optimized. The results reveal an accuracy of 96.28% on the detection of characteristics in adolescents with suicidal tendencies, reaching the best result through a Recurrent Neural Network with 98% accuracy.

Automated identification of domestic violence in written child welfare records: Leveraging text mining and machine learning to enhance social work research and evaluation,"Victor, B.G.; Perron, B.E.; Sokol, R.L.; Fedina, L.; Ryan, J.P.","Objective: Child welfare agencies often lack information about the front-end service needs of the families they serve. Thus, the current study tests the feasibility of text mining and machine learning procedures for identifying problems related to domestic violence documented in child welfare investigation summaries. Method: We labeled child welfare investigation summaries (N 5 1,402) for the presence or absence of an active domestic violence service need. Labeled documents were then used to develop text mining and machine learning models and test their accuracy and reliability. Results: Machine learning models achieved greater than 90% accuracy when compared with human coders. Fleiss kappa estimates of coding reliability between the top-performing model and human reviewers exceeded .80, indicating that our model could support human reviewers to complete this coding task. Conclusion: Results provide strong evidence that text mining and machine learning procedures can be a cost-effective solution for extracting meaningful insights from text data. Although unsuitable for case-level predictive analytics, insights derived from these procedures can be particularly useful for investigating the prevalence, temporal trends, and geographic distribution of domestic violence-related needs in the child welfare system. These methods could substantially enhance the use of text data in social work research and evaluation. © 2021 Society for Social Work and Research.

Automatic Detection of Levels of Intimate Partner Violence Against Women with Natural Language Processing Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques,"Yallico Arias, T.; Fabian, J.","Violence against women continues to claim thousands of lives worldwide each year. The COVID-19 pandemic only aggravated the problem by confining many victims together with their aggressors. When a woman experiences this situation, she usually falls into denial, justifies the aggressive behavior of her partner, or even blames herself for provoking it. The sooner she realizes that she is experiencing intimate partner violence, she can act and prevent her advance in the violence cycle (from psychological violence to physical violence, which could lead to femicide). The work proposes a classifier artificial intelligence model to detect levels of psychological violence against women in written virtual expressions (messages ‘from him to her’ in a couple) to ‘alert her’ about the risk that she runs in that relationship. 5250 records in Spanish were extracted with 4 techniques from 6 different sources. Definition of 5 intimate partner psychological violence levels (0-Low Risk, 1-Emotional Blackmail, 2-Jealousy/Justification, 3-Insults/Humiliations, and 4-Threats/Possessiveness) and the data labeling were supervised by a psychologist expert on the problem. Techniques TF-IDF and Word2Vec were used to get the vectors and were tested five Machine Learning algorithms (SVM, MLP, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes) with various combinations of parameters. Too were tested pad sequences with LSTM and Bidirectional LSTM.

Characterizing shared and distinct symptom clusters in common chronic conditions through natural language processing of nursing notes,"Koleck, T.A.; Topaz, M.; Tatonetti, N.P.; George, M.; Miaskowski, C.; Smaldone, A.; Bakken, S.","Data-driven characterization of symptom clusters in chronic conditions is essential for shared cluster detection and physiological mechanism discovery. This study aims to computationally describe symptom documentation from electronic nursing notes and compare symptom clusters among patients diagnosed with four chronic conditions–chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and cancer. Nursing notes (N = 504,395; 133,977 patients) were obtained for the 2016 calendar year from a single medical center. We used NimbleMiner, a natural language processing application, to identify the presence of 56 symptoms. We calculated symptom documentation prevalence by note and patient for the corpus. Then, we visually compared documentation for a subset of patients (N = 22,657) diagnosed with COPD (n = 3339), heart failure (n = 6587), diabetes (n = 12,139), and cancer (n = 7269) and conducted multiple correspondence analysis and hierarchical clustering to discover underlying groups of patients who have similar symptom profiles (i.e., symptom clusters) for each condition. As expected, pain was the most frequently documented symptom. All conditions had a group of patients characterized by no symptoms. Shared clusters included cardiovascular symptoms for heart failure and diabetes; pain and other symptoms for COPD, diabetes, and cancer; and a newly-identified cognitive and neurological symptom cluster for heart failure, diabetes, and cancer. Cancer (gastrointestinal symptoms and fatigue) and COPD (mental health symptoms) each contained a unique cluster. In summary, we report both shared and distinct, as well as established and novel, symptom clusters across chronic conditions.

Does BERT Pay Attention to Cyberbullying?,"Elsafoury, F.; Katsigiannis, S.; Wilson, S.R.; Ramzan, N.","Social media have brought threats like cyberbullying, which can lead to stress, anxiety, depression, and in some severe cases, suicide attempts. Detecting cyberbullying can help to warn/ block bullies and provide support to victims. However, very few studies have used self-attention-based language models like BERT for cyberbullying detection and they typically only report BERT's performance without examining in depth the reasons for its performance. In this work, we examine the use of BERT for cyberbullying detection on various datasets and attempt to explain its performance by analyzing its attention weights and gradient-based feature importance scores for textual and linguistic features. Our results show that attention weights do not correlate with feature importance scores and thus do not explain the model's performance. Additionally, they suggest that BERT relies on syntactical biases in the datasets to assign feature importance scores to class-related wordsrather than cyberbullying-related linguistic features. © 2021 ACM.",2021,,SIGIR 2021 - Proceedings of the 44th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,,,1900-1904,,10.1145/3404835.3463029,,#1904,Elsafoury 2021,"",""
Bidirectional Representation Learning from Transformers Using Multimodal Electronic Health Record Data to Predict Depression,"Meng, Y.; Speier, W.; Ong, M.K.; Arnold, C.W.","Advancements in machine learning algorithms have had a beneficial impact on representation learning, classification, and prediction models built using electronic health record (EHR) data. Effort has been put both on increasing models' overall performance as well as improving their interpretability, particularly regarding the decision-making process. In this study, we present a temporal deep learning model to perform bidirectional representation learning on EHR sequences with a transformer architecture to predict future diagnosis of depression. This model is able to aggregate five heterogenous and high-dimensional data sources from the EHR and process them in a temporal manner for chronic disease prediction at various prediction windows. We applied the current trend of pretraining and fine-tuning on EHR data to outperform the current state-of-the-art in chronic disease prediction, and to demonstrate the underlying relation between EHR codes in the sequence. The model generated the highest increases of precision-recall area under the curve (PRAUC) from 0.70 to 0.76 in depression prediction compared to the best baseline model. Furthermore, the self-attention weights in each sequence quantitatively demonstrated the inner relationship between various codes, which improved the model's interpretability. These results demonstrate the model's ability to utilize heterogeneous EHR data to predict depression while achieving high accuracy and interpretability, which may facilitate constructing clinical decision support systems in the future for chronic disease screening and early detection.  © 2013 IEEE.",2021,,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,25,8,3121-3129,,10.1109/JBHI.2021.3063721,,#1906,Meng 2021,"",""
A natural language processing approach for identifying temporal disease onset information from mental healthcare text,"Viani, N.; Botelle, R.; Kerwin, J.; Yin, L.; Patel, R.; Stewart, R.; Velupillai, S.","Receiving timely and appropriate treatment is crucial for better health outcomes, and research on the contribution of specific variables is essential. In the mental health domain, an important research variable is the date of psychosis symptom onset, as longer delays in treatment are associated with worse intervention outcomes. The growing adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) within mental health services provides an invaluable opportunity to study this problem at scale retrospectively. However, disease onset information is often only available in open text fields, requiring natural language processing (NLP) techniques for automated analyses. Since this variable can be documented at different points during a patient’s care, NLP methods that model clinical and temporal associations are needed. We address the identification of psychosis onset by: 1) manually annotating a corpus of mental health EHRs with disease onset mentions, 2) modelling the underlying NLP problem as a paragraph classification approach, and 3) combining multiple onset paragraphs at the patient level to generate a ranked list of likely disease onset dates. For 22/31 test patients (71%) the correct onset date was found among the top-3 NLP predictions. The proposed approach was also applied at scale, allowing an onset date to be estimated for 2483 patients. © 2021, The Author(s).",2021,,Scientific Reports,11,1,,,10.1038/s41598-020-80457-0,,#1909,Viani 2021,"",""
Bias and fairness assessment of a natural language processing opioid misuse classifier: Detection and mitigation of electronic health record data disadvantages across racial subgroups,"Thompson, H.M.; Sharma, B.; Bhalla, S.; Boley, R.; McCluskey, C.; Dligach, D.; Churpek, M.M.; Karnik, N.S.; Afshar, M.","Objectives: To assess fairness and bias of a previously validated machine learning opioid misuse classifier. Materials & Methods: Two experiments were conducted with the classifier's original (n = 1000) and external validation (n = 53 974) datasets from 2 health systems. Bias was assessed via testing for differences in type II error rates across racial/ethnic subgroups (Black, Hispanic/Latinx, White, Other) using bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals. A local surrogate model was estimated to interpret the classifier's predictions by race and averaged globally from the datasets. Subgroup analyses and post-hoc recalibrations were conducted to attempt to mitigate biased metrics. Results: We identified bias in the false negative rate (FNR = 0.32) of the Black subgroup compared to the FNR (0.17) of the White subgroup. Top features included ""heroin""and ""substance abuse""across subgroups. Post-hoc recalibrations eliminated bias in FNR with minimal changes in other subgroup error metrics. The Black FNR subgroup had higher risk scores for readmission and mortality than the White FNR subgroup, and a higher mortality risk score than the Black true positive subgroup (P <. 05). Discussion: The Black FNR subgroup had the greatest severity of disease and risk for poor outcomes. Similar features were present between subgroups for predicting opioid misuse, but inequities were present. Post-hoc mitigation techniques mitigated bias in type II error rate without creating substantial type I error rates. From model design through deployment, bias and data disadvantages should be systematically addressed. Conclusion: Standardized, transparent bias assessments are needed to improve trustworthiness in clinical machine learning models.  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

Prevalence and temporal trends analysis of screening and diagnostic instruments in posttraumatic stress disorder: Text mining study,"Zong, H.; Hu, B.; Han, Y.; Li, Z.; Zhang, X.","Background: Various instruments for patient screening and diagnosis have been developed for and applied in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Objective: This study comprehensively investigates the prevalence and temporal trends of the most widely used instruments in PTSD-related studies. Methods: A total of 1345 files of registered clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov and 9422 abstracts from the PubMed database from 2005 to 2020 were downloaded for this study. The instruments applied in clinical trials were manually annotated, and instruments in abstracts were recognized using exact string matching. The prevalence score of an instrument in a certain period was calculated as the number of studies divided by the number of instances of the instrument. By calculating the yearly prevalence index of each instrument, we conducted a trends analysis and compared the trends in index change between instruments. Results: A total of 4178 instrument synonyms were annotated, which were mapped to 1423 unique instruments. In the 16 years from 2005 to 2020, only 10 instruments were used more than once per year; the 4 most used instruments were the PTSD Checklist, the Clinician-Administered PTSD Disorder Scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire, and the Beck Depression Inventory. There were 18 instruments whose yearly prevalence index score exceeded 0.1 at least once during the 16 years. The changes in trends and time points of partial instruments in clinical trials and PubMed abstracts were highly consistent. The average time duration of a PTSD-related trial was 1495.5 days or approximately 4 years from submission to ClinicalTrial.gov to publication in a journal. Conclusions: The application of widely accepted and appropriate instruments can help improve the reliability of research results in PTSD-related clinical studies.

A Data Science Approach to Estimating the Frequency of Driving Cessation Associated Suicide in the US: Evidence From the National Violent Death Reporting System,"Ko, T.M.; Kalesnikava, V.A.; Jurgens, D.; Mezuk, B.","Driving cessation is a common transition experienced by aging adults that confers both a symbolic and literal loss of independence due to the central role of automobiles for mobility in the US. Prior research has shown that driving cessation has negative implications for mental health, social participation, and access to healthcare. Given these sequelae of driving cessation and prior work showing that late-life transitions related to independence (e.g., transitioning into residential care) are associated with suicide, we sought to estimate the frequency of driving cessation associated suicide. Data include suicide (n = 59,080) and undetermined (n = 6,862) deaths aged ≥55 from the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS, 2003–2017). Each case in the NVDRS has both quantitative data (e.g., demographic characteristics) and qualitative text narratives, derived from coroner/medical examiner reports, which describe the most salient circumstances and features of each death. To identify cases associated with driving cessation, we employed a supervised random forest algorithm to develop a Natural Language Processing (NLP) classifier. Identified driving cessation associated cases were then categorized and characterized using descriptive statistics and qualitative content analysis. From 2003 to 2017, there were an estimated 305 cases of suicide/undetermined deaths associated with driving cessation in the NVDRS, representing 0.04% of all cases. Cases associated with driving cessation were older, more likely to be male, more likely to have a physical health problem, more likely to have experienced a recent crisis, and more likely to have lived in a rural county than other decedents. Qualitative analysis identified functional impairment, alcohol-related driving limitations, loss of employment, and recent car accidents as common themes among cases associated with driving cessation. This analysis illustrates the utility of NLP in identifying novel correlates of suicide in later life. Although driving cessation associated suicide is a rare outcome, further research is warranted on understanding the conditions under which driving cessation is associated with suicidal behavior, and how to support the well-being of aging adults during these types of major life transitions. © Copyright © 2021 Ko, Kalesnikava, Jurgens and Mezuk.",2021,,Frontiers in Public Health,9,,,,10.3389/fpubh.2021.689967,,#1916,Ko 2021,"",""
Text classification models for the automatic detection of nonmedical prescription medication use from social media,"Al-Garadi, M.A.; Yang, Y.-C.; Cai, H.; Ruan, Y.; O’Connor, K.; Graciela, G.-H.; Perrone, J.; Sarker, A.","Background: Prescription medication (PM) misuse/abuse has emerged as a national crisis in the United States, and social media has been suggested as a potential resource for performing active monitoring. However, automating a social media-based monitoring system is challenging—requiring advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning methods. In this paper, we describe the development and evaluation of automatic text classification models for detecting self-reports of PM abuse from Twitter. Methods: We experimented with state-of-the-art bi-directional transformer-based language models, which utilize tweet-level representations that enable transfer learning (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, AlBERT, and DistilBERT), proposed fusion-based approaches, and compared the developed models with several traditional machine learning, including deep learning, approaches. Using a public dataset, we evaluated the performances of the classifiers on their abilities to classify the non-majority “abuse/misuse” class. Results: Our proposed fusion-based model performs significantly better than the best traditional model (F1-score [95% CI]: 0.67 [0.64–0.69] vs. 0.45 [0.42–0.48]). We illustrate, via experimentation using varying training set sizes, that the transformer-based models are more stable and require less annotated data compared to the other models. The significant improvements achieved by our best-performing classification model over past approaches makes it suitable for automated continuous monitoring of nonmedical PM use from Twitter. Conclusions: BERT, BERT-like and fusion-based models outperform traditional machine learning and deep learning models, achieving substantial improvements over many years of past research on the topic of prescription medication misuse/abuse classification from social media, which had been shown to be a complex task due to the unique ways in which information about nonmedical use is presented.

Topic and sentiment analysis were used to derive the key variables—the topic of posts that the users care about most, and the emotion scores contained in posts. We then constructed a theoretical model based on the information adoption model. As core independent variables of information quality, on online mental health communities, the topic of social experience in posts (0.368 ***), the topic of emotional expression (0.353 ***), and the sentiment contained in the text (0.002 *) all had significant positive relationships with the number of likes and reposts. This study found that the users of online mental health communities are more attentive to the topics of social experience and emotional expressions, while they also care about the non-linguistic information. This study highlights the importance of helping community users to post on community-related topics, and gives administrators possible ways to help users gain the communication and support they need. © 2021 by the authors.

Characterisation of covid-19-related tweets in the croatian language: Framework based on the cro-cov-csebert model,"Babić, K.; Petrović, M.; Beliga, S.; Martinčić-Ipšić, S.; Matešić, M.; Meštrović, A.","This study aims to provide insights into the COVID-19-related communication on Twitter in the Republic of Croatia. For that purpose, we developed an NL-based framework that enables automatic analysis of a large dataset of tweets in the Croatian language. We collected and analysed 206,196 tweets related to COVID-19 and constructed a dataset of 10,000 tweets which we manually annotated with a sentiment label. We trained the Cro-CoV-cseBERT language model for the representation and clustering of tweets. Additionally, we compared the performance of four machine learning algorithms on the task of sentiment classification. After identifying the best performing setup of NLP methods, we applied the proposed framework in the task of characterisation of COVID-19 tweets in Croatia. More precisely, we performed sentiment analysis and tracked the sentiment over time. Furthermore, we detected how tweets are grouped into clusters with similar themes across three pandemic waves. Additionally, we characterised the tweets by analysing the distribution of sentiment polarity (in each thematic cluster and over time) and the number of retweets (in each thematic cluster and sentiment class). These results could be useful for additional research and interpretation in the domains of sociology, psychology or other sciences, as well as for the authorities, who could use them to address crisis communication problems. © 2021 by the authors.

Automatic identification of suicide notes with a transformer-based deep learning model,"Zhang, T.; Schoene, A.M.; Ananiadou, S.","Suicide is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. At the same time, the widespread use of social media has led to an increase in people posting their suicide notes online. Therefore, designing a learning model that can aid the detection of suicide notes online is of great importance. However, current methods cannot capture both local and global semantic features. In this paper, we propose a transformer-based model named TransformerRNN, which can effectively extract contextual and long-term dependency information by using a transformer encoder and a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) structure. We evaluate our model with baseline approaches on a dataset collected from online sources (including 659 suicide notes, 431 last statements, and 2000 neutral posts). Our proposed TransformerRNN achieves 95.0%, 94.9% and 94.9% performance in P, R and F1-score metrics respectively and therefore outperforms comparable machine learning and state-of-the-art deep learning models. The proposed model is effective for classifying suicide notes, which in turn, may help to develop suicide prevention technologies for social media. © 2021",2021,,Internet Interventions,25,,,,10.1016/j.invent.2021.100422,,#1925,Zhang 2021,"",""
Determinants of shielding behavior during the covid-19 pandemic and associations with well-being among national health service patients: Longitudinal observational study,"Bachtiger, P.; Adamson, A.; MacLean, W.A.; Kelshiker, M.A.; Quint, J.K.; Peters, N.S.","Background: The UK National Health Service (NHS) classified 2.2 million people as clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) during the first wave of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, advising them to ""shield"" (to not leave home for any reason). Objective: The aim of this study was to measure the determinants of shielding behavior and associations with well-being in a large NHS patient population for informing future health policy. Methods: Patients contributing to an ongoing longitudinal participatory epidemiology study (Longitudinal Effects on Wellbeing of the COVID-19 Pandemic [LoC-19], n=42,924) received weekly email invitations to complete questionnaires (17-week shielding period starting April 9, 2020) within their NHS personal electronic health record. Question items focused on well-being. Participants were stratified into four groups by self-reported CEV status (qualifying condition) and adoption of shielding behavior (baselined at week 1 or 2). The distribution of CEV criteria was reported alongside situational variables and univariable and multivariable logistic regression. Longitudinal trends in physical and mental well-being were displayed graphically. Free-text responses reporting variables impacting well-being were semiquantified using natural language processing. In the lead up to a second national lockdown (October 23, 2020), a follow-up questionnaire evaluated subjective concern if further shielding was advised. Results: The study included 7240 participants. In the CEV group (n=2391), 1133 (47.3%) assumed shielding behavior at baseline, compared with 633 (13.0%) in the non-CEV group (n=4849). CEV participants who shielded were more likely to be Asian (odds ratio [OR] 2.02, 95% CI 1.49-2.76), female (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.05-1.45), older (OR per year increase 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.02), living in a home with an outdoor space (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.06-1.70) or three to four other inhabitants (three: OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.15-1.94; four: OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.10-2.01), or solid organ transplant recipients (OR 2.85, 95% CI 2.18-3.77), or have severe chronic lung disease (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.30-2.04). Receipt of a government letter advising shielding was reported in 1115 (46.6%) CEV participants and 180 (3.7%) non-CEV participants, and was associated with adopting shielding behavior (OR 3.34, 95% CI 2.82-3.95 and OR 2.88, 95% CI 2.04-3.99, respectively). In CEV participants, shielding at baseline was associated with a lower rating of mental well-being and physical well-being. Similar results were found for non-CEV participants. Concern for well-being if future shielding was required was most prevalent among CEV participants who had originally shielded. Conclusions: Future health policy must balance the potential protection from COVID-19 against our findings that shielding negatively impacted well-being and was adopted in many in whom it was not indicated and variably in whom it was indicated. This therefore also requires clearer public health messaging and support for well-being if shielding is to be advised in future pandemic scenarios. © Patrik Bachtiger, Alexander Adamson, William A Maclean, Mihir A Kelshiker, Jennifer K Quint, Nicholas S Peters.",2021,,JMIR Public Health and Surveillance,7,9,,,10.2196/30460,,#1930,Bachtiger 2021,"",""
Estimation of psychological distress in Japanese youth through narrative writing: Text-based stylometric and sentiment analyses,"Manabe, M.; Liew, K.; Yada, S.; Wakamiya, S.; Aramaki, E.","Background: Internalizing mental illnesses associated with psychological distress are often underdetected. Text-based detection using natural language processing (NLP) methods is increasingly being used to complement conventional detection efforts. However, these approaches often rely on self-disclosure through autobiographical narratives that may not always be possible, especially in the context of the collectivistic Japanese culture. Objective: We propose the use of narrative writing as an alternative resource for mental illness detection in youth. Accordingly, in this study, we investigated the textual characteristics of narratives written by youth with psychological distress; our research focuses on the detection of psychopathological tendencies in written imaginative narratives. Methods: Using NLP tools such as stylometric measures and lexicon-based sentiment analysis, we examined short narratives from 52 Japanese youth (mean age 19.8 years, SD 3.1) obtained through crowdsourcing. Participants wrote a short narrative introduction to an imagined story before completing a questionnaire to quantify their tendencies toward psychological distress. Based on this score, participants were categorized into higher distress and lower distress groups. The written narratives were then analyzed using NLP tools and examined for between-group differences. Although outside the scope of this study, we also carried out a supplementary analysis of narratives written by adults using the same procedure. Results: Youth demonstrating higher tendencies toward psychological distress used significantly more positive (happiness-related) words, revealing differences in valence of the narrative content. No other significant differences were observed between the high and low distress groups. Conclusions: Youth with tendencies toward mental illness were found to write more positive stories that contained more happiness-related terms. These results may potentially have widespread implications on psychological distress screening on online platforms, particularly in cultures such as Japan that are not accustomed to self-disclosure. Although the mechanisms that we propose in explaining our results are speculative, we believe that this interpretation paves the way for future research in online surveillance and detection efforts. ©Masae Manabe, Kongmeng Liew, Shuntaro Yada, Shoko Wakamiya, Eiji Aramaki.",2021,,JMIR Formative Research,5,8,,,10.2196/29500,,#1932,Manabe 2021,"",""
Applying Attention-Based Models for Detecting Cognitive Processes and Mental Health Conditions,"Villatoro-Tello, E.; Parida, S.; Kumar, S.; Motlicek, P.","According to the psychological literature, implicit motives allow for the characterization of behavior, subsequent success, and long-term development. Contrary to personality traits, implicit motives are often deemed to be rather stable personality characteristics. Normally, implicit motives are obtained by Operant Motives, unconscious intrinsic desires measured by the Operant Motive Test (OMT). The OMT test requires participants to write freely descriptions associated with a set of provided images and questions. In this work, we explore different recent machine learning techniques and various text representation techniques for facing the problem of the OMT classification task. We focused on advanced language representations (e.g, BERT, XLM, and DistilBERT) and deep Supervised Autoencoders for solving the OMT task. We performed an exhaustive analysis and compared their performance against fully connected neural networks and traditional support vector classifiers. Our comparative study highlights the importance of BERT which outperforms the traditional machine learning techniques by a relative improvement of 7.9%. In addition, we performed an analysis of how the BERT attention mechanism is being modified. Our findings indicate that the writing style features acquire higher importance at the moment of accurately identifying the different OMT categories. This is the first time that a study to determine the performance of different transformer-based architectures in the OMT task is performed. Similarly, our work propose, for the first time, using deep supervised autoencoders in the OMT classification task. Our experiments demonstrate that transformer-based methods exhibit the best empirical results, obtaining a relative improvement of 7.9% over the competitive baseline suggested as part of the GermEval 2020 challenge. Additionally, we show that features associated with the writing style are more important than content-based words. Some of these findings show strong connections to previously reported behavioral research on the implicit psychometrics theory. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2021,,Cognitive Computation,13,5,1154-1171,,10.1007/s12559-021-09901-1,,#1933,Villatoro-Tello 2021,"",""

Developing a Natural Language Processing tool to identify perinatal self-harm in electronic healthcare records,"Ayre, K.; Bittar, A.; Kam, J.; Verma, S.; Howard, L.M.; Dutta, R.","Background Self-harm occurring within pregnancy and the postnatal year (“perinatal self-harm”) is a clinically important yet under-researched topic. Current research likely under-estimates prevalence due to methodological limitations. Electronic healthcare records (EHRs) provide a source of clinically rich data on perinatal self-harm. Aims (1) To create a Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool that can, with acceptable precision and recall, identify mentions of acts of perinatal self-harm within EHRs. (2) To use this tool to identify service-users who have self-harmed perinatally, based on their EHRs. Methods We used the Clinical Record Interactive Search system to extract de-identified EHRs of secondary mental healthcare service-users at South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust. We developed a tool that applied several layers of linguistic processing based on the spaCy NLP library for Python. We evaluated mention-level performance in the following domains: span, status, temporality and polarity. Evaluation was done against a manually coded reference standard. Mention-level performance was reported as precision, recall, F-score and Cohen’s kappa for each domain. Performance was also assessed at ‘service-user’ level and explored whether a heuristic rule improved this. We report per-class statistics for service-user performance, as well as likelihood ratios and post-test probabilities. Results Mention-level performance: micro-averaged F-score, precision and recall for span, polarity and temporality >0.8. Kappa for status 0.68, temporality 0.62, polarity 0.91. Service-user level performance with heuristic: F-score, precision, recall of minority class 0.69, macro-averaged F-score 0.81, positive LR 9.4 (4.8–19), post-test probability 69.0% (53–82%). Considering the task difficulty, the tool performs well, although temporality was the attribute with the lowest level of annotator agreement. Conclusions It is feasible to develop an NLP tool that identifies, with acceptable validity, mentions of perinatal self-harm within EHRs, although with limitations regarding temporality. Using a heuristic rule, it can also function at a service-user-level. © 2021 Public Library of Science.

Association of depression symptom severity with short-term risk of an initial hospital encounter in adults with major depressive disorder,"Voelker, J.; Wang, K.; Tang, W.; He, J.; Daly, E.; Pericone, C.D.; Sheehan, J.J.","Background: Despite the availability of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment options, depression continues to be one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. This study evaluated whether depression symptom severity, as measured by PHQ-9 score, of patients diagnosed with MDD is associated with short-term risk of a hospital encounter (ER visit or inpatient stay). Methods: Adults with ≥1 PHQ-9 assessment in an outpatient setting (index date) and ≥ 1 MDD diagnosis within 6 months prior were included from the de-identified Optum Electronic Health Record database (April 2016–June 2019). Patients were categorized by depression symptom severity based on PHQ-9 scores obtained by natural language processing. Crude rates, adjusted absolute risks, and adjusted relative risks of all-cause and MDD-related hospital encounters within 30 days following assessment of depression severity were determined. Results: The study population consisted of 280,145 patients with MDD and ≥ 1 PHQ-9 assessment in an outpatient setting. Based on PHQ-9 scores, 26.9% of patients were categorized as having none/minimal depression symptom severity, 16.4% as mild, 24.7% as moderate, 19.6% as moderately severe, and 12.5% as severe. Among patients with none/minimal, mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, the adjusted absolute short-term risks of an initial all-cause hospital encounter were 4.1, 4.4, 4.8, 5.6, and 6.5%, respectively; MDD-related hospital encounter adjusted absolute risks were 0.8, 1.0, 1.3, 1.6, and 2.1%, respectively. Compared to patients with none/minimal depression symptom severity, the adjusted relative risks of an all-cause hospital encounter were 1.60 (95% CI 1.50–1.70) for those with severe, 1.36 (1.29–1.44) for those with moderately severe, 1.18 (1.12–1.25) for those with moderate, and 1.07 (1.00–1.13) for those with mild depression symptom severity. Conclusions: These study findings indicate that depression symptom severity is a key driver of short-term risk of hospital encounters, emphasizing the need for timely interventions that can ameliorate depression symptom severity. © 2021, The Author(s).",2021,,BMC Psychiatry,21,1,,,10.1186/s12888-021-03258-3,,#1938,Voelker 2021,"",""
A pipeline to understand emerging illness via social media data analysis: Case study on breast implant illness,"Dey, V.; Krasniak, P.; Nguyen, M.; Lee, C.; Ning, X.","Background: A new illness can come to public attention through social media before it is medically defined, formally documented, or systematically studied. One example is a condition known as breast implant illness (BII), which has been extensively discussed on social media, although it is vaguely defined in the medical literature. Objective: The objective of this study is to construct a data analysis pipeline to understand emerging illnesses using social media data and to apply the pipeline to understand the key attributes of BII. Methods: We constructed a pipeline of social media data analysis using natural language processing and topic modeling. Mentions related to signs, symptoms, diseases, disorders, and medical procedures were extracted from social media data using the clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System. We mapped the mentions to standard medical concepts and then summarized these mapped concepts as topics using latent Dirichlet allocation. Finally, we applied this pipeline to understand BII from several BII-dedicated social media sites. Results: Our pipeline identified topics related to toxicity, cancer, and mental health issues that were highly associated with BII. Our pipeline also showed that cancers, autoimmune disorders, and mental health problems were emerging concerns associated with breast implants, based on social media discussions. Furthermore, the pipeline identified mentions such as rupture, infection, pain, and fatigue as common self-reported issues among the public, as well as concerns about toxicity from silicone implants. Conclusions: Our study could inspire future studies on the suggested symptoms and factors of BII. Our study provides the first analysis and derived knowledge of BII from social media using natural language processing techniques and demonstrates the potential of using social media information to better understand similar emerging illnesses. ©Vishal Dey, Peter Krasniak, Minh Nguyen, Clara Lee, Xia Ning.",2021,,JMIR Medical Informatics,9,11,,,10.2196/29768,,#1941,Dey 2021,"",""
Natural language processing for cognitive therapy: Extracting schemas from thought records,"Burger, F.; Neerincx, M.A.; Brinkman, W.-P.","The cognitive approach to psychotherapy aims to change patients' maladaptive schemas, that is, overly negative views on themselves, the world, or the future. To obtain awareness of these views, they record their thought processes in situations that caused pathogenic emotional responses. The schemas underlying such thought records have, thus far, been largely manually identified. Using recent advances in natural language processing, we take this one step further by automatically extracting schemas from thought records. To this end, we asked 320 healthy participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk to each complete five thought records consisting of several utterances reflecting cognitive processes. Agreement between two raters on manually scoring the utterances with respect to how much they reflect each schema was substantial (Cohen's κ = 0.79). Natural language processing software pretrained on all English Wikipedia articles from 2014 (GLoVE embeddings) was used to represent words and utterances, which were then mapped to schemas using k-nearest neighbors algorithms, support vector machines, and recurrent neural networks. For the more frequently occurring schemas, all algorithms were able to leverage linguistic patterns. For example, the scores assigned to the Competence schema by the algorithms correlated with the manually assigned scores with Spearman correlations ranging between 0.64 and 0.76. For six of the nine schemas, a set of recurrent neural networks trained separately for each of the schemas outperformed the other algorithms. We present our results here as a benchmark solution, since we conducted this research to explore the possibility of automatically processing qualitative mental health data and did not aim to achieve optimal performance with any of the explored models. The dataset of 1600 thought records comprising 5747 utterances is published together with this article for researchers and machine learning enthusiasts to improve upon our outcomes. Based on our promising results, we see further opportunities for using free-text input and subsequent natural language processing in other common therapeutic tools, such as ecological momentary assessments, automated case conceptualizations, and, more generally, as an alternative to mental health scales.

Automated Monitoring of Suicidal Adolescents' Digital Media Use: Qualitative Study Exploring Acceptability within Clinical Care,"Biernesser, C.; Zelazny, J.; Brent, D.; Bear, T.; Mair, C.; Trauth, J.","Background: Monitoring linguistic cues from adolescents' digital media use (DMU; ie, digital content transmitted on the web, such as through text messages or social media) that could denote suicidal risk offers a unique opportunity to protect adolescents vulnerable to suicide, the second leading cause of death among youth. Adolescents communicate through digital media in high volumes and frequently express emotionality. In fact, web-based disclosures of suicidality are more common than in-person disclosures. The use of automated methods of digital media monitoring triggered by a natural language processing algorithm offers the potential to detect suicidal risk from subtle linguistic units (eg, negatively valanced words, phrases, or emoticons known to be associated with suicidality) present within adolescents' digital media content and to use this information to respond to alerts of suicidal risk. Critical to the implementation of such an approach is the consideration of its acceptability in the clinical care of adolescents at high risk of suicide. Objective: Through data collection among recently suicidal adolescents, parents, and clinicians, this study examines the current context of digital media monitoring for suicidal adolescents seeking clinical care to inform the need for automated monitoring and the factors that influence the acceptance of automated monitoring of suicidal adolescents'DMU within clinical care. Methods: A total of 15 recently suicidal adolescents (aged 13-17 years), 12 parents, and 10 clinicians participated in focus groups, qualitative interviews, and a group discussion, respectively. Data were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Participants described important challenges to the current strategies for monitoring the DMU of suicidal youth. They felt that automated monitoring would have advantages over current monitoring approaches, namely, by protecting web-based environments and aiding adolescent disclosure and support seeking about web-based suicidal risk communication, which may otherwise go unnoticed. However, they identified barriers that could impede implementation within clinical care, namely, adolescents' and parents' concerns about unintended consequences of automated monitoring, that is, the potential for loss of privacy or false alerts, and clinicians' concerns about liability to respond to alerts of suicidal risk. On the basis of the needs and preferences of adolescents, parents, and clinicians, a model for automated digital media monitoring is presented that aims to optimize acceptability within clinical care for suicidal youth. Conclusions: Automated digital media monitoring offers a promising means to augment detection and response to suicidal risk within the clinical care of suicidal youth when strategies that address the preferences of adolescents, parents, and clinicians are in place. © 2021 JMIR Publications Inc.

Acoustic and language analysis of speech for suicidal ideation among US veterans,"Belouali, A.; Gupta, S.; Sourirajan, V.; Yu, J.; Allen, N.; Alaoui, A.; Dutton, M.A.; Reinhard, M.J.","Background: Screening for suicidal ideation in high-risk groups such as U.S. veterans is crucial for early detection and suicide prevention. Currently, screening is based on clinical interviews or self-report measures. Both approaches rely on subjects to disclose their suicidal thoughts. Innovative approaches are necessary to develop objective and clinically applicable assessments. Speech has been investigated as an objective marker to understand various mental states including suicidal ideation. In this work, we developed a machine learning and natural language processing classifier based on speech markers to screen for suicidal ideation in US veterans. Methodology: Veterans submitted 588 narrative audio recordings via a mobile app in a real-life setting. In addition, participants completed self-report psychiatric scales and questionnaires. Recordings were analyzed to extract voice characteristics including prosodic, phonation, and glottal. The audios were also transcribed to extract textual features for linguistic analysis. We evaluated the acoustic and linguistic features using both statistical significance and ensemble feature selection. We also examined the performance of different machine learning algorithms on multiple combinations of features to classify suicidal and non-suicidal audios. Results: A combined set of 15 acoustic and linguistic features of speech were identified by the ensemble feature selection. Random Forest classifier, using the selected set of features, correctly identified suicidal ideation in veterans with 86% sensitivity, 70% specificity, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 80%.

Deep learning with anaphora resolution for the detection of tweeters with depression: Algorithm development and validation study,"Wongkoblap, A.; Vadillo, M.A.; Curcin, V.","Background: Mental health problems are widely recognized as a major public health challenge worldwide. This concern highlights the need to develop effective tools for detecting mental health disorders in the population. Social networks are a promising source of data wherein patients publish rich personal information that can be mined to extract valuable psychological cues; however, these data come with their own set of challenges, such as the need to disambiguate between statements about oneself and third parties. Traditionally, natural language processing techniques for social media have looked at text classifiers and user classification models separately, hence presenting a challenge for researchers who want to combine text sentiment and user sentiment analysis. Objective: The objective of this study is to develop a predictive model that can detect users with depression from Twitter posts and instantly identify textual content associated with mental health topics. The model can also address the problem of anaphoric resolution and highlight anaphoric interpretations. Methods: We retrieved the data set from Twitter by using a regular expression or stream of real-time tweets comprising 3682 users, of which 1983 self-declared their depression and 1699 declared no depression. Two multiple instance learning models were developed—one with and one without an anaphoric resolution encoder—to identify users with depression and highlight posts related to the mental health of the author. Several previously published models were applied to our data set, and their performance was compared with that of our models. Results: The maximum accuracy, F1 score, and area under the curve of our anaphoric resolution model were 92%, 92%, and 90%, respectively. The model outperformed alternative predictive models, which ranged from classical machine learning models to deep learning models. Conclusions: Our model with anaphoric resolution shows promising results when compared with other predictive models and provides valuable insights into textual content that is relevant to the mental health of the tweeter. © Akkapon Wongkoblap, Miguel A Vadillo, Vasa Curcin.",2021,,JMIR Mental Health,8,8,,,10.2196/19824,,#1949,Wongkoblap 2021,"",""
You made me feel this way: Investigating Partners' Influence in Predicting Emotions in Couples' Conflict Interactions using Speech Data,"Boateng, G.; Hilpert, P.; Bodenmann, G.; Neysari, M.; Kowatsch, T.","How romantic partners interact with each other during a conflict influences how they feel at the end of the interaction and is predictive of whether the partners stay together in the long term. Hence understanding the emotions of each partner is important. Yet current approaches that are used include self-reports which are burdensome and hence limit the frequency of this data collection. Automatic emotion prediction could address this challenge. Insights from psychology research indicate that partners' behaviors influence each other's emotions in conflict interaction and hence, the behavior of both partners could be considered to better predict each partner's emotion. However, it is yet to be investigated how doing so compares to only using each partner's own behavior in terms of emotion prediction performance. In this work, we used BERT to extract linguistic features (i.e., what partners said) and openSMILE to extract paralinguistic features (i.e., how they said it) from a data set of 368 German-speaking Swiss couples (N = 736 individuals) who were videotaped during an 8-minutes conflict interaction in the laboratory. Based on those features, we trained machine learning models to predict if partners feel positive or negative after the conflict interaction. Our results show that including the behavior of the other partner improves the prediction performance. Furthermore, for men, considering how their female partners spoke is most important and for women considering what their male partner said is most important in getting better prediction performance. This work is a step towards automatically recognizing each partners' emotion based on the behavior of both, which would enable a better understanding of couples in research, therapy, and the real world.  © 2021 ACM.",2021,,ICMI 2021 Companion - Companion Publication of the 2021 International Conference on Multimodal Interaction,,,390-394,,10.1145/3461615.3485424,,#1951,Boateng 2021,"",""

Four main stages were found during the pandemic according to the changes in the online PHS population: sharp growth, significant decline, slight rebound, and slow decline. This study identified large-scale, spontaneous PHS behaviors among the online public during the COVID-19 pandemic and the various psychological problems and influential factors that varied across different stages of the pandemic, suggesting that the government and health practitioners should adopt effective policies and strategies to prevent and intervene in mental health problems for the online public. © 2021 by the authors.

Leveraging Text Mining Approach to Identify What People Want to Know About Mental Disorders From Online Inquiry Platforms,"Park, S.; Kim-Knauss, Y.; Sim, J.-A.","Online inquiry platforms, which is where a person can anonymously ask questions, have become an important information source for those who are concerned about social stigma and discrimination that follow mental disorders. Therefore, examining what people inquire about regarding mental disorders would be useful when designing educational programs for communities. The present study aimed to examine the contents of the queries regarding mental disorders that were posted on online inquiry platforms. A total of 4,714 relevant queries from the two major online inquiry platforms were collected. We computed word frequencies, centralities, and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling. The words like symptom, hospital and treatment ranked as the most frequently used words, and the word my appeared to have the highest centrality. LDA identified four latent topics: (1) the understanding of general symptoms, (2) a disability grading system and welfare entitlement, (3) stressful life events, and (4) social adaptation with mental disorders. People are interested in practical information concerning mental disorders, such as social benefits, social adaptation, more general information about the symptoms and the treatments. Our findings suggest that instructions encompassing different scopes of information are needed when developing educational programs. © Copyright © 2021 Park, Kim-Knauss and Sim.",2021,,Frontiers in Public Health,9,,,,10.3389/fpubh.2021.759802,,#1966,Park 2021,"",""
How do you feel? Using natural language processing to automatically rate emotion in psychotherapy,"Tanana, M.J.; Soma, C.S.; Kuo, P.B.; Bertagnolli, N.M.; Dembe, A.; Pace, B.T.; Srikumar, V.; Atkins, D.C.; Imel, Z.E.","Emotional distress is a common reason for seeking psychotherapy, and sharing emotional material is central to the process of psychotherapy. However, systematic research examining patterns of emotional exchange that occur during psychotherapy sessions is often limited in scale. Traditional methods for identifying emotion in psychotherapy rely on labor-intensive observer ratings, client or therapist ratings obtained before or after sessions, or involve manually extracting ratings of emotion from session transcripts using dictionaries of positive and negative words that do not take the context of a sentence into account. However, recent advances in technology in the area of machine learning algorithms, in particular natural language processing, have made it possible for mental health researchers to identify sentiment, or emotion, in therapist–client interactions on a large scale that would be unattainable with more traditional methods. As an attempt to extend prior findings from Tanana et al. (2016), we compared their previous sentiment model with a common dictionary-based psychotherapy model, LIWC, and a new NLP model, BERT. We used the human ratings from a database of 97,497 utterances from psychotherapy to train the BERT model.

Aspect-based sentiment analysis with graph convolution over syntactic dependencies,"Žunić, A.; Corcoran, P.; Spasić, I.","Aspect-based sentiment analysis is a natural language processing task whose aim is to automatically classify the sentiment associated with a specific aspect of a written text. In this study, we propose a novel model for aspect-based sentiment analysis, which exploits the dependency parse tree of a sentence using graph convolution to classify the sentiment of a given aspect. To evaluate this model in the domain of health and well-being, where this task is biased toward negative sentiment, we used a corpus of drug reviews. Specific aspects were grounded in the Unified Medical Language System, a large repository of inter-related biomedical concepts and the corresponding terminology. Our experiments demonstrated that graph convolution approach outperforms standard deep learning architectures on the task of aspect-based sentiment analysis. Moreover, graph convolution over dependency parse trees (F-score of 0.8179) outperforms the same approach over a flat sequence representation of sentences (F-score of 0.7332).

"Trends in reasons for emergency calls during the COVID-19 crisis in the department of Gironde, France using artificial neural network for natural language classification","Gil-Jardiné, C.; Chenais, G.; Pradeau, C.; Tentillier, E.; Revel, P.; Combes, X.; Galinski, M.; Tellier, E.; Lagarde, E.","Objectives: During periods such as the COVID-19 crisis, there is a need for responsive public health surveillance indicators in order to monitor both the epidemic growth and potential public health consequences of preventative measures such as lockdown. We assessed whether the automatic classification of the content of calls to emergency medical communication centers could provide relevant and responsive indicators. Methods: We retrieved all 796,209 free-text call reports from the emergency medical communication center of the Gironde department, France, between 2018 and 2020. We trained a natural language processing neural network model with a mixed unsupervised/supervised method to classify all reasons for calls in 2020. Validation and parameter adjustment were performed using a sample of 39,907 manually-coded free-text reports. Results: The number of daily calls for flu-like symptoms began to increase from February 21, 2020 and reached an unprecedented level by February 28, 2020 and peaked on March 14, 2020, 3 days before lockdown. It was strongly correlated with daily emergency room admissions, with a delay of 14 days. Calls for chest pain and stress and anxiety, peaked 12 days later. Calls for malaises with loss of consciousness, non-voluntary injuries and alcohol intoxications sharply decreased, starting one month before lockdown. No noticeable trends in relation to lockdown was found for other groups of reasons including gastroenteritis and abdominal pain, stroke, suicide and self-harm, pregnancy and delivery problems. Discussion: The first wave of the COVID-19 crisis came along with increased levels of stress and anxiety but no increase in alcohol intoxication and violence. As expected, call related to road traffic crashes sharply decreased. The sharp decrease in the number of calls for malaise was more surprising. Conclusion: The content of calls to emergency medical communication centers is an efficient epidemiological surveillance data source that provides insights into the societal upheavals induced by a health crisis. The use of an automatic classification system using artificial intelligence makes it possible to free itself from the context that could influence a human coder, especially in a crisis situation.

Nowadays, social media platforms are being used for emotional self-expression towards current events, including the COVID-19 pandemic. The study of people’s emotions in social media is vital to understand the effect of this pandemic on mental health, in order to protect societies. This work aims to investigate to what extent deep learning models can assist in understanding society’s attitude in social media toward COVID-19 pandemic. We employ two transformer-based models for fine-grained sentiment detection of Arabic tweets, considering that more than one emotion can co-exist in the same tweet. We also show how the textual representation of emojis can boost the performance of sentiment analysis. In addition, we propose a dynamically weighted loss function (DWLF) to handle the issue of imbalanced datasets. The proposed approach has been evaluated on two datasets and the attained results demonstrate that the proposed BERT-based models with emojis replacement and DWLF technique can improve the sentiment detection of multi-dialect Arabic tweets with an F1-Micro score of 0.72. © 2021 by the authors.

Utilizing natural language processing in case-based reasoning for diagnosing and managing schizophrenia disorder,"Mulyana, S.; Hartati, S.; Wardoyo, R.","Some methods have been developed to help diagnose mental disorders and provide treatment. These methods are developed as an alternative to solve the problems of imbalance between mental health services and the number of psychiatrists/psychologists, for example, CBR systems, and expert systems. In most health services, the initial examination of patients with mental disorders is performed by non-specialist medical personnel. At a certain stage when the patient is unable to express the symptoms, the examining officer is required to state the conditions in daily language. Based on this condition, the paramedics will carry out the next diagnosis. In handling of case-based reasoning assisted diagnoses, the use of natural language as an expression of the patient’s condition is not an input commonly used in the system. Hence that the natural language processing model becomes symptoms is needed. In this research, natural language processing was developed to produce symptoms according to the patient’s condition.

"Applying and Understanding an Advanced, Novel Deep Learning Approach: A Covid 19, Text Based, Emotions Analysis Study","Choudrie, J.; Patil, S.; Kotecha, K.; Matta, N.; Pappas, I.","The pandemic COVID 19 has altered individuals’ daily lives across the globe. It has led to preventive measures such as physical distancing to be imposed on individuals and led to terms such as ‘lockdown,’ ‘emergency,’ or curfew’ to emerge in various countries. It has affected society, not only physically and financially, but in terms of emotional wellbeing as well. This distress in the human emotional quotient results from multiple factors such as financial implications, family member’s behavior and support, country-specific lockdown protocols, media influence, or fear of the pandemic. For efficient pandemic management, there is a need to understand the emotional variations among individuals, as this will provide insights into public sentiment towards various government pandemic management policies. From our investigations, it was found that individuals have increasingly used different microblogging platforms such as Twitter to remain connected and express their feelings and concerns during the pandemic. However, research in the area of expressed emotional wellbeing during COVID 19 is still growing, which motivated this team to form the aim: To identify, explore and understand globally the emotions expressed during the earlier months of the pandemic COVID 19 by utilizing Deep Learning and Natural language Processing (NLP). For the data collection, over 2 million tweets during February–June 2020 were collected and analyzed using an advanced deep learning technique of Transfer Learning and Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa). A Reddit-based standard Emotion Dataset by Crowdflower was utilized for transfer learning. Using RoBERTa and the collated Twitter dataset, a multi-class emotion classifier system was formed. With the implemented methodology, a tweet classification accuracy of 80.33% and an average MCC score of 0.78 was achieved, improving the existing AI-based emotion classification methods. This study explains the novel application of the Roberta model during the pandemic that provided insights into changing emotional wellbeing over time of various citizens worldwide.

Measuring diagnostic heterogeneity using text-mining of the lived experiences of patients,"Ghosh, C.C.; McVicar, D.; Davidson, G.; Shannon, C.","Background: The diagnostic system is fundamental to any health discipline, including mental health, as it defines mental illness and helps inform possible treatment and prognosis. Thus, the procedure to estimate the reliability of such a system is of utmost importance. The current ways of measuring the reliability of the diagnostic system have limitations. In this study, we propose an alternative approach for verifying and measuring the reliability of the existing system. Methods: We perform Jaccard’s similarity index analysis between first person accounts of patients with the same disorder (in this case Major Depressive Disorder) and between those who received a diagnosis of a different disorder (in this case Bulimia Nervosa) to demonstrate that narratives, when suitably processed, are a rich source of data for this purpose. We then analyse 228 narratives of lived experiences from patients with mental disorders, using Python code script, to demonstrate that patients with the same diagnosis have very different illness experiences. Results: The results demonstrate that narratives are a statistically viable data resource which can distinguish between patients who receive different diagnostic labels. However, the similarity coefficients between 99.98% of narrative pairs, including for those with similar diagnoses, are low (< 0.3), indicating diagnostic Heterogeneity. Conclusions: The current study proposes an alternative approach to measuring diagnostic Heterogeneity of the categorical taxonomic systems (e.g. the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, DSM). In doing so, we demonstrate the high Heterogeneity and limited reliability of the existing system using patients’ written narratives of their illness experiences as the only data source.

Network analysis by systemic text excavation of the concept of personalized psychiatry and precision,"Gauld, C.; Micoulaud-Franchi, J.-A.","Objectives: The current challenges of psychiatric nosology and semiology are part of an interdisciplinary and integrative framework. The paradigm of the personalized and precision psychiatry proposes to study this discipline according to new approaches and methodologies. Personalized and precision psychiatry therefore requires clarification of its concepts. To our knowledge, there is no systematic exploration of the literature on the application of the concepts of personalized and precision medicine in the field of psychiatry. This article proposes thus to explore the framework of personalized and precision medicine applied to psychiatry. Methods: We explored the framework of personalized and precision medicine applied to psychiatry by a textual network analysis. Firstly, we performed a systematic text-mining (Natural Language Processing) from an exhaustive review of the international literature with the terms “precision psychiatry” and “personalized psychiatry”. Secondly, this analysis of textual data allowed us to build a textual network which made it possible to visualize the most proximal terms (the most frequently associated in the literature). Finally, we extracted from the network the main dimensions explored in the scientific literature, and we studied the relative importance of each term by analyzing the network centrality. In addition, a brief bibliometric analysis was conducted. Results: We show that personalized and precision psychiatry refers to six dimensions found in the textual network analysis which correspond to the scientific fields which study personalized and precision psychiatry: genetics, pharmacogenetics, artificial intelligence, therapeutic trials, biomarkers and staging. We explore how each dimension relates to the mechanization of psychiatric disorders. However, precision and personalized psychiatry, which tries to refine the levels of mechanistic explanations for psychiatry, suffers from a conceptual heterogeneity. Indeed, textual analysis also allows us to find terms referring to a set of heterogeneous concepts. Many methodological fields and epistemological concepts are invoked in this literature, without standardization. Conclusions: The paradox of personalized and precision psychiatry is to associate a strong conceptual heterogeneity with a well-defined mechanistic component. Heterogeneity found in literature on personalized and precision psychiatry testifies to the lack of a pluralist and integrative theoretical framework. This framework could be based on a naturalizing but non-reducing formalism, aware of the societal challenges of the sciences and their implementation in the research and clinical systems of psychiatry. © 2020 L'Encéphale, Paris",2021,,Encephale,47,4,341-347,,10.1016/j.encep.2020.08.008,,#1999,Gauld 2021,"",""

Documentation of screening for firearm access by healthcare providers in the veterans healthcare system: A retrospective study,"Brandt, C.A.; Elizabeth Workman, T.; Farmer, M.M.; Akgün, K.M.; Abel, E.A.; Skanderson, M.; Bean-Mayberry, B.; Zeng-Treitler, Q.; Mason, M.; Bastian, L.A.; Goulet, J.L.; Post, L.A.","Introduction: Presence of a firearm is associated with increased risk of violence and suicide. United States military veterans are at disproportionate risk of suicide. Routine healthcare provider screening of firearm access may prompt counseling on safe storage and handling of firearms. The objective of this study was to determine the frequency with which Veterans Health Administration (VHA) healthcare providers document firearm access in electronic health record (EHR) clinical notes, and whether this varied by patient characteristics. Methods: The study sample is a post-9-11 cohort of veterans in their first year of VHA care, with at least one outpatient care visit between 2012-2017 (N = 762,953). Demographic data, veteran military service characteristics, and clinical comorbidities were obtained from VHA EHR. We extracted clinical notes for outpatient visits to primary, urgent, or emergency clinics (total 105,316,004). Natural language processing and machine learning (ML) approaches were used to identify documentation of firearm access. A taxonomy of firearm terms was identified and manually annotated with text anchored by these terms, and then trained the ML algorithm. The random-forest algorithm achieved 81.9% accuracy in identifying documentation of firearm access. Results: The proportion of patients with EHR-documented access to one or more firearms during their first year of care in the VHA was relatively low and varied by patient characteristics. Men had significantly higher documentation of firearms than women (9.8% vs 7.1%; P < .001) and veterans >50 years old had the lowest (6.5%). Among veterans with any firearm term present, only 24.4% were classified as positive for access to a firearm (24.7% of men and 20.9% of women). Conclusion: Natural language processing can identify documentation of access to firearms in clinical notes with acceptable accuracy, but there is a need for investigation into facilitators and barriers for providers and veterans to improve a systemwide process of firearm access screening. Screening, regardless of race/ ethnicity, gender, and age, provides additional opportunities to protect veterans from self-harm and violence. © 2021 eScholarship.

Self-harm detection for mental health chatbots,"Deshpande, S.; Warren, J.","Chatbots potentially address deficits in availability of the traditional health workforce and could help to stem concerning rates of youth mental health issues including high suicide rates. While chatbots have shown some positive results in helping people cope with mental health issues, there are yet deep concerns regarding such chatbots in terms of their ability to identify emergency situations and act accordingly. Risk of suicide/self-harm is one such concern which we have addressed in this project. A chatbot decides its response based on the text input from the user and must correctly recognize the significance of a given input. We have designed a self-harm classifier which could use the user's response to the chatbot and predict whether the response indicates intent for selfharm. With the difficulty to access confidential counselling data, we looked for alternate data sources and found Twitter and Reddit to provide data similar to what we would expect to get from a chatbot user. We trained a sentiment analysis classifier on Twitter data and a self-harm classifier on the Reddit data. We combined the results of the two models to improve the model performance. We got the best results from a LSTM-RNN classifier using BERT encoding. The best model accuracy achieved was 92.13%. We tested the model on new data from Reddit and got an impressive result with an accuracy of 97%. Such a model is promising for future embedding in mental health chatbots to improve their safety through accurate detection of self-harm talk by users. © 2021 European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI) and IOS Press. © 2021 European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI) and IOS Press.

"Text mining occupations from the mental health electronic health record: A natural language processing approach using records from the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) platform in south London, UK","Chilman, N.; Song, X.; Roberts, A.; Tolani, E.; Stewart, R.; Chui, Z.; Birnie, K.; Harber-Aschan, L.; Gazard, B.; Chandran, D.; Sanyal, J.; Hatch, S.; Kolliakou, A.; Das-Munshi, J.","Objectives We set out to develop, evaluate and implement a novel application using natural language processing to text mine occupations from the free-text of psychiatric clinical notes. Design Development and validation of a natural language processing application using General Architecture for Text Engineering software to extract occupations from de-identified clinical records. Setting and participants Electronic health records from a large secondary mental healthcare provider in south London, accessed through the Clinical Record Interactive Search platform. The text mining application was run over the free-text fields in the electronic health records of 341 720 patients (all aged ≥16 years). Outcomes Precision and recall estimates of the application performance; occupation retrieval using the application compared with structured fields; most common patient occupations; and analysis of key sociodemographic and clinical indicators for occupation recording. Results Using the structured fields alone, only 14% of patients had occupation recorded. By implementing the text mining application in addition to the structured fields, occupations were identified in 57% of patients. The application performed on gold-standard human-annotated clinical text at a precision level of 0.79 and recall level of 0.77. The most common patient occupations recorded were 'student' and 'unemployed'. Patients with more service contact were more likely to have an occupation recorded, as were patients of a male gender, older age and those living in areas of lower deprivation. Conclusion This is the first time a natural language processing application has been used to successfully derive patient-level occupations from the free-text of electronic mental health records, performing with good levels of precision and recall, and applied at scale. This may be used to inform clinical studies relating to the broader social determinants of health using electronic health records.  © Author(s) 2021.",2021,,BMJ Open,11,3,,,10.1136/bmjopen-2020-042274,,#2007,Chilman 2021,"",""
Utilizing a multi-class classification approach to detect therapeutic and recreational misuse of opioids on Twitter,"Fodeh, S.J.; Al-Garadi, M.; Elsankary, O.; Perrone, J.; Becker, W.; Sarker, A.","Background: Opioid misuse (OM) is a major health problem in the United States, and can lead to addiction and fatal overdose. We sought to employ natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to categorize Twitter chatter based on the motive of OM. Materials and methods: We collected data from Twitter using opioid-related keywords, and manually annotated 6988 tweets into three classes—No-OM, Pain-related-OM, and Recreational-OM—with the No-OM class representing tweets indicating no use/misuse, and the Pain-related misuse and Recreational-misuse classes representing misuse for pain or recreation/addiction. We trained and evaluated multi-class classifiers, and performed term-level k-means clustering to assess whether there were terms closely associated with the three classes. Results: On a held-out test set of 1677 tweets, a transformer-based classifier (XLNet) achieved the best performance with F1-score of 0.71 for the Pain-misuse class, and 0.79 for the Recreational-misuse class. Macro- and micro-averaged F1-scores over all classes were 0.82 and 0.92, respectively. Content-analysis using clustering revealed distinct clusters of terms associated with each class. Discussion: While some past studies have attempted to automatically detect opioid misuse, none have further characterized the motive for misuse. Our multi-class classification approach using XLNet showed promising performance, including in detecting the subtle differences between pain-related and recreation-related misuse. The distinct clustering of class-specific keywords may help conduct targeted data collection, overcoming under-representation of minority classes. Conclusion: Machine learning can help identify pain-related and recreational-related OM contents on Twitter to potentially enable the study of the characteristics of individuals exhibiting such behavior. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2021,,Computers in Biology and Medicine,129,,,,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.104132,,#2011,Fodeh 2021,"",""

Multi-modal adaptive fusion transformer network for the estimation of depression level,"Sun, H.; Liu, J.; Chai, S.; Qiu, Z.; Lin, L.; Huang, X.; Chen, Y.","Depression is a severe psychological condition that affects millions of people worldwide. As depression has received more attention in recent years, it has become imperative to develop automatic methods for detecting depression. Although numerous machine learning methods have been proposed for estimating the levels of depression via audio, visual, and audiovisual emotion sensing, several challenges still exist. For example, it is difficult to extract long-term temporal context information from long sequences of audio and visual data, and it is also difficult to select and fuse useful multi-modal information or features effectively. In addition, how to include other information or tasks to enhance the estimation accuracy is also one of the challenges. In this study, we propose a multi-modal adaptive fusion transformer network for estimating the levels of depression. Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in language understanding and sequence modeling. Thus, the proposed transformer-based network is utilized to extract long-term temporal context information from uni-modal audio and visual data in our work. This is the first transformer-based approach for depression detection. We also propose an adaptive fusion method for adaptively fusing useful multi-modal features. Furthermore, inspired by current multitask learning work, we also incorporate an auxiliary task (depression classification) to enhance the main task of depression level regression (estimation). The effectiveness of the proposed method has been validated on a public dataset (AVEC 2019 Detecting Depression with AI Sub-challenge) in terms of the PHQ-8 scores. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves better performance compared with currently state-of-the-art methods. Our proposed method achieves a concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.733 on AVEC 2019 which is 6.2% higher than the accuracy (CCC = 0.696) of the state-of-the-art method. © 2021 by the authors.

Presently there is a strong and consistent association between social media use and eating concerns. Natural Language Processing, a branch of artificial intelligence, has the potential to contribute towards early anorexia detection in textual data.

Leveraging social media activity and machine learning for HIV and substance abuse risk assessment: Development and validation study,"Ovalle, A.; Goldstein, O.; Kachuee, M.; Wu, E.S.C.; Hong, C.; Holloway, I.W.; Sarrafzadeh, M.","Background: Social media networks provide an abundance of diverse information that can be leveraged for data-driven applications across various social and physical sciences. One opportunity to utilize such data exists in the public health domain, where data collection is often constrained by organizational funding and limited user adoption. Furthermore, the efficacy of health interventions is often based on self-reported data, which are not always reliable. Health-promotion strategies for communities facing multiple vulnerabilities, such as men who have sex with men, can benefit from an automated system that not only determines health behavior risk but also suggests appropriate intervention targets. Objective: This study aims to determine the value of leveraging social media messages to identify health risk behavior for men who have sex with men. Methods: The Gay Social Networking Analysis Program was created as a preliminary framework for intelligent web-based health-promotion intervention. The program consisted of a data collection system that automatically gathered social media data, health questionnaires, and clinical results for sexually transmitted diseases and drug tests across 51 participants over 3 months. Machine learning techniques were utilized to assess the relationship between social media messages and participants' offline sexual health and substance use biological outcomes. The F1 score, a weighted average of precision and recall, was used to evaluate each algorithm. Natural language processing techniques were employed to create health behavior risk scores from participant messages. Results: Offline HIV, amphetamine, and methamphetamine use were correctly identified using only social media data, with machine learning models obtaining F1 scores of 82.6%, 85.9%, and 85.3%, respectively. Additionally, constructed risk scores were found to be reasonably comparable to risk scores adapted from the Center for Disease Control. Conclusions: To our knowledge, our study is the first empirical evaluation of a social media-based public health intervention framework for men who have sex with men. We found that social media data were correlated with offline sexual health and substance use, verified through biological testing. The proof of concept and initial results validate that public health interventions can indeed use social media-based systems to successfully determine offline health risk behaviors. The findings demonstrate the promise of deploying a social media-based just-in-time adaptive intervention to target substance use and HIV risk behavior. © 2021 Anaelia Ovalle, Orpaz Goldstein, Mohammad Kachuee, Elizabeth S C Wu, Chenglin Hong, Ian W Holloway, Majid Sarrafzadeh.",2021,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,23,4,,,10.2196/22042,,#2032,Ovalle 2021,"",""
Using weak supervision and deep learning to classify clinical notes for identification of current suicidal ideation,"Cusick, M.; Adekkanattu, P.; Campion, T.R.; Sholle, E.T.; Myers, A.; Banerjee, S.; Alexopoulos, G.; Wang, Y.; Pathak, J.","Mental health concerns, such as suicidal thoughts, are frequently documented by providers in clinical notes, as opposed to structured coded data. In this study, we evaluated weakly supervised methods for detecting “current” suicidal ideation from unstructured clinical notes in electronic health record (EHR) systems. Weakly supervised machine learning methods leverage imperfect labels for training, alleviating the burden of creating a large manually annotated dataset. After identifying a cohort of 600 patients at risk for suicidal ideation, we used a rule-based natural language processing approach (NLP) approach to label the training and validation notes (n = 17,978). Using this large corpus of clinical notes, we trained several statistical machine learning models—logistic classifier, support vector machines (SVM), Naive Bayes classifier—and one deep learning model, namely a text classification convolutional neural network (CNN), to be evaluated on a manually-reviewed test set (n = 837). The CNN model outperformed all other methods, achieving an overall accuracy of 94% and a F1-score of 0.82 on documents with “current” suicidal ideation. This algorithm correctly identified an additional 42 encounters and 9 patients indicative of suicidal ideation but missing a structured diagnosis code. When applied to a random subset of 5,000 clinical notes, the algorithm classified 0.46% (n = 23) for “current” suicidal ideation, of which 87% were truly indicative via manual review.

Analyzing digital evidence from a telemental health platform to assess complex psychological responses to the COVID-19 pandemic: Content analysis of text messages,"Hull, T.D.; Levine, J.; Bantilan, N.; Desai, A.N.; Majumder, M.S.","Background: The novel COVID-19 disease has negatively impacted mortality, economic conditions, and mental health. These impacts are likely to continue after the COVID-19 pandemic ends. There are no methods for characterizing the mental health burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, and differentiating this burden from that of the prepandemic era. Accurate illness detection methods are critical for facilitating pandemic-related treatment and preventing the worsening of symptoms. Objective: We aimed to identify major themes and symptom clusters in the SMS text messages that patients send to therapists. We assessed patients who were seeking treatment for pandemic-related distress on Talkspace, which is a popular telemental health platform. Methods: We used a machine learning algorithm to identify patients’ pandemic-related concerns, based on their SMS text messages in a large, digital mental health service platform (ie, Talkspace). This platform uses natural language processing methods to analyze unstructured therapy transcript data, in parallel with brief clinical assessment methods for analyzing depression and anxiety symptoms. Results: Our results show a significant increase in the incidence of COVID-19–related intake anxiety symptoms (P<.001), but no significant differences in the incidence of intake depression symptoms (P=.79). During our transcript analyses, we identified terms that were related to 24 symptoms outside of those included in the diagnostic criteria for anxiety and depression. Conclusions: Our findings for Talkspace suggest that people who seek treatment during the pandemic experience more severe intake anxiety than they did before the COVID-19 outbreak.

Attention-Based Deep Entropy Active Learning Using Lexical Algorithm for Mental Health Treatment,"Ahmed, U.; Mukhiya, S.K.; Srivastava, G.; Lamo, Y.; Lin, J.C.-W.","With the increasing prevalence of Internet usage, Internet-Delivered Psychological Treatment (IDPT) has become a valuable tool to develop improved treatments of mental disorders. IDPT becomes complicated and labor intensive because of overlapping emotion in mental health. To create a usable learning application for IDPT requires diverse labeled datasets containing an adequate set of linguistic properties to extract word representations and segmentations of emotions. In medical applications, it is challenging to successfully refine such datasets since emotion-aware labeling is time consuming. Other known issues include vocabulary sizes per class, data source, method of creation, and baseline for the human performance level. This paper focuses on the application of personalized mental health interventions using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and attention-based in-depth entropy active learning. The objective of this research is to increase the trainable instances using a semantic clustering mechanism. For this purpose, we propose a method based on synonym expansion by semantic vectors. Semantic vectors based on semantic information derived from the context in which it appears are clustered. The resulting similarity metrics help to select the subset of unlabeled text by using semantic information. The proposed method separates unlabeled text and includes it in the next active learning mechanism cycle. Our method updates model training by using the new training points. The cycle continues until it reaches an optimal solution, and it converts all the unlabeled text into the training set. Our in-depth experimental results show that the synonym expansion semantic vectors help enhance training accuracy while not harming the results. The bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture with an attention mechanism achieved 0.85 Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC curve) on the blind test set.

According to the 2020 Surgeon General's report, smoking cessation may reduce CM but supporting evidence is not wide. Use of deep learning-based modeling that enables universal natural language processing of medical narratives to acquire population-based real-life smoking data may help overcome the challenge. We assessed the effect of smoking status and within-1-year smoking cessation on CM by an in-house adapted freely available language processing algorithm. Materials and methods: This cross-sectional real-world study included 29 823 patients diagnosed with cancer in 2009-2018 in Southwest Finland. The medical narrative, International Classification of Diseases-10th edition codes, histology, cancer treatment records, and death certificates were combined. Over 162 000 sentences describing tobacco smoking behavior were analyzed with ULMFiT and BERT algorithms. Results: The language model classified the smoking status of 23 031 patients. Recent quitters had reduced CM [hazard ratio (HR) 0.80 (0.74-0.87)] and OM [HR 0.78 (0.72-0.84)] compared to persistent smokers. Compared to never smokers, persistent smokers had increased CM in head and neck, gastro-esophageal, pancreatic, lung, prostate, and breast cancer and Hodgkin's lymphoma, irrespective of age, comorbidities, performance status, or presence of metastatic disease. Increased CM was also observed in smokers with colorectal cancer, men with melanoma or bladder cancer, and lymphoid and myeloid leukemia, but no longer independently of the abovementioned covariates. Specificity and sensitivity were 96%/96%, 98%/68%, and 88%/99% for never, former, and current smokers, respectively, being essentially the same with both models. Conclusions: Deep learning can be used to classify large amounts of smoking data from the medical narrative with good accuracy. The results highlight the detrimental effects of persistent smoking in oncologic patients and emphasize that smoking cessation should always be an essential element of patient counseling. © 2021 The Author(s)",2021,,ESMO Open,6,3,,,10.1016/j.esmoop.2021.100175,,#2039,Karlsson 2021,"",""

In the absence of vaccines and antivirals, several behavioral change and policy initiatives such as physical distancing have been implemented to control the spread of COVID-19. Social media data can reveal public perceptions toward how governments and health agencies worldwide are handling the pandemic, and the impact of the disease on people regardless of their geographic locations in line with various factors that hinder or facilitate the efforts to control the spread of the pandemic globally. Objective: This paper aims to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people worldwide using social media data. Methods: We applied natural language processing (NLP) and thematic analysis to understand public opinions, experiences, and issues with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic using social media data. First, we collected over 47 million COVID-19-related comments from Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and three online discussion forums. Second, we performed data preprocessing, which involved applying NLP techniques to clean and prepare the data for automated key phrase extraction. Third, we applied the NLP approach to extract meaningful key phrases from over 1 million randomly selected comments and computed sentiment score for each key phrase and assigned sentiment polarity (ie, positive, negative, or neutral) based on the score using a lexicon-based technique. Fourth, we grouped related negative and positive key phrases into categories or broad themes. Results: A total of 34 negative themes emerged, out of which 15 were health-related issues, psychosocial issues, and social issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic from the public perspective. Some of the health-related issues were increased mortality, health concerns, struggling health systems, and fitness issues; while some of the psychosocial issues were frustrations due to life disruptions, panic shopping, and expression of fear. Social issues were harassment, domestic violence, and wrong societal attitude. In addition, 20 positive themes emerged from our results. Some of the positive themes were public awareness, encouragement, gratitude, cleaner environment, online learning, charity, spiritual support, and innovative research. Conclusions: We uncovered various negative and positive themes representing public perceptions toward the COVID-19 pandemic and recommended interventions that can help address the health, psychosocial, and social issues based on the positive themes and other research evidence. These interventions will help governments, health professionals and agencies, institutions, and individuals in their efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19 and minimize its impact, and in reacting to any future pandemics.  © 2021 Oladapo Oyebode, Chinenye Ndulue, Ashfaq Adib, Dinesh Mulchandani, Banuchitra Suruliraj, Fidelia Anulika Orji, Christine T Chambers, Sandra Meier, Rita Orji.",2021,,JMIR Medical Informatics,9,4,,,10.2196/22734,,#2040,Oyebode 2021,"",""
Classifying Alzheimer's Disease Using Audio and Text-Based Representations of Speech,"Haulcy, R.; Glass, J.","Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a form of dementia that affects the memory, cognition, and motor skills of patients.

In this paper, the ADReSS dataset, a dataset balanced by gender and age, was used to automatically classify AD from spontaneous speech. The performance of five classifiers, as well as a convolutional neural network and long short-term memory network, was compared when trained on audio features (i-vectors and x-vectors) and text features (word vectors, BERT embeddings, LIWC features, and CLAN features). The same audio and text features were used to train five regression models to predict the Mini-Mental State Examination score for each patient, a score that has a maximum value of 30. The top-performing classification models were the support vector machine and random forest classifiers trained on BERT embeddings, which both achieved an accuracy of 85.4% on the test set. The best-performing regression model was the gradient boosting regression model trained on BERT embeddings and CLAN features, which had a root mean squared error of 4.56 on the test set. The performance on both tasks illustrates the feasibility of using speech to classify AD and predict neuropsychological scores. © Copyright © 2021 Haulcy and Glass.",2021,,Frontiers in Psychology,11,,,,10.3389/fpsyg.2020.624137,,#2041,Haulcy 2021,"",""
Analysis of Public Opinion Evolution in COVID-19 Pandemic from a Perspective of Sentiment Variation,"Zhang, C.; Ma, X.; Zhou, Y.; Guo, R.","As a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), the COVID-19 pandemic caused great concern in social media all over the world. The content of Weibo comments is a collection of users' perceptions, attitudes, tendencies, and behaviors of the pandemic, and provides a high-timeliness and high-sequence text corpus for public opinion evolution research based on sentiment analysis. In this paper, we used a corpus obtained from People's Daily on Weibo during COVID-19 pandemic (January 23 - April 8, 2020) as our research data. First, we extracted emotional tendencies to classify text comments into positive and negative sentiments with SnowNLP, a Chinese natural language processing tool. Second, based on the Single-Pass clustering algorithm, we implemented text cluster analysis to explore hot topics about the pandemic situation. Moreover, we realized the information mining about public attention by using the Louvain community analysis algorithm. (1) On temporal dimension, the result of daily emotional trend analysis shows that the public has experienced three emotional phases, which are a period presenting anxiety and fear (January 23 - February 18), a period presenting steadiness and confidence (February 19 - March 15) and a period presenting tension and concern (March 16 - April 8). (2) On a spatial dimension, joint analysis of the number of users, the emotional states, and emotional projections among different provinces shows obvious differences in the public attention and emotional value of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, for those Weibo users in COVID-19 affected areas, the level of their online participation is positively correlated with the pandemic severity and the value of the emotional state and emotional projection is lower. Meanwhile, those in worst-hit areas tend to have a higher impact on the evolution of public opinion. The results show that Weibo users in Guangdong Province and Heilongjiang Province have high levels of attention and low averages of emotional state and emotional projection. It can be judged the two provinces are still facing great pressure for pandemic prevention and control. Although Hubei Province is most affected by the pandemic, with a low emotional state value but a high emotional projection value, it is speculated Weibo users' comments on Hubei Province are more encouraging and praised. In addition, the number of confirmed cases in the northwestern region is relatively small, and the number of comment participation is less than in other regions, but the averages of emotional state and emotional projection are higher. The research applies natural language processing and network community detection algorithms to construct a methodological framework of public opinion analysis for social media comments. The developed framework has promising potentials, as it provides theoretical and practical support for related research on major public events. 2021, Science Press.

Sentiment analysis techniques applied to raw-text data from a csq-8 questionnaire about mindfulness in times of covid-19 to improve strategy generation,"Acosta, M.J.; Castillo-Sánchez, G.; Garcia-Zapirain, B.; de la Torre Díez, I.; Franco-Martín, M.","The use of artificial intelligence in health care has grown quickly. In this sense, we present our work related to the application of Natural Language Processing techniques, as a tool to analyze the sentiment perception of users who answered two questions from the CSQ-8 questionnaires with raw Spanish free-text. Their responses are related to mindfulness, which is a novel technique used to control stress and anxiety caused by different factors in daily life. As such, we proposed an online course where this method was applied in order to improve the quality of life of health care professionals in COVID 19 pandemic times. We also carried out an evaluation of the satisfaction level of the participants involved, with a view to establishing strategies to improve future experiences. To automatically perform this task, we used Natural Language Processing (NLP) models such as swivel embedding, neural networks, and transfer learning, so as to classify the inputs into the following three categories: negative, neutral, and positive. Due to the limited amount of data available—86 registers for the first and 68 for the second—transfer learning techniques were required. The length of the text had no limit from the user’s standpoint, and our approach attained a maximum accuracy of 93.02% and 90.53%, respectively, based on ground truth labeled by three experts. Finally, we proposed a complementary analysis, using computer graphic text representation based on word frequency, to help researchers identify relevant information about the opinions with an objective approach to sentiment. The main conclusion drawn from this work is that the application of NLP techniques in small amounts of data using transfer learning is able to obtain enough accuracy in sentiment analysis and text classification stages. © 2021 by the authors.",2021,,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,18,12,,,10.3390/ijerph18126408,,#2044,Acosta 2021,"",""
Modeling human motives and emotions from personal narratives using external knowledge and entity tracking,"Vijayaraghavan, P.; Roy, D.","The ability to automatically understand and infer characters' motivations and emotional states is key to better narrative comprehension. In this work, we propose a Transformer-based architecture, referred to as , to model characters' motives and emotions from personal narratives. Towards this goal, we incorporate social commonsense knowledge about the mental states of people related to social events and employ dynamic state tracking of entities using an augmented memory module. Our model learns to produce contextual embeddings and explanations of characters' mental states by integrating external knowledge along with prior narrative context and mental state encodings. We leverage weakly-annotated personal narratives and knowledge data to train our model and demonstrate its effectiveness on publicly available dataset containing annotations for character mental states. Further, we show that the learned mental state embeddings can be applied in downstream tasks such as empathetic response generation.

"Job-Related Problems Prior to Nurse Suicide, 2003-2017: A Mixed Methods Analysis Using Natural Language Processing and Thematic Analysis","Davidson, J.E.; Ye, G.; Parra, M.C.; Choflet, A.; Lee, K.; Barnes, A.; Harkavy-Friedman, J.; Zisook, S.","Background: Nurses have a higher rate of suicide than the gender-matched general population at baseline. Quantitative data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Violent Death Reporting System have been previously analyzed to reveal that nurses have more known job-related issues prior to death by suicide. However, no known study has focused on the context of those job-related problems prior to nurse suicide. Purpose: The aim of this study was to provide context to job-related problems experienced before nurse death by suicide. Methods: Cases were selected either because they were coded as having a job-related problem prior to death or the words “job” or “work” appeared in the case investigation narrative. Natural language processing and thematic analysis of free-text medical examiner and law enforcement investigation narratives were performed to better describe nurse deaths by suicide in cases with known job-related problems prior to death. Results: Narratives from a total of 203 nurse deaths from between 2003 and 2017 were included in this study. Very little was reported regarding the actual work of being a nurse. Job-related problems of these 203 deaths focused on substance use, mental health problems, chronic pain, or job loss due to investigations for substance use or diversion of medication. Conclusions: Nurses who lose a nursing position or leave the profession because of substance use, mental health issues, or chronic pain are at risk for nurse suicide. Alternative-to-discipline programs for nurses with substance use disorder need to be improved and standardized.

Exploring Deep Transfer Learning Techniques for Alzheimer's Dementia Detection,"Zhu, Y.; Liang, X.; Batsis, J.A.; Roth, R.M.","Examination of speech datasets for detecting dementia, collected via various speech tasks, has revealed links between speech and cognitive abilities. However, the speech dataset available for this research is extremely limited because the collection process of speech and baseline data from patients with dementia in clinical settings is expensive. In this paper, we study the spontaneous speech dataset from a recent ADReSS challenge, a Cookie Theft Picture (CTP) dataset with balanced groups of participants in age, gender, and cognitive status. We explore state-of-the-art deep transfer learning techniques from image, audio, speech, and language domains. We envision that one advantage of transfer learning is to eliminate the design of handcrafted features based on the tasks and datasets. Transfer learning further mitigates the limited dementia-relevant speech data problem by inheriting knowledge from similar but much larger datasets. Specifically, we built a variety of transfer learning models using commonly employed MobileNet (image), YAMNet (audio), Mockingjay (speech), and BERT (text) models. Results indicated that the transfer learning models of text data showed significantly better performance than those of audio data. Performance gains of the text models may be due to the high similarity between the pre-training text dataset and the CTP text dataset. Our multi-modal transfer learning introduced a slight improvement in accuracy, demonstrating that audio and text data provide limited complementary information. Multi-task transfer learning resulted in limited improvements in classification and a negative impact in regression. By analyzing the meaning behind the Alzheimer's disease (AD)/non-AD labels and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, we observed that the inconsistency between labels and scores could limit the performance of the multi-task learning, especially when the outputs of the single-task models are highly consistent with the corresponding labels/scores. In sum, we conducted a large comparative analysis of varying transfer learning models focusing less on model customization but more on pre-trained models and pre-training datasets. We revealed insightful relations among models, data types, and data labels in this research area. © Copyright © 2021 Zhu, Liang, Batsis and Roth.",2021,,Frontiers in Computer Science,3,,,,10.3389/fcomp.2021.624683,,#2054,Zhu 2021,"",""
Relationship Identification Between Conversational Agents Using Emotion Analysis,"Qamar, S.; Mujtaba, H.; Majeed, H.; Beg, M.O.","Human relationships are influenced by the underlying emotions in their interactions. With the increasing use of social networks, relationships from textual data can also be inferred from online interactions. Such interactions result in massive amount of textual data which is available in the form of text messages, emails, and social media posts. Identification and analysis of human relationships are useful for numerous applications ranging from cybersecurity to public health. In this paper, we present a method called RIEA (Relationship Identification using Emotion Analysis), for identifying relationships between multiple intelligent agents by analyzing the conversation between them. The objective of our work is to combine concepts of cognitive psychology and natural language processing (NLP) to extract emotions and map them onto a set of relationships and analyze how relationships transform over time. We employ psychological models to label a large corpus of conversations and apply machine learning techniques to determine emotion-to-relationship mapping. We use four distinct association classes and four attachment styles using best-worst scaling method for classification. Combining the attachment and association styles given in research literature gives us the relationship combinations for our analysis. Additionally, this work studies the most common changes of behaviors and emotions and the corresponding transformations in human relationships. Our results show that RIEA can correctly detect interpersonal relationships with an accuracy of 85%. The evaluation shows that RIEA can accurately identify interpersonal relationships from conversations and can be extended for identifying more complex relationships. This study also highlights the effect of changes in emotional behavior in the development of relationships over time. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.",2021,,Cognitive Computation,13,3,673-687,,10.1007/s12559-020-09806-5,,#2058,Qamar 2021,"",""
Deep Learning-Based Natural Language Processing for Screening Psychiatric Patients,"Dai, H.-J.; Su, C.-H.; Lee, Y.-Q.; Zhang, Y.-C.; Wang, C.-K.; Kuo, C.-J.; Wu, C.-S.","The introduction of pre-trained language models in natural language processing (NLP) based on deep learning and the availability of electronic health records (EHRs) presents a great opportunity to transfer the “knowledge” learned from data in the general domain to enable the analysis of unstructured textual data in clinical domains. This study explored the feasibility of applying NLP to a small EHR dataset to investigate the power of transfer learning to facilitate the process of patient screening in psychiatry. A total of 500 patients were randomly selected from a medical center database. Three annotators with clinical experience reviewed the notes to make diagnoses for major/minor depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and dementia to form a small and highly imbalanced corpus. Several state-of-the-art NLP methods based on deep learning along with pre-trained models based on shallow or deep transfer learning were adapted to develop models to classify the aforementioned diseases. We hypothesized that the models that rely on transferred knowledge would be expected to outperform the models learned from scratch. The experimental results demonstrated that the models with the pre-trained techniques outperformed the models without transferred knowledge by micro-avg. and macro-avg.

"Gender differences in clinical presentation and illicit substance use during first episode psychosis: A natural language processing, electronic case register study","Irving, J.; Colling, C.; Shetty, H.; Pritchard, M.; Stewart, R.; Fusar-Poli, P.; McGuire, P.; Patel, R.","Objective To determine whether gender differences in symptom presentation at first episode psychosis (FEP) remain even when controlling for substance use, age and ethnicity, using natural language processing applied to electronic health records (EHRs). Design, setting and participants Data were extracted from EHRs of 3350 people (62% male patients) who had presented to the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust with a FEP between 1 April 2007 and 31 March 2017. Logistic regression was used to examine gender differences in the presentation of positive, negative, depressive, mania and disorganisation symptoms. Exposure(s) (for observational studies) Gender (male vs female). Main outcome(s) and measure(s) Presence of positive, negative, depressive, mania and disorganisation symptoms at initial clinical presentation. Results Eight symptoms were significantly more prevalent in men (poverty of thought, negative symptoms, social withdrawal, poverty of speech, aggression, grandiosity, paranoia and agitation). Conversely, tearfulness, low energy, reduced appetite, low mood, pressured speech, mood instability, flight of ideas, guilt, mutism, insomnia, poor concentration, tangentiality and elation were more prevalent in women than men. Negative symptoms were more common among men (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.62) and depressive and manic symptoms more common among women (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.35). After adjustment for illicit substance use, the strength of associations between gender and negative, manic and depression symptoms increased, whereas gender differences in aggression, agitation, paranoia and grandiosity became insignificant. Conclusions There are clear gender differences in the clinical presentation of FEP. Our findings suggest that gender can have a substantial influence on the nature of clinical presentation in people with psychosis, and that this is only partly explained by exposure to illicit substance use.  © 2021 Author(s) (or their employer(s).

A natural language processing and deep learning approach to identify child abuse from pediatric electronic medical records,"Annapragada, A.V.; Donaruma, M.M.; Starosolski, Z.A.","Child physical abuse is a leading cause of traumatic injury and death in children. In 2017, child abuse was responsible for 1688 fatalities in the United States, of 3.5 million children referred to Child Protection Services and 674,000 substantiated victims. While large referral hospitals maintain teams trained in Child Abuse Pediatrics, smaller community hospitals often do not have such dedicated resources to evaluate patients for potential abuse. Moreover, identification of abuse has a low margin of error, as false positive identifications lead to unwarranted separations, while false negatives allow dangerous situations to continue. This context makes the consistent detection of and response to abuse difficult, particularly given subtle signs in young, non-verbal patients. Here, we describe the development of artificial intelligence algorithms that use unstructured free-text in the electronic medical record - including notes from physicians, nurses, and social workers - to identify children who are suspected victims of physical abuse. Importantly, only the notes from time of first encounter (e.g.: birth, routine visit, sickness) to the last record before child protection team involvement were used. This allowed us to develop an algorithm using only information available prior to referral to the specialized child protection team. The study was performed in a multi-center referral pediatric hospital on patients screened for abuse within five different locations between 2015 and 2019. Of 1123 patients, 867 records were available after data cleaning and processing, and 55% were abuse-positive as determined by a multi-disciplinary team of clinical professionals. These electronic medical records were encoded with three natural language processing (NLP) algorithms - Bag of Words (BOW), Word Embeddings (WE), and Rules-Based (RB) - and used to train multiple neural network architectures. The BOW and WE encodings utilize the full free-text, while RB selects crucial phrases as identified by physicians. The best architecture was selected by average classification accuracy for the best performing model from each train-test split of a cross-validation experiment. Natural language processing coupled with neural networks detected cases of likely child abuse using only information available to clinicians prior to child protection team referral with average accuracy of 0.90±0.02 and average area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) 0.93±0.02 for the best performing Bag of Words models. The best performing rules-based models achieved average accuracy of 0.77±0.04 and average ROCAUC 0.81±0.05, while a Word Embeddings strategy was severely limited by lack of representative embeddings. Importantly, the best performing model had a false positive rate of 8%, as compared to rates of 20% or higher in previously reported studies. This artificial intelligence approach can help screen patients for whom an abuse concern exists and streamline the identification of patients who may benefit from referral to a child protection team. Furthermore, this approach could be applied to develop computer-aided-diagnosis platforms for the challenging and often intractable problem of reliably identifying pediatric patients suffering from physical abuse. © 2021 Annapragada et al.

A chatbot for perinatal women⇔s and partners⇔ obstetric and mental health care: development and usability evaluation study,"Chung, K.; Cho, H.Y.; Park, J.Y.","Background: To motivate people to adopt medical chatbots, the establishment of a specialized medical knowledge database that fits their personal interests is of great importance in developing a chatbot for perinatal care, particularly with the help of health professionals. Objective: The objectives of this study are to develop and evaluate a user-friendly question-and-answer (Q&A) knowledge database–based chatbot (Dr. Joy) for perinatal women’s and their partners’ obstetric and mental health care by applying a text-mining technique and implementing contextual usability testing (UT), respectively, thus determining whether this medical chatbot built on mobile instant messenger (KakaoTalk) can provide its male and female users with good user experience. Methods: Two men aged 38 and 40 years and 13 women aged 27 to 43 years in pregnancy preparation or different pregnancy stages were enrolled. All participants completed the 7-day-long UT, during which they were given the daily tasks of asking Dr. Joy at least 3 questions at any time and place and then giving the chatbot either positive or negative feedback with emoji, using at least one feature of the chatbot, and finally, sending a facilitator all screenshots for the history of the day’s use via KakaoTalk before midnight. One day after the UT completion, all participants were asked to fill out a questionnaire on the evaluation of usability, perceived benefits and risks, intention to seek and share health information on the chatbot, and strengths and weaknesses of its use, as well as demographic characteristics. Results: Despite the relatively higher score of ease of learning (EOL), the results of the Spearman correlation indicated that EOL was not significantly associated with usefulness (ρ=0.26; P=.36), ease of use (ρ=0.19; P=.51), satisfaction (ρ=0.21; P=.46), or total usability scores (ρ=0.32; P=.24). Unlike EOL, all 3 subfactors and the total usability had significant positive associations with each other (all ρ>0.80; P<.001). Furthermore, perceived risks exhibited no significant negative associations with perceived benefits (ρ=−0.29; P=.30) or intention to seek (SEE; ρ=−0.28; P=.32) or share (SHA; ρ=−0.24; P=.40) health information on the chatbot via KakaoTalk, whereas perceived benefits exhibited significant positive associations with both SEE and SHA. Perceived benefits were more strongly associated with SEE (ρ=0.94; P<.001) than with SHA (ρ=0.70; P=.004). Conclusions: This study provides the potential for the uptake of this newly developed Q&A knowledge database–based KakaoTalk chatbot for obstetric and mental health care. As Dr. Joy had quality contents with both utilitarian and hedonic value, its male and female users could be encouraged to use medical chatbots in a convenient, easy-to-use, and enjoyable manner. To boost their continued usage intention for Dr. Joy, its Q&A sets need to be periodically updated to satisfy user intent by monitoring both male and female user utterances. ©Kyungmi Chung, Hee Young Cho, Jin Young Park.",2021,,JMIR Medical Informatics,9,3,,,10.2196/18607,,#2068,Chung 2021,"",""
Subsentence extraction from text using coverage-based deep learning language models,"Lim, J.; Sa, I.; Ahn, H.S.; Gasteiger, N.; Lee, S.J.; Macdonald, B.","Sentiment prediction remains a challenging and unresolved task in various research fields, including psychology, neuroscience, and computer science. This stems from its high degree of subjectivity and limited input sources that can effectively capture the actual sentiment. This can be even more challenging with only text-based input. Meanwhile, the rise of deep learning and an unprecedented large volume of data have paved the way for artificial intelligence to perform impressively accurate predictions or even human-level reasoning. Drawing inspiration from this, we propose a coverage-based sentiment and subsentence extraction system that estimates a span of input text and recursively feeds this information back to the networks. The predicted subsentence consists of auxiliary information expressing a sentiment. This is an important building block for enabling vivid and epic sentiment delivery (within the scope of this paper) and for other natural language processing tasks such as text summarisation and Q&A. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin in subsentence prediction (i.e., Average Jaccard scores from 0.72 to 0.89). For the evaluation, we designed rigorous experiments consisting of 24 ablation studies.

Searching the PDF Haystack: Automated Knowledge Discovery in Scanned EHR Documents,"Kostrinsky-Thomas, A.L.; Hisama, F.M.; Payne, T.H.","Background Clinicians express concern that they may be unaware of important information contained in voluminous scanned and other outside documents contained in electronic health records (EHRs). An example is unrecognized EHR risk factor information, defined as risk factors for heritable cancer that exist within a patient's EHR but are not known by current treating providers. In a related study using manual EHR chart review, we found that half of the women whose EHR contained risk factor information meet criteria for further genetic risk evaluation for heritable forms of breast and ovarian cancer. They were not referred for genetic counseling. Objectives The purpose of this study was to compare the use of automated methods (optical character recognition with natural language processing) versus human review in their ability to identify risk factors for heritable breast and ovarian cancer within EHR scanned documents. Methods We evaluated the accuracy of the chart review by comparing our criterion standard (physician chart review) versus an automated method involving Amazon's Textract service (Amazon.com, Seattle, Washington, United States), a clinical language annotation modeling and processing toolkit (CLAMP) (Center for Computational Biomedicine at The University of Texas Health Science, Houston, Texas, United States), and a custom-written Java application. Results We found that automated methods identified most cancer risk factor information that would otherwise require clinician manual review and therefore is at risk of being missed. Conclusion The use of automated methods for identification of heritable risk factors within EHRs may provide an accurate yet rapid review of patients' past medical histories.

Natural language processing of clinical notes to identify mental illness and substance use among people living with HIV: Retrospective cohort study,"Ridgway, J.P.; Uvin, A.; Schmitt, J.; Oliwa, T.; Almirol, E.; Devlin, S.; Schneider, J.","Background: Mental illness and substance use are prevalent among people living with HIV and often lead to poor health outcomes. Electronic medical record (EMR) data are increasingly being utilized for HIV-related clinical research and care, but mental illness and substance use are often underdocumented in structured EMR fields. Natural language processing (NLP) of unstructured text of clinical notes in the EMR may more accurately identify mental illness and substance use among people living with HIV than structured EMR fields alone. Objective: The aim of this study was to utilize NLP of clinical notes to detect mental illness and substance use among people living with HIV and to determine how often these factors are documented in structured EMR fields. Methods: We collected both structured EMR data (diagnosis codes, social history, Problem List) as well as the unstructured text of clinical HIV care notes for adults living with HIV. We developed NLP algorithms to identify words and phrases associated with mental illness and substance use in the clinical notes. The algorithms were validated based on chart review. We compared numbers of patients with documentation of mental illness or substance use identified by structured EMR fields with those identified by the NLP algorithms. Results: The NLP algorithm for detecting mental illness had a positive predictive value (PPV) of 98% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 98%. The NLP algorithm for detecting substance use had a PPV of 92% and an NPV of 98%. The NLP algorithm for mental illness identified 54.0% (420/778) of patients as having documentation of mental illness in the text of clinical notes. Among the patients with mental illness detected by NLP, 58.6% (246/420) had documentation of mental illness in at least one structured EMR field. Sixty-three patients had documentation of mental illness in structured EMR fields that was not detected by NLP of clinical notes. The NLP algorithm for substance use detected substance use in the text of clinical notes in 18.1% (141/778) of patients. Among patients with substance use detected by NLP, 73.8% (104/141) had documentation of substance use in at least one structured EMR field. Seventy-six patients had documentation of substance use in structured EMR fields that was not detected by NLP of clinical notes.

Using Natural Language Processing on Electronic Health Records to Enhance Detection and Prediction of Psychosis Risk,"Irving, J.; Patel, R.; Oliver, D.; Colling, C.; Pritchard, M.; Broadbent, M.; Baldwin, H.; Stahl, D.; Stewart, R.; Fusar-Poli, P.","Background: Using novel data mining methods such as natural language processing (NLP) on electronic health records (EHRs) for screening and detecting individuals at risk for psychosis. Method: The study included all patients receiving a first index diagnosis of nonorganic and nonpsychotic mental disorder within the South London and Maudsley (SLaM) NHS Foundation Trust between January 1, 2008, and July 28, 2018. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)-regularized Cox regression was used to refine and externally validate a refined version of a five-item individualized, transdiagnostic, clinically based risk calculator previously developed (Harrell's C = 0.79) and piloted for implementation. The refined version included 14 additional NLP-predictors: tearfulness, poor appetite, weight loss, insomnia, cannabis, cocaine, guilt, irritability, delusions, hopelessness, disturbed sleep, poor insight, agitation, and paranoia. Results: A total of 92 151 patients with a first index diagnosis of nonorganic and nonpsychotic mental disorder within the SLaM Trust were included in the derivation (n = 28 297) or external validation (n = 63 854) data sets. Mean age was 33.6 years, 50.7% were women, and 67.0% were of white race/ethnicity. Mean follow-up was 1590 days. The overall 6-year risk of psychosis in secondary mental health care was 3.4 (95% CI, 3.3-3.6). External validation indicated strong performance on unseen data (Harrell's C 0.85, 95% CI 0.84-0.86), an increase of 0.06 from the original model.

Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19): Emotional Toll Analysis on Twitter,"Alowibdi, J.S.; Alshdadi, A.A.; Daud, A.; Dessouky, M.M.; Alhazmi, E.A.","People are afraid about COVID-19 and are actively talking about it on social media platforms such as Twitter. People are showing their emotions openly in their tweets on Twitter. It's very important to perform sentiment analysis on these tweets for finding COVID-19's impact on people's lives. Natural language processing, textual processing, computational linguists, and biometrics are applied to perform sentiment analysis to identify and extract the emotions. In this work, sentiment analysis is carried out on a large Twitter dataset of English tweets. Ten emotional themes are investigated. Experimental results show that COVID-19 has spread fear/anxiety, gratitude, happiness and hope, and other mixed emotions among people for different reasons. Specifically, it is observed that positive news from top officials like Trump of chloroquine as cure to COVID-19 has suddenly lowered fear in sentiment, and happiness, gratitude, and hope started to rise. But, once FDA said, chloroquine is not effective cure, fear again started to rise. © 2021 IGI Global.

Practical guidelines for intent recognition: BERT with minimal training data evaluated in real-world HRI application,"Huggins, M.; Alghowinem, S.; Jeong, S.; Colon-Hernandez, P.; Breazeal, C.; Park, H.W.","Intent recognition models, which match a written or spoken input's class in order to guide an interaction, are an essential part of modern voice user interfaces, chatbots, and social robots. However, getting enough data to train these models can be very expensive and challenging, especially when designing novel applications such as real-world human-robot interactions. In this work, wefi rst investigate how much training data is needed for high performance in an intent classification task. We train and evaluate BiLSTM and BERT models on various subsets of the ATIS and Snips datasets. Wefi nd that only 25 training examples per intent are required for our BERT model to achieve 94% intent accuracy compared to 98% with the entire datasets, challenging the belief that large amounts of labeled data are required for high performance in intent recognition. We apply this knowledge to train models for a real-world HRI application, character strength recognition during a positive psychology interaction with a social robot, and evaluate against the Character Strength dataset collected in our previous HRI study. Our real-world HRI application results also confirm that our model can produce 76% intent accuracy with 25 examples per intent compared to 80% with 100 examples. In a real-world scenario, the difference is only one additional error per 25 classifications. Finally, we investigate the limitations of our minimal data models and offer suggestions on developing high quality datasets. We conclude with practical guidelines for training BERT intent recognition models with minimal training data and make our code and evaluation framework available for others to replicate our results and easily develop models for their own applications. © 2021 IEEE Computer Society.

Age-Related Differences in Affective Norms for Chinese Words (AANC),"Liu, P.; Lu, Q.; Zhang, Z.; Tang, J.; Han, B.","Information on age-related differences in affective meanings of words is widely used by researchers to study emotions, word recognition, attention, memory, and text-based sentiment analysis. To date, no Chinese affective norms for older adults are available although Chinese as a spoken language has the largest population in the world. This article presents the first large-scale age-related affective norms for 2,061 four-character Chinese words (AANC). Each word in this database has rating values in the four dimensions, namely, valence, arousal, dominance, and familiarity. We found that older adults tended to perceive positive words as more arousing and less controllable and evaluate negative words as less arousing and more controllable than younger adults did. This indicates that the positivity effect is reliable for older adults who show a processing bias toward positive vs. negative words. Our AANC database supplies valuable information for researchers to study how emotional characteristics of words influence the cognitive processes and how this influence evolves with age. This age-related difference study on affective norms not only provides a tool for cognitive science, gerontology, and psychology in experimental studies but also serves as a valuable resource for affective analysis in various natural language processing applications. © Copyright © 2021 Liu, Lu, Zhang, Tang and Han.",2021,,Frontiers in Psychology,12,,,,10.3389/fpsyg.2021.585666,,#2083,Liu 2021,"",""

Nursing documentation of symptoms is associated with higher risk of emergency department visits and hospitalizations in homecare patients,"Topaz, M.; Koleck, T.A.; Onorato, N.; Smaldone, A.; Bakken, S.","Background: Nurses often document patient symptoms in narrative notes. Purpose: This study used a technique called natural language processing (NLP) to: (1) Automatically identify documentation of seven common symptoms (anxiety, cognitive disturbance, depressed mood, fatigue, sleep disturbance, pain, and well-being) in homecare narrative nursing notes, and (2) examine the association between symptoms and emergency department visits or hospital admissions from homecare. Method: NLP was applied on a large subset of narrative notes (2.5 million notes) documented for 89,825 patients admitted to one large homecare agency in the Northeast United States. Findings: NLP accurately identified symptoms in narrative notes. Patients with more documented symptom categories had higher risk of emergency department visit or hospital admission.

Towards facilitating empathic conversations in online mental health support: A reinforcement learning approach,"Sharma, A.; Lin, I.W.; Miner, A.S.; Atkins, D.C.; Althoff, T.","Online peer-to-peer support platforms enable conversations between millions of people who seek and provide mental health support. If successful, web-based mental health conversations could improve access to treatment and reduce the global disease burden. Psychologists have repeatedly demonstrated that empathy, the ability to understand and feel the emotions and experiences of others, is a key component leading to positive outcomes in supportive conversations. However, recent studies have shown that highly empathic conversations are rare in online mental health platforms. In this paper, we work towards improving empathy in online mental health support conversations. We introduce a new task of empathic rewriting which aims to transform low-empathy conversational posts to higher empathy. Learning such transformations is challenging and requires a deep understanding of empathy while maintaining conversation quality through text fluency and specificity to the conversational context. Here we propose Partner, a deep reinforcement learning (RL) agent that learns to make sentence-level edits to posts in order to increase the expressed level of empathy while maintaining conversation quality. Our RL agent leverages a policy network, based on a transformer language model adapted from GPT-2, which performs the dual task of generating candidate empathic sentences and adding those sentences at appropriate positions. During training, we reward transformations that increase empathy in posts while maintaining text fluency, context specificity, and diversity. Through a combination of automatic and human evaluation, we demonstrate that Partner successfully generates more empathic, specific, and diverse responses and outperforms NLP methods from related tasks such as style transfer and empathic dialogue generation. This work has direct implications for facilitating empathic conversations on web-based platforms.

A context-adaptive smoking cessation system using videos,"Asaeikheybari, G.; Hooper, M.W.; Huang, M.-C.","Cigarette smoking is the primary preventable cause of death and disease worldwide. Studies reveal that smoking is associated with psychiatric symptoms, sociodemographic characteristics, social stressors, and lack of social support. In general, smokers report poorer mental health and benefit from support to be able to quit smoking (Jorm et al., 1999). In this paper, a tailored smoking cessation system has been developed in which the counseling and support is delivered via video-messaging. The system engages users in adaptive motivating video access. Users can interact with the system and the system selects the best matching video for them by processing their messages using Natural Language Processing (NLP). We have tailored 77 videos for interactive contents that encompass important issues users might face during the process of smoking cessation. A novel application-based data driven approach has been taken for categorizing videos to push to participants. The approach is based on analyzing 750 messages of people in the cessation process. We observed that most of the messages’ contents were about smoking health effects, cravings, triggers, relapse, positive mood, low cessation self efficacy, medications, and culturally specific targeting inquiries. Considering these categories, videos are categorized to the corresponding groups by an intelligent approach. The information underlying the data driven categories allows for improving and facilitating smoking status assessment. The system has the potential for improving future smoking cessation decision-making adaptive interventions and health monitoring systems. The goal is to tailor the system to meet the needs of the users in real-time and maximize the potential impact. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2021,,Smart Health,19,,,,10.1016/j.smhl.2020.100148,,#2094,Asaeikheybari 2021,"",""

Results show that authors' psychological responses to peer reviews are complex and cannot be summarized by a single numerical rating directly given by the authors. Rejection invokes anger, sadness, and disagreement, but not anxiety. Fast turnaround arouses positive emotions from authors, but slow peer review processes do not increase negative emotions as much.

Social work and technology: Text mining three decades of scholarly literature (1985–2018),"Sinha, G.R.; Larrison, C.R.","Summary: While the scholarly literature is abound with discussions of technology and its proliferation in different social work domains, evidence about what types of technologies are being used in various social work practice domains remains limited. The present study aimed to identify the larger trends in how technology has permeated the profession. The study sample comprised of 892 articles from a journal known for its contribution in publishing research on technology use in human services. Two methods were used—topic modeling and human-assisted analyses. Topic modeling was performed using MALLET, a machine learning tool which employs latent Dirichlet allocation over a fixed vocabulary for the corpus of text. Human-assisted analyses were performed using QDA Miner and MS-Excel to assist in the manual analyses. Findings: In all, 29 topics in social work and 27 topics in technology domains were obtained. Social work education and mental health and clinical social work appeared as two of the top five social work domains in both topic modeling and human-assisted analyses. Management information system, communication technology, generic technology usage, and education technology were the top common topics in both types of analyses. Applications: The present study findings have two applications. First, the descriptive analysis of technology adoption across diverse social work areas of research provides the first concrete evidence of how technology has been spread throughout social work. Second, the patterns of technology adoption across social work practice fields indicate some fields have limited research regarding technology. © The Author(s) 2020.",2021,,Journal of Social Work,21,4,891-912,,10.1177/1468017320948333,,#2096,Sinha 2021,"",""
"Understanding concerns, sentiments, and disparities among population groups during the COVID-19 pandemic via twitter data mining: Large-scale cross-sectional study","Zhang, C.; Xu, S.; Li, Z.; Hu, S.","Background: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in late 2019, its far-reaching impacts have been witnessed globally across all aspects of human life, such as health, economy, politics, and education. Such widely penetrating impacts cast significant and profound burdens on all population groups, incurring varied concerns and sentiments among them. Objective: This study aims to identify the concerns, sentiments, and disparities of various population groups during the COVID-19 pandemic through a cross-sectional study conducted via large-scale Twitter data mining infoveillance. Methods: This study consisted of three steps: first, tweets posted during the pandemic were collected and preprocessed on a large scale; second, the key population attributes, concerns, sentiments, and emotions were extracted via a collection of natural language processing procedures; third, multiple analyses were conducted to reveal concerns, sentiments, and disparities among population groups during the pandemic. Overall, this study implemented a quick, effective, and economical approach for analyzing population-level disparities during a public health event. The source code developed in this study was released for free public use at GitHub. Results: A total of 1,015,655 original English tweets posted from August 7 to 12, 2020, were acquired and analyzed to obtain the following results. Organizations were significantly more concerned about COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 3.48, 95% CI 3.39-3.58) and expressed more fear and depression emotions than individuals. Females were less concerned about COVID-19 (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.71-0.75) and expressed less fear and depression emotions than males. Among all age groups (ie, ≤18, 19-29, 30-39, and ≥40 years of age), the attention ORs of COVID-19 fear and depression increased significantly with age. It is worth noting that not all females paid less attention to COVID-19 than males. In the age group of 40 years or older, females were more concerned than males, especially regarding the economic and education topics. In addition, males 40 years or older and 18 years or younger were the least positive. Lastly, in all sentiment analyses, the sentiment polarities regarding political topics were always the lowest among the five topics of concern across all population groups. Conclusions: Through large-scale Twitter data mining, this study revealed that meaningful differences regarding concerns and sentiments about COVID-19-related topics existed among population groups during the study period. Therefore, specialized and varied attention and support are needed for different population groups. In addition, the efficient analysis method implemented by our publicly released code can be utilized to dynamically track the evolution of each population group during the pandemic or any other major event for better informed public health research and interventions. © 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Natural language processing of clinical mental health notes may add predictive value to existing suicide risk models,"Levis, M.; Leonard Westgate, C.; Gui, J.; Watts, B.V.; Shiner, B.","Background This study evaluated whether natural language processing (NLP) of psychotherapy note text provides additional accuracy over and above currently used suicide prediction models. Methods We used a cohort of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) users diagnosed with post-Traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) between 2004-2013. Using a case-control design, cases (those that died by suicide during the year following diagnosis) were matched to controls (those that remained alive). After selecting conditional matches based on having shared mental health providers, we chose controls using a 5:1 nearest-neighbor propensity match based on the VHA's structured Electronic Medical Records (EMR)-based suicide prediction model. For cases, psychotherapist notes were collected from diagnosis until death. For controls, psychotherapist notes were collected from diagnosis until matched case's date of death. After ensuring similar numbers of notes, the final sample included 246 cases and 986 controls. Notes were analyzed using Sentiment Analysis and Cognition Engine, a Python-based NLP package. The output was evaluated using machine-learning algorithms. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated to determine models' predictive accuracy. Results NLP derived variables offered small but significant predictive improvement (AUC = 0.58) for patients that had longer treatment duration. A small sample size limited predictive accuracy. Conclusions Study identifies a novel method for measuring suicide risk over time and potentially categorizing patient subgroups with distinct risk sensitivities. Findings suggest leveraging NLP derived variables from psychotherapy notes offers an additional predictive value over and above the VHA's state-of-The-Art structured EMR-based suicide prediction model.

How do you speak about immigrants? Taxonomy and stereoimmigrants dataset for identifying stereotypes about immigrants,"Sánchez-Junquera, J.; Chulvi, B.; Rosso, P.; Ponzetto, S.P.","Stereotype is a type of social bias massively present in texts that computational models use. There are stereotypes that present special difficulties because they do not rely on personal attributes. This is the case of stereotypes about immigrants, a social category that is a preferred target of hate speech and discrimination. We propose a new approach to detect stereotypes about immigrants in texts focusing not on the personal attributes assigned to the minority but in the frames, that is, the narrative scenarios, in which the group is placed in public speeches. We have proposed a fine-grained social psychology grounded taxonomy with six categories to capture the different dimensions of the stereotype (positive vs. negative) and annotated a novel StereoImmigrants dataset with sentences that Spanish politicians have stated in the Congress of Deputies. We aggregate these categories in two supracategories: one is Victims that expresses the positive stereotypes about immigrants and the other is Threat that expresses the negative stereotype. We carried out two preliminary experiments: first, to evaluate the automatic detection of stereotypes; and second, to distinguish between the two supracategories of immigrants’ stereotypes. In these experiments, we employed state-of-the-art transformer models (monolingual and multilingual) and four classical machine learning classifiers. We achieve above 0.83 of accuracy with the BETO model in both experiments, showing that transformers can capture stereotypes about immigrants with a high level of accuracy. © 2021 by the authors.

Multiple-Choice Question Answering Models for Automatic Depression Severity Estimation †,"Gabín, J.; Pérez, A.; Parapar, J.","Depression is one of the most prevalent mental health diseases. Although there are effective treatments, the main problem relies on providing early and effective risk detection. Medical experts use self-reporting questionnaires to elaborate their diagnosis, but these questionnaires have some limitations. Social stigmas and the lack of awareness often negatively affect the success of these self-report questionnaires.

Future directions in natural language processing applications in smoking cessation therapy,"Prokop, J.","INTRODUCTION: Behavioural support has been shown to possess high efficacy in aiding smokers to stop smoking at a level at least similar to nicotine replacement therapies (NRT) while causing no adverse physiological effects. Furthermore, the effects of behavioural interventions and NRT appear to be roughly additive. The effectiveness of interventions appears to increase with the frequency of contact with an eHealth application, with daily contact showing higher efficacy compared to weekly sessions with a trained stop-smoking specialist. Previous automated counsellors based on a motivational interview approach, lapse preparation, and lapse management are rigid in their therapeutic path, with limited ability to reflect the needs and the specific situation of a given patient. AIMS: This report aims to describe a possible approach to developing a more engaging, patient-tailored automated counsellor based on recent advances in the natural language processing (NLP) field that should make remote chat-based counselling easier for professionals while gathering data for the NLP model, which should ultimately be able to conduct the therapy on its own. METHODS: The core of the approach lies in utilizing the Text-to-text transfer transformer (T5). T5 is, in essence, a set of neural network models aimed at tasks formulated as an expected textual response to a given textual input. These models can be utilized to – at first – suggest answers to counsellors in live chat sessions with patients. Actual answers from these sessions would subsequently be used to fine-tune the models and ultimately provide high-quality counselling without human intervention on the therapist’s side. CONCLUSION: The article presents a novel approach to internet-delivered smoking cessation cognitive-behavioural therapy utilizing a powerful artificial neural network NLP model acting as a conversational agent and a data collection protocol with usage incentives for both smoking cessation experts and smokers. © 2021, Sdruzeni SCAN.

The covid-19 crisis: An nlp exploration of the french twitter feed (february-may 2020),"Balech, S.; Benavent, C.; Calciu, M.; Monnot, J.","The Covid-19 pandemic offers a spectacular case of disaster management. In this literature, the paradigm of participation is fundamental: the mitigation of the impact of the disaster, the quality of the preparation and the resilience of the society, which facilitate the reconstruction, depend on the participation of the populations. Being able to observe and measure the state of mental health of the population (anx-iety, confidence, expectations, …) and to identify the points of controversy and the content of the discourse, are necessary to support measures designed to encourage this participation. Social media, and in particular Twitter, offer valuable resources for researching this discourse. The objective of this empirical study is to reconstruct a micro history of users’ reactions to the pandemic as they share them on social networks. The general method used comes from new processing techniques derived from Natural Language Processing (NLP). Three analysis methods are used to process the corpus: analysis of the temporal evolution of term occurrences; creation of dynamic semantic maps to identify co-occurrences; analysis of topics using the SVM method. The main empirical result is that the mask emerges as a central figure of discourse, at least in the discourse produced by certain social media. The retrospective analysis of the phenomenon allows us to explain what made the mask a focal point not only in conversation, but also in behaviors.

"Calculative practices, social movements and the rise of collective identity: how #istayathome mobilised a nation","La Torre, M.; Di Tullio, P.; Tamburro, P.; Massaro, M.; Rea, M.A.","Purpose: The Italian government addressed the first wave of its COVID-19 outbreak with a series of social restrictions and calculative practices, all branded with the slogan #istayathome. The hashtag quickly went viral, becoming both a mandate and a mantra and, as the crisis played out, we witnessed the rise of the Italian social movement #istayathome. This study examines how the government's calculative practices led to #istayathome and the constituents that shaped this social movement. Design/methodology/approach: The authors embrace social movement theory and the collective identity perspective to examine #istayathome as a collective action and social movement. Using passive netnography, text mining and interpretative text analysis enhanced by machine learning, the authors analysed just over 350,000 tweets made during the period March to May 2020, each brandishing the hashtag #istayathome. Findings: The #istayathome movement gained traction as a response to the Italian government's call for collective action. Thus, people became an active part of mobilising collective responsibility, enhancing the government's plans. A collective identity on the part of the Italian people sustained the mass mobilisation, driven by cohesion, solidarity and a deep cultural trauma from COVID-19's dramatic effects. Popular culture and Italy's long traditions also helped to form the collective identity of #istayathome. This study found that calculative practices acted as a persuasive technology in forming this collective identity and mobilising people's collective action. Numbers stimulated the cognitive, moral and emotional connections of the social ties shaping collective identity and responsibility. Thus, through collective identity, calculative practices indirectly influenced mass social behaviors and the social movement. Originality/value: This study offers a novel theoretical perspective and empirical knowledge to explain how government power affects people's culture and everyday life. It unveils the sociological drivers that mobilise collective behaviors and enriches the accounting literature on the effects of calculative practices in managing emergencies.

Development of NLP-Integrated Intelligent Web System for E-Mental Health,"Hassan, A.; Ali, M.D.I.; Ahammed, R.; Bourouis, S.; Khan, M.M.","As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the need for a better health care facility is highlighted more than ever. Besides physical health, mental health conditions have become a significant concern. Unfortunately, there are few opportunities for people to receive mental health care. There are inadequate facilities for seeking mental health support even in big cities, let alone remote areas. This paper presents the structure and implementation procedures for a mental health support system combining technology and professionals. The system is a web platform where mental health seekers can register and use functionalities like NLP-based chatbot for personality assessment, chatting with like-minded people, and one-to-one video conferencing with a mental health professional. The video calling feature of the system has emotion detection capabilities using computer vision. The system also includes downloadable prescription facilities and a payment gateway for secure transactions. From a technological aspect, the conversational NLP-based chatbot and computer vision-powered video calling are the system's most important features. The system has a documentation facility to analyze the mental health condition over time. The web platform is built using React.js for the frontend and Express.js for the backend. MongoDB is used as the database of the platform. The NLP chatbot is built on a three-layered deep neural network model that is programmed in the Python language and uses the NLTK, TensorFlow, and Keras sequential API. Video conference is one of the most important features of the platform. To create the video calling feature, Express.js, Socket.io, and Socket.io-client have been used. The emotion detection feature is implemented on video conferences using computer vision, Haar Cascade, and TensorFlow. All the implemented features are tested and work fine. The targeted users for the platform are teenagers, youth, and the middle-aged population. Mental health-seeking is still considered taboo in some societies today. Apart from basic established facilities, this social dilemma of undergoing treatment for mental health is causing severe damage to individuals. A solution to this problem can be a remote platform for mental health support. With this goal in mind, this system is designed to provide mental health support to people remotely from anywhere worldwide.  © 2021 Abid Hassan et al.",2021,,Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine,2021,,,,10.1155/2021/1546343,,#2149,Hassan 2021,"",""
Sentiment Analysis on the News to Improve Mental Health,"Kumar, S.; Jayant, R.; Charagulla, N.","The popularization of the internet created a revitalized digital media.

Availability and affordance of information communications technology has provided additional medium to monitor human rights violation. Reporting, extraction, collection and verification of reports through natural language processing and machine learning techniques can now be integrated into one system. The processed narratives becomes readily available for response, monitoring, interventions, policy-making and even as evidence in court. This paper discusses the design and development of wapr.tugon.ph, a block-chain enabled NLP-based platform that provides a simple yet effective way of reporting, validating and securing human rights violation reports from victims or witnesses. wapr.tugon.ph allows for SMS-based and web-based reporting of human rights violation. Reports are processed for detection of emotions using NRCLex, and behaviors using Stanford Parser and modified Multi-Liason algorithm from narratives which serve as input to assess wellness. A total of 5,418 records were obtained from Reddit’s subreddits and HappyDB corpus to serve as baseline corpora for our model. Our best psychosocial wellness detection model produced an accuracy and F1 score of 84% on validation set (n = 1, 426) and 87% on test set (n = 666). An ethereum private blockchain is implemented to record all transactions made in the system for authenticity tracking. Findings underscore the importance of providing a system that assists in determining the appropriate psychosocial intervention to victims, families and witnesses of human rights violation. Specifically, the study contributes a framework in embedding a combined sentiment and behavior model that outputs: sentiments that are used to assess mental wellness, behaviors that are used to assess physical needs, and detection of wellness that serves as input to refer victims, families of victims and witnesses to appropriate agencies. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.",2021,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),12720 LNCS,,235-244,,10.1007/978-3-030-80387-2_23,,#2158,Estuar 2021,"",""
A Method for MBTI Classification Based on Impact of Class Components,"Cerkez, N.; Vrdoljak, B.; Skansi, S.","Predicting the personality type of text authors has a well-known usage in psychology with practical applications in business. From the data science perspective, we can look at this problem as a text classification task that can be tackled using natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning. This paper proposes a method and a novel loss function for multiclass classification using the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) approach for predicting the author's personality type. Furthermore, this paper proposes an approach that improves the current results of the MBTI multiclass classification because it considers components of compound class labels as supportive elements for better classification according to MBTI. As such, it also provides a new perspective on this classification problem. The experimental results on long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) models outperform baseline models for multiclass classification, related research on multiclass classification, and most research with four binary approaches to MBTI classification. Moreover, other classification problems that target compound class labels and label parts with binary mutually exclusive values can benefit from this approach. © 2013 IEEE.",2021,,IEEE Access,9,,146550-146567,,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3121137,,#2161,Cerkez 2021,"",""
Research on the Fluctuation Characteristics of Social Media Message Sentiment with Time Before and During the COVID-19 Epidemic,"Guo, C.; Lin, S.; Huang, Z.; Shi, C.; Yao, Y.","“Tree hole” refers to a social media formed after the death of a social media user, in which other users continue to leave messages due to emotional resonance. This paper focuses on exploring the fluctuation of emotions with time in a “tree hole” of social media such as Microblog, and provides ideas and support for suicide warning, rescue, and user portraits of patients with depression in the “tree hole”. In this paper, the dataset of 2,356,066 messages captured from the “tree hole” Microblog with the “tree hole” agent (i.e., an AI program) and pre-processed. Subsequently, the effective dataset was labeled by a text sentiment analysis model based on BERT and BiLSTM, and accordingly the sentiment was scored. Then the scored data was visualized and analyzed in the time dimension. Finally, it was found that the sentiment of the “tree hole” messages reached a trough at 4:00 am and a peak around 8:00 am. In addition, the overall trend of “tree hole” sentiment has fluctuated downwards from Monday to Sunday. We have concluded that the sentiment of patients with depression fluctuates regularly at some special time points, and special events such as the outbreak of COVID-19 and so on, have a great impact on the emotions of patients with depression. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen warning and intervention for those who has expressed thoughts of suicide at special points to prevent the spread and fermentation of suicidal emotions in the “tree hole” in time. In addition, the rescue volunteers for patients with depression as Tree Hole Rescue Team should make corresponding adjustments to the rescue strategy when special events occur. This research is of great significance for the emergency response of “tree hole” depressed users in major events such as COVID-19 epidemic. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2021,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),13079 LNCS,,3-14,,10.1007/978-3-030-90885-0_1,,#2163,Guo 2021,"",""

Our contribution is threefold: using a dataset consisting of more illnesses than most studies, focusing on general text rather than mental health support groups and classification by posts rather than individuals or groups. For the automatic classification of the diseases,we employ three deeplearningmodels: BERT, RoBERTa and XLNET. We double the baseline established by Cohan et al. (2018), on just a sample of their dataset. We improve the results obtained by Jiang et al. (2020) on post-level classification.

Natural language processing and machine learning of electronic health records for prediction of first-time suicide attempts,"Tsui, F.R.; Shi, L.; Ruiz, V.; Ryan, N.D.; Biernesser, C.; Iyengar, S.; Walsh, C.G.; Brent, D.A.","Objective: Limited research exists in predicting first-time suicide attempts that account for two-thirds of suicide decedents. We aimed to predict first-time suicide attempts using a large data-driven approach that applies natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to unstructured (narrative) clinical notes and structured electronic health record (EHR) data. Methods: This case-control study included patients aged 10-75 years who were seen between 2007 and 2016 from emergency departments and inpatient units. Cases were first-time suicide attempts from coded diagnosis; controls were randomly selected without suicide attempts regardless of demographics, following a ratio of nine controls per case. Four data-driven ML models were evaluated using 2-year historical EHR data prior to suicide attempt or control index visits, with prediction windows from 7 to 730 days. Patients without any historical notes were excluded. Model evaluation on accuracy and robustness was performed on a blind dataset (30% cohort). Results: The study cohort included 45 238 patients (5099 cases, 40 139 controls) comprising 54 651 variables from 5.7 million structured records and 798 665 notes. Using both unstructured and structured data resulted in significantly greater accuracy compared to structured data alone (area-under-the-curve [AUC]: 0.932 vs. 0.901 P <. 001). The best-predicting model utilized 1726 variables with AUC = 0.932 (95% CI, 0.922-0.941). The model was robust across multiple prediction windows and subgroups by demographics, points of historical most recent clinical contact, and depression diagnosis history. Conclusions: Our large data-driven approach using both structured and unstructured EHR data demonstrated accurate and robust first-time suicide attempt prediction, and has the potential to be deployed across various populations and clinical settings.  © 2021 The Author(s).",2021,,JAMIA Open,4,1,,,10.1093/jamiaopen/ooab011,,#2197,Tsui 2021,"",""

Sustainability planning in the US response to the opioid crisis: An examination using expert and text mining approaches,"Gallo, C.; Abram, K.; Hannah, N.; Caton, L.; Cimaglio, B.; McGovern, M.; Brown, C.H.","Between January 2016 and June 2020, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration rapidly distributed $7.5 billion in response to the U.S. opioid crisis. These funds are designed to increase access to medications for addiction treatment, reduce unmet treatment need, reduce overdose death rates, and provide and sustain effective prevention, treatment and recovery activities. It is unclear whether or not the services developed using these funds will be sustained beyond the start-up period. Based on 34 (64%) State Opioid Response (SOR) applications, we assessed the states’ sustainability plans focusing on potential funding sources, policies, and quality monitoring. We found variable commitment to sustainability across response plans with less than half the states adequately describing sustainability plans. States with higher proportions of opioid prescribing, opioid misuse, and poverty had somewhat higher scores on sustainment. A text mining/ machine learning approach automatically rated sustainability in SOR applications with an 82% accuracy compared to human ratings. Because life saving evidence-based programs and services may be lost, intentional commitment to sustainment beyond the bolus of startup funding is essential. © 2021 Gallo et al.

Antipsychotic use in dementia: the relationship between neuropsychiatric symptom profiles and adverse outcomes,"Mueller, C.; John, C.; Perera, G.; Aarsland, D.; Ballard, C.; Stewart, R.","Antipsychotic treatments are associated with safety concerns in people with dementia. The authors aimed to investigate whether risk of adverse outcomes related to antipsychotic prescribing differed according to major neuropsychiatric syndromes—specifically psychosis, agitation, or a combination. A cohort of 10,106 patients with a diagnosis of dementia was assembled from a large dementia care database in South East London. Neuropsychiatric symptoms closest to first dementia diagnosis were determined according to the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales’ mental and behavioural problem scores and the sample was divided into four groups: ‘agitation and psychosis’, ‘agitation, but no psychosis’, ‘psychosis, but no agitation’, and ‘neither psychosis nor agitation’. Antipsychotic prescription in a one-year window around first dementia diagnosis was ascertained as exposure variable through natural language processing from free text. Cox regression models were used to analyse associations of antipsychotic prescription with all-cause and stroke-specific mortality, emergency hospitalisation and hospitalised stroke adjusting for sixteen potential confounders including demographics, cognition, functioning, as well as physical and mental health. Only in the group ‘psychosis, but no agitation’ (n = 579), 30% of whom were prescribed an antipsychotic, a significant antipsychotic-associated increased risk of hospitalised stroke was present after adjustment (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 2.16; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09–4.25). An increased antipsychotic-related all-cause (adjusted HR 1.14; 95% CI 1.04–1.24) and stroke-specific mortality risk (adjusted HR 1.28; 95% CI 1.01–1.63) was detected in the whole sample, but no interaction between the strata and antipsychotic-related mortality. In conclusion, the adverse effects of antipsychotics in dementia are complex. Stroke risk may be highest when used in patients presenting with psychosis without agitation, indicating the need for novel interventions for this group. © 2020, The Author(s).",2021,,European Journal of Epidemiology,36,1,89-101,,10.1007/s10654-020-00643-2,,#2208,Mueller 2021,"",""
Development of a predictive model for retention in HIV care using natural language processing of clinical notes,"Oliwa, T.; Furner, B.; Schmitt, J.; Schneider, J.; Ridgway, J.P.","Objective: Adherence to a treatment plan from HIV-positive patients is necessary to decrease their mortality and improve their quality of life, however some patients display poor appointment adherence and become lost to follow-up (LTFU). We applied natural language processing (NLP) to analyze indications towards or against LTFU in HIV-positive patients' notes. Materials and Methods: Unstructured lemmatized notes were labeled with an LTFU or Retained status using a 183-day threshold. An NLP and supervised machine learning system with a linear model and elastic net regularization was trained to predict this status. Prevalence of characteristics domains in the learned model weights were evaluated. Results: We analyzed 838 LTFU vs 2964 Retained notes and obtained a weighted F1 mean of 0.912 via nested cross-validation; another experiment with notes from the same patients in both classes showed substantially lower metrics. ""Comorbidities""were associated with LTFU through, for instance, ""HCV""(hepatitis C virus) and likewise ""Good adherence""with Retained, represented with ""Well on ART""(antiretroviral therapy). Discussion: Mentions of mental health disorders and substance use were associated with disparate retention outcomes, however history vs active use was not investigated. There remains further need to model transitions between LTFU and being retained in care over time. Conclusion: We provided an important step for the future development of a model that could eventually help to identify patients who are at risk for falling out of care and to analyze which characteristics could be factors for this.

Identifying #addiction concerns on twitter during the COVID-19 pandemic: A text mining analysis,"Glowacki, E.M.; Wilcox, G.B.; Glowacki, J.B.","Background: The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) is responsible for thousands of deaths and hospitalizations. To curb the spread of this highly transmissible disease, governments enacted protective guidelines for its citizens, including social distancing and stay-at-home orders. These restrictions on social interactions can be especially problematic for individuals managing or recovering from addiction given that treatment often involves access to services and resources that became limited or even unavailable at this time. Social media sites like Twitter serve as a space for users to post questions and concerns about timely topics and allow for researchers to track common themes among the public. The goal of this study was to identify how the public was discussing addiction on Twitter during the COVID pandemic. Methods: We performed a text mining analysis to analyze tweets that contained “addiction” and “covid” to capture posts from the public that illustrated comments and concerns about addiction during the COVID-19 pandemic. We report on 3,301 tweets captured between January 31 and April 23, 2020. The study was conducted in the United States, but contained tweets from multiple countries. Results: The most prevalent topics had to do with services offered by Acadia Healthcare and Serenity Healthcare Centers, attempts to manage time while home, difficulties of coping with alcoholism amidst rising sales of alcohol, and attention to ongoing health crises (e.g.,., opioids, vaping). Additional topics included affordable telehealth services, research from France on the relationship between nicotine and COVID-19, concerns about gambling addiction, and changing patterns in substance misuse as drug availability varies. Conclusions: Analyzing Twitter content enables health professionals to identify the public’s concerns about addiction during the COVID-19 pandemic.

An evaluation of symptom domains in the 2 years before pregnancy as predictors of relapse in the perinatal period in women with severe mental illness,"Khapre, S.; Stewart, R.; Taylor, C.","Background. Symptoms may be more useful prognostic markers for mental illness than diagnoses. We sought to investigate symptom domains in women with pre-existing severe mental illness (SMI; psychotic and bipolar disorder) as predictors of relapse risk during the perinatal period. Methods. Data were obtained from electronic health records of 399 pregnant women with SMI diagnoses from a large south London mental healthcare provider. Symptoms within six domains characteristically associated with SMI (positive, negative, disorganization, mania, depression, and catatonia) recorded in clinical notes 2 years before pregnancy were identified with natural language processing algorithms to extract data from text, and associations investigated with hospitalization during pregnancy and 3 months postpartum. Results. Seventy-six women (19%) relapsed during pregnancy and 107 (27%) relapsed postpartum. After adjusting for covariates, disorganization symptoms showed a positive association at borderline significance with relapse during pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.36; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.99–1.87 per unit increase in number of symptoms) and depressive symptoms negatively with relapse postpartum (0.78; 0.62–0.98). Restricting the sample to women with at least one recorded symptom in any given domain, higher disorganization (1.84; 1.22–2.76), positive (1.50; 1.07–2.11), and manic (1.48; 1.03–2.11) symptoms were associated with relapse during pregnancy, and disorganization (1.54; 1.08–2.20) symptom domains were associated with relapse postpartum. Conclusions. Positive, disorganization, and manic symptoms recorded in the 2 years before pregnancy were associated with increased risk of relapse during pregnancy and postpartum.

Analyzing profile data from personal social media accounts reduces data collection time, as this method does not require users to fill any questionnaires. A pure natural language processing (NLP) approach can give decent results, and its reliability can be improved by combining it with machine learning (as shown by previous studies). Design/methodology/approach: In this, cleaning the dataset and extracting relevant potential features “as assessed by psychological experts” are essential, as Indonesians tend to mix formal words, non-formal words, slang and abbreviations when writing social media posts. For this article, raw data were derived from a predefined dominance, influence, stability and conscientious (DISC) quiz website, returning 316,967 tweets from 1,244 Twitter accounts “filtered to include only personal and Indonesian-language accounts”. Using a combination of NLP techniques and machine learning, the authors aim to develop a better approach and more robust model, especially for the Indonesian language.

LAW-U: Legal Guidance through Artificial Intelligence Chatbot for Sexual Violence Victims and Survivors,"Socatiyanurak, V.; Klangpornkun, N.; Munthuli, A.; Phienphanich, P.; Kovudhikulrungsri, L.; Saksakulkunakorn, N.; Chairaungsri, P.; Tantibundhit, C.","Sexual violence is a severe and chronic occurrence around the world that has not been resolved. The stigmatized nature of sexual violence has forced victims and survivors to accept prejudiced accusations cultivated from discriminatory norms when they are never at fault nor responsible for such violations against their sexuality. LAW-U is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbot that gives legal guidance to survivors of sexual violence by recommending the most relevant Supreme Court decisions to the survivors' situations. In Thai, 'LAW-U' - pronounced similarly to ' ' - means 'I will wait for you', which signifies the chatbot's unconditional support to the user. 182 Thai Supreme Court cases of sexual violence, relating to Sections 276, 277, 278, and 279 of the Criminal Code, were used to develop Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipelines for LAW-U. Legal experts then generated mock-up dialogs from Supreme Court decisions which became the conversations used to train LAW-U.

A Comparative NLP-Based Study on the Current Trends and Future Directions in COVID-19 Research,"Bose, P.; Roy, S.; Ghosh, P.","COVID-19 is a global health crisis that has altered human life and still promises to create ripples of death and destruction in its wake. The sea of scientific literature published over a short time-span to understand and mitigate this global phenomenon necessitates concerted efforts to organize our findings and focus on the unexplored facets of the disease. In this work, we applied natural language processing (NLP) based approaches on scientific literature published on COVID-19 to infer significant keywords that have contributed to our social, economic, demographic, psychological, epidemiological, clinical, and medical understanding of this pandemic. We identify key terms appearing in COVID literature that vary in representation when compared to other virus-borne diseases such as MERS, Ebola, and Influenza. We also identify countries, topics, and research articles that demonstrate that the scientific community is still reacting to the short-term threats such as transmissibility, health risks, treatment plans, and public policies, underpinning the need for collective international efforts towards long-term immunization and drug-related challenges. Furthermore, our study highlights several long-term research directions that are urgently needed for COVID-19 such as: global collaboration to create international open-access data repositories, policymaking to curb future outbreaks, psychological repercussions of COVID-19, vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 variants and their long-term efficacy studies, and mental health issues in both children and elderly.  © 2013 IEEE.",2021,,IEEE Access,9,,78341-78355,,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3082108,,#2235,Bose 2021,"",""
CrawlBot: A Domain-Specific Pseudonymous Crawler,"Shinde, V.; Dhotre, S.; Gavde, V.; Dalvi, A.; Kazi, F.; Bhirud, S.G.","The Dark Net, a dark side of the internet, became a perfect hosting ground for criminal activities and services, including significant drug marketplaces, child and women sexual abuse, forged documents, homemade explosives, and likewise. The nature of the Dark Net makes it indifferent to searching through the indexed mechanism. Diverse approaches are suggested and attempted to gain useful insights from the Dark Net. In this paper, a focused crawling framework for uncovering material of child and women abuse that lies in the Surface and the Dark Net is proposed. A focused crawler is domain-specific and trained to selectively retrieve web pages that are related to a given domain from the Internet. One of the novel attributes of the crawler is traversing the Surface Net and the Dark Net in a pseudonymous way. During a single crawl session, it automatically selects hyperlinks, which are most likely to give related web pages and downloads pages that are relevant. The hyperlink selection method uses anchor text and local context of the hyperlink as a feature vector. Numerous web data mining and classification tasks utilize local contexts of hyperlinks. Focused or Topical crawlers have a major dependence on local contexts of hyperlinks. The relevancy of the page and hyperlinks is calculated using natural language processing and a sophisticated Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based classifier.

PRERONA is designed to help depression struggling people especially for Bengali users who are lack attention and have none to talk about their problem. The main objective of this chatbot PRERONA is to give instant answers to questions and queries as well as to provide proper mental health care to Bengali’s in times of depression. Although our bot PRERONA is made only for Bengali users, we have it in multiple languages such as Bengali, English and Korean. In addition to that, we are using adaptive learning process. If the bot can not answer any questions, that will be recorded as well as added to that database later on for more accuracy.

When depressed, people's feelings tend to be more evident, affecting how users interact and demonstrating their feelings on social media. This paper presents a new approach for the temporal assessment of emotional behavior and interaction among depressed users on social networks. We start by modeling user interactions using complex networks, grouping users through time using the Clauset-Newman-Moore greedy modularity maximization. We evaluate the built networks using metrics such as assortativity, density, clustering, diameter, and shortest path length, closeness, and coverage. Then, we propose EMUS, a method for establishing an emotional user score based on the extraction of emotional features in texts of posts and comments. To extract emotional features, we combine the use of the Empath framework and VADER lexicon. Finally, based on the standard deviation among users, we establish a metric for assessing mood levels. We evaluated users for 33 days, and the results show a sequence of mixed emotional behaviors with high correlations between the number of active users in the network communities, and the form and quality of interactions. The developed approach can be further applied to other database graphs, for different sequential pattern analysis and text-mining contexts.  © 2013 IEEE.",2021,,IEEE Access,9,,93182-93194,,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3091801,,#2241,Giuntini 2021,"",""
Lux: Smart mirror with sentiment analysis for mental comfort,"Yu, H.; Bae, J.; Choi, J.; Kim, H.","As COVID-19 solidifies its presence in everyday life, the interest in mental health is growing, resulting in the necessity of sentiment analysis. A smart mirror is suitable for encouraging mental comfort due to its approachability and scalability as an in-home AI device. From the aspect of natural language processing (NLP), sentiment analysis for Korean lacks an emotion dataset regarding everyday conversation. Its significant differences from English in terms of language structure make implementation challenging. The proposed smart mirror LUX provides Korean text sentiment analysis with the deep learning model, which examines GRU, LSTM, CNN, Bi-LSTM, and Bi-GRU networks. There are four emotional labels: anger, sadness, neutral, and happiness. For each emotion, there are three possible interactive responses: reciting wise sayings, playing music, and sympathizing. The implemented smart mirror also includes more-typical functions, such as a wake-up prompt, a weather reporting function, a calendar, a news reporting function, and a clock. © 2021 by the authors.

Evaluation of Different Word Embeddings to Create Personality Models in Spanish,"López-Pabón, F.O.; Orozco-Arroyave, J.R.","Research in psychology has shown that personality directly influences the way people think, feel and communicate. It also has consequences on behavior and indirectly affects work effectiveness and job performance. Automatic personality assessment has gained attention in the last decade, and one of the most common models in psychology for automatic personality analysis is the Big Five model, also called as OCEAN model. Different works that study personality traits are based on English texts; conversely, very few studies focus on creating Spanish models. This paper proposes a methodology for the automatic modeling of personality in Spanish texts. Transliterations of videos from YouTube are translated to Spanish to create and evaluate the models. Classical word embeddings are considered, including Wor2Vec, GloVe, BERT, and BETO. Classification and regression experiments are performed to predict the labels of the five traits in the OCEAN model. The results show that 3 out of the five traits can be predicted with high reliability. Additionally, embeddings created with transformer-based models (i.e., BERT and BETO) yield the highest accuracies. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2021,,Communications in Computer and Information Science,1431 CCIS,,121-132,,10.1007/978-3-030-86702-7_11,,#2247,López-Pabón 2021,"",""
Deep Learning for Suicide and Depression Identification with Unsupervised Label Correction,"Haque, A.; Reddi, V.; Giallanza, T.","Early detection of suicidal ideation in depressed individuals can allow for adequate medical attention and support, which can be life-saving. Recent NLP research focuses on classifying, from given text, if an individual is suicidal or clinically healthy. However, there have been no major attempts to differentiate between depression and suicidal ideation, which is a separate and important clinical challenge. Due to the scarce availability of EHR data, suicide notes, or other verified sources, web query data has emerged as a promising alternative. Online sources, such as Reddit, allow for anonymity, prompting honest disclosure of symptoms, making it a plausible source even in a clinical setting. However, online datasets also result in inherent noise in web-scraped labels, which necessitates a noise-removal process to improve performance. Thus, we propose SDCNL, a deep neural network approach for suicide versus depression classification. We utilize online content to train our algorithm, and to verify and correct noisy labels, we propose a novel unsupervised label correction method which, unlike previous work, does not require prior noise distribution information. Our extensive experimentation with various deep word embedding models and classifiers display strong performance of SDCNL as a new clinical application for a challenging problem (We make our supplemental, dataset, web-scraping script, and code (with hyperparameters) available at https://github.com/ayaanzhaque/SDCNL ). © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2021,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),12895 LNCS,,436-447,,10.1007/978-3-030-86383-8_35,,#2253,Haque 2021,"",""

Natural language processing-based virtual cofacilitator for online cancer support groups: Protocol for an algorithm development and validation study,"Leung, Y.W.; Wouterloot, E.; Adikari, A.; Hirst, G.; de Silva, D.; Wong, J.; Bender, J.L.; Gancarz, M.; Gratzer, D.; Alahakoon, D.; Esplen, M.J.","Background: Cancer and its treatment can significantly impact the short- and long-term psychological well-being of patients and families. Emotional distress and depressive symptomatology are often associated with poor treatment adherence, reduced quality of life, and higher mortality. Cancer support groups, especially those led by health care professionals, provide a safe place for participants to discuss fear, normalize stress reactions, share solidarity, and learn about effective strategies to build resilience and enhance coping. However, in-person support groups may not always be accessible to individuals; geographic distance is one of the barriers for access, and compromised physical condition (eg, fatigue, pain) is another. Emerging evidence supports the effectiveness of online support groups in reducing access barriers. Text-based and professional-led online support groups have been offered by Cancer Chat Canada. Participants join the group discussion using text in real time. However, therapist leaders report some challenges leading text-based online support groups in the absence of visual cues, particularly in tracking participant distress. With multiple participants typing at the same time, the nuances of the text messages or red flags for distress can sometimes be missed. Recent advances in artificial intelligence such as deep learning-based natural language processing offer potential solutions. This technology can be used to analyze online support group text data to track participants' expressed emotional distress, including fear, sadness, and hopelessness. Artificial intelligence allows session activities to be monitored in real time and alerts the therapist to participant disengagement. Objective: We aim to develop and evaluate an artificial intelligence-based cofacilitator prototype to track and monitor online support group participants' distress through real-time analysis of text-based messages posted during synchronous sessions. Methods: An artificial intelligence-based cofacilitator will be developed to identify participants who are at-risk for increased emotional distress and track participant engagement and in-session group cohesion levels, providing real-time alerts for therapist to follow-up; generate postsession participant profiles that contain discussion content keywords and emotion profiles for each session; and automatically suggest tailored resources to participants according to their needs. The study is designed to be conducted in 4 phases consisting of (1) development based on a subset of data and an existing natural language processing framework, (2) performance evaluation using human scoring, (3) beta testing, and (4) user experience evaluation. Results: This study received ethics approval in August 2019. Phase 1, development of an artificial intelligence-based cofacilitator, was completed in January 2020. As of December 2020, phase 2 is underway. The study is expected to be completed by September 2021. Conclusions: An artificial intelligence-based cofacilitator offers a promising new mode of delivery of person-centered online support groups tailored to individual needs.

Coping With Imbalanced Data in the Automated Detection of Reminiscence From Everyday Life Conversations of Older Adults,"Stoev, T.; Ferrario, A.; Demiray, B.; Luo, M.; Martin, M.; Yordanova, K.","Reminiscence-the act of recalling or telling others about relevant personal past experiences- plays an important role in the well-being of older adults. Therefore, it is relevant to develop intelligent systems aiming at improving the well-being of the elderly by reliably detecting reminiscence in their everyday life conversations. Data imbalance is one of the main challenges in the automatic detection of reminiscence from everyday conversations, as reminiscing is a rare event. In this paper, we address the problem by proposing a methodology for coping with imbalanced data in the detection of reminiscence in conversations of older adults. The methodology combines data augmentation using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer) and feature extraction techniques leveraging natural language processing for the German language. We evaluate the proposed methodology on a dataset comprising transcripts of social conversations of older adults held in German. We compare our results with a previous work addressing the problem on the same dataset and we show that our approach strongly outperforms the baseline.

Analysis of the supportive care needs of the parents of preterm children in South Korea using big data text-mining: Topic modeling,"Park, J.H.; Lee, H.; Cho, H.","Purpose: The purpose of this study was to identify the supportive care needs of parents of preterm children in South Korea using text data from a portal site. Methods: In total, 628 online newspaper articles and 1,966 social network service posts published between January 1 and December 31, 2019 were analyzed. The procedures in this study were conducted in the following order: keyword selection, data collection, morpheme analysis, keyword analysis, and topic modeling. Results: The term ""yirundung-yi"", which is a native Korean word referring to premature infants, was confirmed to be a useful term for parents. The following four topics were identified as the supportive care needs of parents of preterm children: 1) a vague fear of caring for a baby upon imminent neonatal intensive care unit discharge, 2) real-world difficulties encountered while caring for preterm children, 3) concerns about growth and development problems, and 4) anxiety about possible complications. Conclusion: Supportive care interventions for parents of preterm children should include general parenting methods for babies.

Impact of unreliable content on social media users during COVID-19 and stance detection system,"Wani, M.A.; Agarwal, N.; Bours, P.","The abundant dissemination of misinformation regarding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents another unprecedented issue to the world, along with the health crisis. Online social network (OSN) platforms intensify this problem by allowing their users to easily distort and fabri-cate the information and disseminate it farther and rapidly. In this paper, we study the impact of misinformation associated with a religious inflection on the psychology and behavior of the OSN users. The article presents a detailed study to understand the reaction of social media users when exposed to unverified content related to the Islamic community during the COVID-19 lockdown period in India. The analysis was carried out on Twitter users where the data were collected using three scraping packages, Tweepy, Selenium, and Beautiful Soup, to cover more users affected by this misinformation. A labeled dataset is prepared where each tweet is assigned one of the four reaction polarities, namely, E (endorse), D (deny), Q (question), and N (neutral). Analysis of collected data was carried out in five phases where we investigate the engagement of E, D, Q, and N users, tone of the tweets, and the consequence upon repeated exposure of such information. The evidence demonstrates that the circulation of such content during the pandemic and lockdown phase had made people more vulnerable in perceiving the unreliable tweets as fact. It was also observed that people absorbed the negativity of the online content, which induced a feeling of hatred, anger, distress, and fear among them. People with similar mindset form online groups and express their negative attitude to other groups based on their opinions, indicating the strong signals of social unrest and public tensions in society. The paper also presents a deep learning-based stance detection model as one of the automated mechanisms for tracking the news on Twitter as being potentially false. Stance classifier aims to predict the attitude of a tweet towards a news headline and thereby assists in determining the veracity of news by monitoring the distribution of different reactions of the users towards it. The proposed model, employing deep learning (convolutional neural network (CNN)) and sentence embedding (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT)) techniques, outperforms the existing systems. The performance is evaluated on the benchmark SemEval stance dataset. Furthermore, a newly annotated dataset is prepared and released with this study to help the research of this domain. © 2020 by the authors.

Using natural language processing to classify social work interventions,"Bako, A.T.; Taylor, H.L.; Wiley, K.; Zheng, J.; Walter-McCabe, H.; Kasthurirathne, S.N.; Vest, J.R.","OBJECTIVES: Health care organizations are increasingly employing social workers to address patients' social needs. However, social work (SW) activities in health care settings are largely captured as text data within electronic health records (EHRs), making measurement and analysis difficult. This study aims to extract and classify, from EHR notes, interventions intended to address patients' social needs using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) algorithms. STUDY DESIGN: Secondary data analysis of a longitudinal cohort. METHODS: We extracted 815 SW encounter notes from the EHR system of a federally qualified health center. We reviewed the literature to derive a 10-category classification scheme for SW interventions. We applied NLP and ML algorithms to categorize the documented SW interventions in EHR notes according to the 10-category classification scheme. RESULTS: Most of the SW notes (n = 598; 73.4%) contained at least 1 SW intervention. The most frequent interventions offered by social workers included care coordination (21.5%), education (21.0%), financial planning (18.5%), referral to community services and organizations (17.1%), and supportive counseling (15.3%). High-performing classification algorithms included the kernelized support vector machine (SVM) (accuracy, 0.97), logistic regression (accuracy, 0.96), linear SVM (accuracy, 0.95), and multinomial naive Bayes classifier (accuracy, 0.92). CONCLUSIONS: NLP and ML can be utilized for automated identification and classification of SW interventions documented in EHRs. Health care administrators can leverage this automated approach to gain better insight into the most needed social interventions in the patient population served by their organizations. Such information can be applied in managerial decisions related to SW staffing, resource allocation, and patients' social needs. © 2021 Ascend Media.

Un-Compromised Credibility: Social Media Based Multi-Class Hate Speech Classification for Text,"Qureshi, K.A.; Sabih, M.","There is an enormous growth of social media which fully promotes freedom of expression through its anonymity feature. Freedom of expression is a human right but hate speech towards a person or group based on race, caste, religion, ethnic or national origin, sex, disability, gender identity, etc. is an abuse of this sovereignty. It seriously promotes violence or hate crimes and creates an imbalance in society by damaging peace, credibility, and human rights, etc. Detecting hate speech in social media discourse is quite essential but a complex task. There are different challenges related to appropriate and social media-specific dataset availability and its high-performing supervised classifier for text-based hate speech detection. These issues are addressed in this study, which includes the availability of social media-specific broad and balanced dataset, with multi-class labels and its respective automatic classifier, a dataset with language subtleties, dataset labeled under a comprehensive definition and well-defined rules, dataset labeled with the strong agreement of annotators, etc. Addressing different categories of hate separately, this paper aims to accurately predict their different forms, by exploring a group of text mining features. Two distinct groups of features are explored for problem suitability. These are baseline features and self-discovered/new features. Baseline features include the most commonly used effective features of related studies. Exploration found a few of them, like character and word n-grams, dependency tuples, sentiment scores, and count of 1st, 2nd person pronouns are more efficient than others. Due to the application of latent semantic analysis (LSA) for dimensionality reduction, this problem is benefited from the utilization of many complex and non-linear models and CAT Boost performed best. The proposed model is compared with related studies in addition to system baseline models. The results produced by the proposed model were much appreciating.  © 2013 IEEE.",2021,,IEEE Access,9,,109465-109477,,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3101977,,#2282,Qureshi 2021,"",""

Epidemiology of Functional Seizures Among Adults Treated at a University Hospital,"Goleva, S.B.; Lake, A.M.; Torstenson, E.S.; Haas, K.F.; Davis, L.K.","Importance: Functional seizures (formerly psychogenic nonepileptic seizures), paroxysmal episodes that are often similar to epileptic seizures in their clinical presentation and display no aberrant brain electrical patterns, are understudied. Patients experience a long diagnostic delay, few treatment modalities, a high rate of comorbidities, and significant stigma due to the lack of knowledge about functional seizures. Objective: To characterize the clinical epidemiology of a population of patients with functional seizures observed at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC). Design, Setting, and Participants: This case-control study included patients with functional seizures identified in the VUMC electronic health record (VUMC-EHR) system from October 1989 to October 2018. Patients with epilepsy were excluded from the study and all remaining patients in the VUMC medical center system were used as controls. In total, the study included 1431 patients diagnosed with functional seizures, 2251 with epilepsy and functional seizures, 4715 with epilepsy without functional seizures, and 502200 control patients who received treatment at VUMC for a minimum of a 3 years. Data were analyzed from November 2018 to March 2020. Exposure: Diagnosis of functional seizures, as identified from the VUMC-EHR system by an automated phenotyping algorithm that incorporated International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes, International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes, Current Procedural Terminology codes, and natural language processing. Main Outcomes and Measures: Associations of functional seizures with comorbidities and risk factors, measured in odds ratios (ORs). Results: Of 2346808 total patients in the VUMC-EHR aged 18 years or older, 3341 patients with functional seizures were identified (period prevalence, 0.14%), 1062 (74.2%) of whom were women and for which the median (interquartile range) age was 49.3 (39.4-59.9) years. This assessment replicated previously reported associations with psychiatric disorders including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.21-1.24; P < 3.02 × 10-5), anxiety (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.13-1.15; P < 3.02 × 10-5), and depression (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.13-1.15; P < 3.02 × 10-5), and identified novel associations with cerebrovascular disease (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.06-1.09; P < 3.02 × 10-5). An association was found between functional seizures and the known risk factor sexual assault trauma (OR, 10.26; 95% CI, 10.09-10.44; P < 3.02 × 10-5), and sexual assault trauma was found to mediate nearly a quarter of the association between female sex and functional seizures in the VUMC-EHR. Conclusions and Relevance: This case-control study found evidence to support previously reported associations, discovered new associations between functional seizures and PTSD, anxiety, and depression. An association between cerebrovascular disease and functional seizures was also found. Results suggested that sexual trauma may be a mediating factor in the association between female sex and functional seizures. © 2020 American Medical Association.

Mining news media for understanding public health concerns,"Zolnoori, M.; Huang, M.; Patten, C.A.; Balls-Berry, J.E.; Goudarzvand, S.; Brockman, T.A.; Sagheb, E.; Yao, L.","Introduction: News media play an important role in raising public awareness, framing public opinions, affecting policy formulation, and acknowledgment of public health issues. Traditional qualitative content analysis for news sentiments and focuses are time-consuming and may not efficiently convey sentiments nor the focuses of news media. Methods: We used descriptive statistics and state-of-art text mining to conduct sentiment analysis and topic modeling, to efficiently analyze over 3 million Reuters news articles during 2007–2017 for identifying their coverage, sentiments, and focuses for public health issues. Based on the top keywords from public health scientific journals, we identified 10 major public health issues (i.e., “air pollution,” “alcohol drinking,” “asthma,” “depression,” “diet,” “exercise,” “obesity,” “pregnancy,” “sexual behavior,” and “smoking”). Results: The news coverage for seven public health issues, “Smoking,” “Exercise,” “Alcohol drinking,” “Diet,” “Obesity,” “Depression,” and “Asthma” decreased over time. The news coverage for “Sexual behavior,” “Pregnancy,” and “Air pollution” fluctuated during 2007–2017. The sentiments of the news articles for three of the public health issues, “exercise,” “alcohol drinking,” and “diet” were predominately positive and associated such as “energy.” Sentiments for the remaining seven public health issues were mainly negative, linked to negative terms, e.g., diseases. The results of topic modeling reflected the media’s focus on public health issues. Conclusions: Text mining methods may address the limitations of traditional qualitative approaches. Using big data to understand public health needs is a novel approach that could help clinical and translational science awards programs focus on community-engaged research efforts to address community priorities. © The Association for Clinical and Translational Science 2019.",2021,,Journal of Clinical and Translational Science,5,1,,,10.1017/cts.2019.434,,#2296,Zolnoori 2021,"",""
"Understanding perceived site qualities and experiences of urban public spaces: A case study of social media reviews in Bryant Park, New York city","Song, Y.; Fernandez, J.; Wang, T.","Urban public spaces are a key component to the well-being and prosperity of modern society. It has been increasingly important to improve the qualities and maximize the usages of urban public spaces. There is a lack of studies that investigate how people use and perceive urban parks using quantitative analysis of location-based social media reviews. This study tackles this gap by introducing a case study that uses social media reviews (Tripadivisor.com) to understand the perceived site quality and experiences of Bryant Park in New York City. A large dataset including 11,419 Tripadvisor reviews from 10,615 users was collected. LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation), a natural language processing and machine learning technique, was used to perform topic modeling analysis that could reveal hidden themes in large amounts of text. The results include five semantic topics and their associated topic terms. A comprehensive overview of the user experiences in Bryant Park were provided along with their weekly and monthly dynamics. The findings provide insights for future public space designers and managers by revealing how users describe the designs and operations of Bryant Park. © 2020 by the authors.

Mechanism of Chaihu Shugan Powder (柴胡疏肝散) for Treating Depression Based on Network Pharmacology,"Liu, Y.-Y.; Hu, D.; Fan, Q.-Q.; Zhang, X.-H.; Zhu, Y.-C.; Ni, M.-Y.; Wang, Y.-M.; Zhang, L.-K.; Sheng, L.","Objective: To analyze the effective components of Chinese medicine (CM) contained in Chaihu Shugan Powder (柴胡疏肝散, CSP) in the treatment of depressive disorders and to predict its anti-depressant mechanism by network pharmacology. Methods: Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity calculation method was used to screen the active components of CSP. Traditional Chinese Medicine System Pharmacological Database Analysis Platform and text mining tool (GoPuMed database) were used to predict and screen the active ingredients of CSP and anti-depressive targets. Through Genetic Association Database, Therapeutic Target Database, and PharmGkb database targets for depression were obtained. Cytoscape3.2.1 software was used to establish a network map of the active ingredients-targets of CSP, and to analyze gene function and metabolic pathways through Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery and the Omicshare database. Results: The 121 active ingredients and 15 depression-related targets which were screened from the database can exert antidepressant effects by improving the neural plasticity, growth, transfer condition and gene expression of neuronal cell, and the raise of the expression of gap junction protein. The 15 targets passed 14 metabolic pathways, mainly involved in the regulation of neurotransmitters (5-hydroxytryptamine, dopamine and epinephrine), inflammatory mediator regulation of TRP channels, calcium signaling pathway, cyclic adenosine monophosphate signaling pathway and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and other signal channels to exert anti-depressant effects. Conclusion: This article reveals the possible mechanism of CSP in the treatment of depression through network pharmacology research, and lays a foundation for further target studies. © 2019, The Chinese Journal of Integrated Traditional and Western Medicine Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2020,,Chinese Journal of Integrative Medicine,26,12,921-928,,10.1007/s11655-019-3172-x,,#2303,Liu 2020,"",""
Discovering new social determinants of health concepts from unstructured data: Framework and evaluation,"Bettencourt-Silva, J.H.; Mulligan, N.; Sbodio, M.; Segrave-Daly, J.; Williams, R.; Lopez, V.; Alzate, C.","Social determinants of health (SDoH) are the complex set of circumstances in which individuals are born, or with which they live, that impact their health. Integrating SDoH into practice requires that information systems are able to identify SDoH-related concepts from charts and case notes through vocabularies or terminologies. Despite significant standardisation efforts across healthcare domains, SDoH coverage remains sparse in existing terminologies due to the broad spectrum of this domain, ranging from family relations, risk factors, to social programs and benefits, which are not consistently captured across administrative and clinical settings. This paper presents a framework to mine, evaluate and recommend new multidisciplinary concepts that relate to or impact the health and well-being of individuals using a word embedding model trained from a large dynamic corpus of unstructured data. Five key SDoH domains were selected and evaluated by domain experts. The concepts resulting from the trained model were matched against well-established meta-thesaurus UMLS and terminology SNOMED-CT and, overall, a significant proportion of concepts from a set of 10,000 candidates were not found (31% and 28% respectively). The results confirm both the gaps in current terminologies and the feasibility and impact of the methods presented in this paper for the incremental discovery and validation of new SDoH concepts together with domain experts. This sustainable approach facilitates the development and refinement of new and existing terminologies and, in turn, it allows systems such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) annotators to leverage SDoH concepts across integrated care settings. © 2020 European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI) and IOS Press.",2020,,Studies in Health Technology and Informatics,270,,173-177,,10.3233/SHTI200145,,#2305,Bettencourt-Silva 2020,"",""
Dreaming during the Covid-19 pandemic: Computational assessment of dream reports reveals mental suffering related to fear of contagion,"Mota, N.B.; Weissheimer, J.; Ribeiro, M.; de Paiva, M.; Avilla-Souza, J.; Simabucuru, G.; Chaves, M.F.; Cecchi, L.; Cirne, J.; Cecchi, G.; Rodrigues, C.; Copelli, M.; Ribeiro, S.","The current global threat brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic has led to widespread social isolation, posing new challenges in dealing with metal suffering related to social distancing, and in quickly learning new social habits intended to prevent contagion. Neuroscience and psychology agree that dreaming helps people to cope with negative emotions and to learn from experience, but can dreaming effectively reveal mental suffering and changes in social behavior? To address this question, we applied natural language processing tools to study 239 dream reports by 67 individuals, made either before the Covid-19 outbreak or during the months of March and April, 2020, when lockdown was imposed in Brazil following the WHO’s declaration of the pandemic. Pandemic dreams showed a higher proportion of anger and sadness words, and higher average semantic similarities to the terms “contamination” and “cleanness”. These features seem to be associated with mental suffering linked to social isolation, as they explained 40% of the variance in the PANSS negative subscale related to socialization (p = 0.0088). These results corroborate the hypothesis that pandemic dreams reflect mental suffering, fear of contagion, and important changes in daily habits that directly impact socialization. © 2020 Mota et al.

Prevalence of mental illnesses in domestic violence police records: Text mining study,"Karystianis, G.; Simpson, A.; Adily, A.; Schofield, P.; Greenberg, D.; Wand, H.; Nenadic, G.; Butler, T.","Background: The New South Wales Police Force (NSWPF) records details of significant numbers of domestic violence (DV) events they attend each year as both structured quantitative data and unstructured free text. Accessing information contained in the free text such as the victim’s and persons of interest (POI's) mental health status could be useful in the better management of DV events attended by the police and thus improve health, justice, and social outcomes. Objective: The aim of this study is to present the prevalence of extracted mental illness mentions for POIs and victims in police-recorded DV events. Methods: We applied a knowledge-driven text mining method to recognize mental illness mentions for victims and POIs from police-recorded DV events. Results: In 416,441 police-recorded DV events with single POIs and single victims, we identified 64,587 events (15.51%) with at least one mental illness mention versus 4295 (1.03%) recorded in the structured fixed fields. Two-thirds (67,582/85,880, 78.69%) of mental illnesses were associated with POIs versus 21.30% (18,298/85,880) with victims; depression was the most common condition in both victims (2822/12,589, 22.42%) and POIs (7496/39,269, 19.01%). Mental illnesses were most common among POIs aged 0-14 years (623/1612, 38.65%) and in victims aged over 65 years (1227/22,873, 5.36%). Conclusions: A wealth of mental illness information exists within police-recorded DV events that can be extracted using text mining. The results showed mood-related illnesses were the most common in both victims and POIs.

Maximizing the use of social and behavioural information from secondary care mental health electronic health records,"Goodday, S.M.; Kormilitzin, A.; Vaci, N.; Liu, Q.; Cipriani, A.; Smith, T.; Nevado-Holgado, A.","Purpose: The contribution of social and behavioural factors in the development of mental health conditions and treatment effectiveness is widely supported, yet there are weak population level data sources on social and behavioural determinants of mental health. Enriching these data gaps will be crucial to accelerating precision medicine. Some have suggested the broader use of electronic health records (EHR) as a source of non-clinical determinants, although social and behavioural information are not systematically collected metrics in EHRs, internationally. Objective: In this commentary, we highlight the nature and quality of key available structured and unstructured social and behavioural data using a case example of value counts from secondary mental health data available in the UK from the UK Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) database; highlight the methodological challenges in the use of such data; and possible solutions and opportunities involving the use of natural language processing (NLP) of unstructured EHR text. Conclusions: Most structured non-clinical data fields within secondary care mental health EHR data have too much missing data for adequate use. The utility of other non-clinical fields reported semi-consistently (e.g., ethnicity and marital status) is entirely dependent on treating them appropriately in analyses, quantifying the many reasons behind missingness in consideration of selection biases. Advancements in NLP offer new opportunities in the exploitation of unstructured text from secondary care EHR data particularly given that clinical notes and attachments are available in large volumes of patients and are more routinely completed by clinicians. Tackling ways to re-use, harmonize, and improve our existing and future secondary care mental health data, leveraging advanced analytics such as NLP is worth the effort in an attempt to fill the data gap on social and behavioural contributors to mental health conditions and will be necessary to fulfill all of the domains needed to inform personalized interventions. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2020,,Journal of Biomedical Informatics,107,,,,10.1016/j.jbi.2020.103429,,#2312,Goodday 2020,"",""
When public health research meets social media: Knowledge mapping from 2000 to 2018,"Zhang, Y.; Cao, B.; Wang, Y.; Peng, T.-Q.; Wang, X.","Background: Social media has substantially changed how people confront health issues. However, a comprehensive understanding of how social media has altered the foci and methods in public health research remains lacking. Objective: This study aims to examine research themes, the role of social media, and research methods in social media-based public health research published from 2000 to 2018. Methods: A dataset of 3419 valid studies was developed by searching a list of relevant keywords in the Web of Science and PubMed databases. In addition, this study employs an unsupervised text-mining technique and topic modeling to extract research themes of the published studies. Moreover, the role of social media and research methods adopted in those studies were analyzed. Results: This study identifies 25 research themes, covering different diseases, various population groups, physical and mental health, and other significant issues. Social media assumes two major roles in public health research: Produce substantial research interest for public health research and furnish a research context for public health research. Social media provides substantial research interest for public health research when used for health intervention, human-computer interaction, as a platform of social influence, and for disease surveillance, risk assessment, or prevention. Social media acts as a research context for public health research when it is mere reference, used as a platform to recruit participants, and as a platform for data collection. While both qualitative and quantitative methods are frequently used in this emerging area, cutting edge computational methods play a marginal role. Conclusions: Social media enables scholars to study new phenomena and propose new research questions in public health research. Meanwhile, the methodological potential of social media in public health research needs to be further explored. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

We Propose a text mining approach to detect adverse events and medication episodes from the clinical text to enhance our understanding of adverse effects related to Clozapine, the most effective antipsychotic drug for the management of treatment-resistant schizophrenia, but underutilised due to concerns over its side effects. Material and methods We used data from de-identified EHRs of three mental health trusts in the UK (>50 million documents, over 500,000 patients, 2835 of which were prescribed Clozapine). We explored the prevalence of 33 adverse effects by age, gender, ethnicity, smoking status and admission type three months before and after the patients started Clozapine treatment. Where possible, we compared the prevalence of adverse effects with those reported in the Side Effects Resource (SIDER). Results Sedation, fatigue, agitation, dizziness, hypersalivation, weight gain, tachycardia, headache, constipation and confusion were amongst the highest recorded Clozapine adverse effect in the three months following the start of treatment. Higher percentages of all adverse effects were found in the first month of Clozapine therapy. Using a significance level of (p< 0.05) our chi-square tests show a significant association between most of the ADRs and smoking status and hospital admission, and some in gender, ethnicity and age groups in all trusts hospitals. Later we combined the data from the three trusts hospitals to estimate the average effect of ADRs in each monthly interval. In gender and ethnicity, the results show significant association in 7 out of 33 ADRs, smoking status shows significant association in 21 out of 33 ADRs and hospital admission shows the significant association in 30 out of 33 ADRs.

Identification and characterization of tweets related to the 2015 Indiana HIV outbreak: A retrospective infoveillance study,"Cai, M.; Shah, N.; Li, J.; Chen, W.-H.; Cuomo, R.E.; Obradovich, N.; Mackey, T.K.","Introduction From late 2014 through 2015, Scott County, Indiana faced an HIV outbreak triggered by opioid abuse and transition to injection drug use. Investigating the origins, risk factors, and responses related to this outbreak is critical to inform future surveillance, interventions, and policymaking. In response, this retrospective infoveillance study identifies and characterizes user-generated messages related to opioid abuse, heroin injection drug use, and HIV status using natural language processing (NLP) among Twitter users in Indiana during the period of this HIV outbreak. Materials and methods Our study consisted of two phases: data collection and processing, and data analysis. We collected Indiana geolocated tweets from the public Twitter API using Amazon Web Services EC2 instances filtered for geocoded messages in the immediate pre and post period of the outbreak. In the data analysis phase we applied an unsupervised machine learning approach using NLP called the Biterm Topic Model (BTM) to identify tweets related to opioid, heroin/injection, and HIV behavior and then examined these messages for HIV risk-related topics that could be associated with the outbreak. Results More than 10 million geocoded tweets occurring in Indiana during the immediate pre and post period of the outbreak were collected for analysis. Using BTM, we identified 1350 tweets thought to be relevant to the outbreak and then confirmed 358 tweets using human annotation. The most prevalent themes identified were tweets related to self-reported abuse of illicit and prescription drugs, opioid use disorder, self-reported HIV status, and public sentiment regarding the outbreak. Geospatial analysis found that these messages clustered in population dense areas outside of the outbreak, including Indianapolis and neighboring Clark County. Discussion This infoveillance study characterized the social media conversations of communities in Indiana in the pre and post period of the 2015 HIV outbreak. Behavioral themes detected reflect discussion about risk factors related to HIV transmission stemming from opioid and heroin abuse for priority populations, and also help identify community attitudes that could have motivated or detracted the use of HIV prevention methods, along with helping identify factors that can impede access to prevention services. Conclusions Infoveillance approaches, such as the analysis conducted in this study, represent a possibly strategy to detect “signal” of the emergence of risk factors associated with an outbreak though may be limited in their scope and generalizability. Our results, in conjunction with other forms of public health surveillance, can leverage the growing ubiquity of social media platforms to better detect opioid-related HIV risk knowledge, attitudes and behavior, as well as inform future prevention efforts.

Coronaviruses and people with intellectual disability: an exploratory data analysis,"Tummers, J.; Catal, C.; Tobi, H.; Tekinerdogan, B.; Leusink, G.","Background: Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been announced as a new coronavirus disease by the World Health Organization. At the time of writing this article (April 2020), the world is drastically influenced by the COVID-19. Recently, the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) was published. For researchers on ID such as ourselves, it is of key interest to learn whether this open research dataset may be used to investigate the virus and its consequences for people with an ID. Methods: From CORD-19, we identified full-text articles containing terms related to the ID care and applied a text mining technique, specifically the term frequency–inverse document frequency analysis in combination with K-means clustering. Results: Two hundred fifty-nine articles contained one or more of our specified terms related to ID. We were able to cluster these articles related to ID into five clusters on different topics, namely: mental health, viral diseases, diagnoses and treatments, maternal care and paediatrics, and genetics. Conclusion: The CORD-19 open research dataset consists of valuable information about not only COVID-19 disease but also ID and the relationship between them. We suggest researchers investigate literature-based discovery approaches on the CORD-19 and develop a new dataset that addresses the intersection of these two fields for further research. © 2020 The Authors.

A feasibility study using a machine learning suicide risk prediction model based on open-ended interview language in adolescent therapy sessions,"Cohen, J.; Wright-Berryman, J.; Rohlfs, L.; Wright, D.; Campbell, M.; Gingrich, D.; Santel, D.; Pestian, J.","Background: As adolescent suicide rates continue to rise, innovation in risk identification is warranted. Machine learning can identify suicidal individuals based on their language samples. This feasibility pilot was conducted to explore this technology’s use in adolescent therapy sessions and assess machine learning model performance. Method: Natural language processing machine learning models to identify level of suicide risk using a smartphone app were tested in outpatient therapy sessions. Data collection included language samples, depression and suicidality standardized scale scores, and therapist impression of the client’s mental state. Previously developed models were used to predict suicidal risk. Results: 267 interviews were collected from 60 students in eight schools by ten therapists, with 29 students indicating suicide or self-harm risk. During external validation, models were trained on suicidal speech samples collected from two separate studies. We found that support vector machines (AUC: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.69–0.81) and logistic regression (AUC: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.70–0.82) lead to good discriminative ability, with an extreme gradient boosting model performing the best (AUC: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.72–0.84).

Utilizing deep learning and graph mining to identify drug use on Twitter data,"Tassone, J.; Yan, P.; Simpson, M.; Mendhe, C.; Mago, V.; Choudhury, S.","Background: The collection and examination of social media has become a useful mechanism for studying the mental activity and behavior tendencies of users. Through the analysis of a collected set of Twitter data, a model will be developed for predicting positively referenced, drug-related tweets. From this, trends and correlations can be determined. Methods: Social media data (tweets and attributes) were collected and processed using topic pertaining keywords, such as drug slang and use-conditions (methods of drug consumption). Potential candidates were preprocessed resulting in a dataset of 3,696,150 rows. The predictive classification power of multiple methods was compared including SVM, XGBoost, BERT and CNN-based classifiers. For the latter, a deep learning approach was implemented to screen and analyze the semantic meaning of the tweets. Results: To test the predictive capability of the model, SVM and XGBoost were first employed. The results calculated from the models respectively displayed an accuracy of 59.33% and 54.90%, with AUC’s of 0.87 and 0.71. The values show a low predictive capability with little discrimination. Conversely, the CNN-based classifiers presented a significant improvement, between the two models tested. The first was trained with 2661 manually labeled samples, while the other included synthetically generated tweets culminating in 12,142 samples. The accuracy scores were 76.35% and 82.31%, with an AUC of 0.90 and 0.91. Using association rule mining in conjunction with the CNN-based classifier showed a high likelihood for keywords such as “smoke”, “cocaine”, and “marijuana” triggering a drug-positive classification. Conclusion: Predictive analysis with a CNN is promising, whereas attribute-based models presented little predictive capability and were not suitable for analyzing text of data. This research found that the commonly mentioned drugs had a level of correspondence with frequently used illicit substances, proving the practical usefulness of this system. Lastly, the synthetically generated set provided increased accuracy scores and improves the predictive capability. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020,,BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making,20,,,,10.1186/s12911-020-01335-3,,#2345,Tassone 2020,"",""
Natural language processing reveals vulnerable mental health support groups and heightened health anxiety on reddit during COVID-19: Observational study,"Low, D.M.; Rumker, L.; Talkar, T.; Torous, J.; Cecchi, G.; Ghosh, S.S.","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting mental health, but it is not clear how people with different types of mental health problems were differentially impacted as the initial wave of cases hit. Objective: The aim of this study is to leverage natural language processing (NLP) with the goal of characterizing changes in 15 of the world’s largest mental health support groups (eg, r/schizophrenia, r/SuicideWatch, r/Depression) found on the website Reddit, along with 11 non–mental health groups (eg, r/PersonalFinance, r/conspiracy) during the initial stage of the pandemic. Methods: We created and released the Reddit Mental Health Dataset including posts from 826,961 unique users from 2018 to 2020. Using regression, we analyzed trends from 90 text-derived features such as sentiment analysis, personal pronouns, and semantic categories. Using supervised machine learning, we classified posts into their respective support groups and interpreted important features to understand how different problems manifest in language. We applied unsupervised methods such as topic modeling and unsupervised clustering to uncover concerns throughout Reddit before and during the pandemic. Results: We found that the r/HealthAnxiety forum showed spikes in posts about COVID-19 early on in January, approximately 2 months before other support groups started posting about the pandemic. There were many features that significantly increased during COVID-19 for specific groups including the categories “economic stress,” “isolation,” and “home,” while others such as “motion” significantly decreased. We found that support groups related to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, eating disorders, and anxiety showed the most negative semantic change during the pandemic out of all mental health groups. Health anxiety emerged as a general theme across Reddit through independent supervised and unsupervised machine learning analyses. For instance, we provide evidence that the concerns of a diverse set of individuals are converging in this unique moment of history; we discovered that the more users posted about COVID-19, the more linguistically similar (less distant) the mental health support groups became to r/HealthAnxiety (ρ=–0.96, P<.001). Using unsupervised clustering, we found the suicidality and loneliness clusters more than doubled in the number of posts during the pandemic. Specifically, the support groups for borderline personality disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder became significantly associated with the suicidality cluster. Furthermore, clusters surrounding self-harm and entertainment emerged. Conclusions: By using a broad set of NLP techniques and analyzing a baseline of prepandemic posts, we uncovered patterns of how specific mental health problems manifest in language, identified at-risk users, and revealed the distribution of concerns across Reddit, which could help provide better resources to its millions of users. We then demonstrated that textual analysis is sensitive to uncover mental health complaints as they appear in real time, identifying vulnerable groups and alarming themes during COVID-19, and thus may have utility during the ongoing pandemic and other world-changing events such as elections and protests. ©Daniel M Low, Laurie Rumker, Tanya Talkar, John Torous, Guillermo Cecchi, Satrajit S Ghosh.",2020,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,22,10,,,10.2196/22635,,#2346,Low 2020,"",""
Characterizing DSM-5 and ICD-11 personality disorder features in psychiatric inpatients at scale using electronic health records,"Barroilhet, S.A.; Pellegrini, A.M.; McCoy, T.H.; Perlis, R.H.","Background Investigation of personality traits and pathology in large, generalizable clinical cohorts has been hindered by inconsistent assessment and failure to consider a range of personality disorders (PDs) simultaneously. Methods We applied natural language processing (NLP) of electronic health record notes to characterize a psychiatric inpatient cohort. A set of terms reflecting personality trait domains were derived, expanded, and then refined based on expert consensus. Latent Dirichlet allocation was used to score notes to estimate the extent to which any given note reflected PD topics. Regression models were used to examine the relationship of these estimates with sociodemographic features and length of stay. Results Among 3623 patients with 4702 admissions, being male, non-white, having a low burden of medical comorbidity, being admitted through the emergency department, and having public insurance were independently associated with greater levels of disinhibition, detachment, and psychoticism. Being female, white, and having private insurance were independently associated with greater levels of negative affectivity. The presence of disinhibition, psychoticism, and negative affectivity were each significantly associated with a longer stay, while detachment was associated with a shorter stay. Conclusions Personality features can be systematically and scalably measured using NLP in the inpatient setting, and some of these features associate with length of stay. Developing treatment strategies for patients scoring high in certain personality dimensions may facilitate more efficient, targeted interventions, and may help reduce the impact of personality features on mental health service utilization.  © 2019 Cambridge University Press.",2020,,Psychological Medicine,50,13,2221-2229,,10.1017/S0033291719002320,,#2348,Barroilhet 2020,"",""
Using a digital patient powered research network to identify outcomes of importance to patients with multiple myeloma,"Gries, K.S.; Fastenau, J.","Background: Social media platforms give patients a voice by allowing them to discuss their health and connect with others. These unfiltered and genuine reports offer direct access to what matters most to patients. Exploring the patient-reported outcomes discussed in these platforms reveal clinical insights and behavioral patterns of the real-world patient journey. This research study reviewed health-related quality of life (HRQoL) concepts reported by patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Methods: Data were obtained using the Belong.life patient-powered research network (PPRN) using social media listening methods. The analysis cohort consisted of adults diagnosed with MM who signed into the Belong.life platform by June 2018. Natural language processing and medical neural networks were utilized to extract text data to mine and scan for concepts using programmed algorithms. The textual review of the data was conducted on two levels: the over-arching concept of interest (broad symptom and impact classification) and the more specific symptom and impacts report. Concepts were analyzed descriptively and summarized by age, gender, context of report, and stage of disease/treatment journey. Results: Two hundred thirty patients with MM from the United States (52%), Israel (42%), Canada (3%), and 3% from Egypt, France, Greece, India, United Kingdom, and Australia were identified. A total of 57% were female and at account registration the median age was 57 years. A total of 126 patients had evaluable text data to search concepts being discussed. The PPRN platform identified 93% of the concepts from the conceptual model developed based on prior literature review. The most commonly reported symptoms were neuropathy, tiredness, nausea, back pain, fatigue, and bone pain. Back pain appeared as the most prominent symptom early in the disease and sometimes occurred prior to MM diagnosis. Tiredness, nausea, fatigue, and bone pain were frequently reported after MM diagnosis, with the start of treatment. Conclusion: Patient-oriented social media platforms, such as Belong.life, can capture and contribute to a holistic vision of concepts surrounding patients’ HRQoL. The ability to understand when a certain debilitating symptom appeared and to which sub-population of patients may allow for a personalized approach to treatment, improving adherence and quality of care as well as increasing patient well-being. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020,,Journal of Patient-Reported Outcomes,4,1,,,10.1186/s41687-020-00242-5,,#2350,Gries 2020,"",""
Youtube video comments on healthy eating: Descriptive and predictive analysis,"Teng, S.; Khong, K.W.; Sharif, S.P.; Ahmed, A.","Background: Poor nutrition and food selection lead to health issues such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. This study of YouTube comments aims to uncover patterns of food choices and the factors driving them, in addition to exploring the sentiments of healthy eating in networked communities. Objective: The objectives of the study are to explore the determinants, motives, and barriers to healthy eating behaviors in online communities and provide insight into YouTube video commenters’ perceptions and sentiments of healthy eating through text mining techniques. Methods: This paper applied text mining techniques to identify and categorize meaningful healthy eating determinants. These determinants were then incorporated into hypothetically defined constructs that reflect their thematic and sentimental nature in order to test our proposed model using a variance-based structural equation modeling procedure. Results: With a dataset of 4654 comments extracted from YouTube videos in the context of Malaysia, we apply a text mining method to analyze the perceptions and behavior of healthy eating. There were 10 clusters identified with regard to food ingredients, food price, food choice, food portion, well-being, cooking, and culture in the concept of healthy eating. The structural equation modeling results show that clusters are positively associated with healthy eating with all P values less than .001, indicating a statistical significance of the study results. People hold complex and multifaceted beliefs about healthy eating in the context of YouTube videos. Fruits and vegetables are the epitome of healthy foods. Despite having a favorable perception of healthy eating, people may not purchase commonly recognized healthy food if it has a premium price. People associate healthy eating with weight concerns. Food taste, variety, and availability are identified as reasons why Malaysians cannot act on eating healthily. Conclusions: This study offers significant value to the existing literature of health-related studies by investigating the rich and diverse social media data gleaned from YouTube. This research integrated text mining analytics with predictive modeling techniques to identify thematic constructs and analyze the sentiments of healthy eating. ©Shasha Teng, Kok Wei Khong, Saeed Pahlevan Sharif, Amr Ahmed.",2020,,JMIR Public Health and Surveillance,6,4,,,10.2196/19618,,#2353,Teng 2020,"",""
Evaluation of Suicide Mortality among Sexual Minority US Veterans from 2000 to 2017,"Lynch, K.E.; Gatsby, E.; Viernes, B.; Schliep, K.C.; Whitcomb, B.W.; Alba, P.R.; Duvall, S.L.; Blosnich, J.R.","Importance: Identification of subgroups at greatest risk for suicide mortality is essential for prevention efforts and targeting interventions. Sexual minority individuals may have an increased risk for suicide compared with heterosexual individuals, but a lack of sufficiently powered studies with rigorous methods for determining sexual orientation has limited the knowledge on this potential health disparity. Objective: To investigate suicide mortality among sexual minority veterans using Veterans Health Administration (VHA) electronic health record data. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective population-based cohort study used data on 8.1 million US veterans enrolled in the VHA after fiscal year 1999 that were obtained from VHA electronic health records from October 1, 1999 to September 30, 2017. Data analysis was carried out from March 1, 2020 to October 31, 2020. Exposure: Veterans with documentation of a minority sexual orientation. Documentation of sexual minority status was obtained through natural language processing of clinical notes and extraction of structured administrative data for sexual orientation in VHA electronic health records. Main Outcomes and Measures: Suicide mortality rate using data on the underlying cause of death obtained from the National Death Index. Crude and age-adjusted mortality rates were calculated for all-cause death and death from suicide among sexual minority veterans compared with the general US population and the general population of veterans. Results: Among the 96893 veterans with at least 1 sexual minority documentation in the electronic health record, the mean (SD) age was 46 (16) years, 68% were male, and 70% were White. Of the 12591 total deaths, 3.5% were from suicide. Veterans had a significantly higher rate of mortality from suicide (standardized mortality ratio, 4.50; 95% CI, 4.13-4.99) compared with the general US population. Suicide was the fifth leading cause of death in 2017 among sexual minority veterans (3.8% of deaths) and the tenth leading cause of death in the general US population (1.7% of deaths). The crude suicide rate among sexual minority veterans (82.5 per 100000 person-years) was higher than the rate in the general veteran population (37.7 per 100000 person-years). Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this population-based cohort study suggest that sexual minority veterans have a greater risk for suicide than the general US population and the general veteran population. Further research is needed to determine whether and how suicide prevention efforts reach sexual minority veterans.. © 2021 Royal Society of Chemistry.

Robust effect of justice for others: Evidence from word embedding association test,"Wu, S.; Yang, C.; Wang, S.; Ma, R.; Han, B.","Maintenance of control and non-randomness is the fundamental need of human beings, and people are motivated to see social and physical environments as stable and orderly, so that the belief about the controlled and nonrandom world is protected. According to just motive theory, people tend to believe in a just world, in which good deeds get rewarded and bad evils get punished, and this belief helps individuals get the sense of control. Otherwise, it is difficult for individuals to pursuit long-term goals and obey social rules in ordinary lives. Recent evidence shows that there are self-others' distinctions regarding belief in a just world (BJW). In particular, BJW for others is found to be processed more primitively and influenced more possibly by cultural norms, whereas BJW for the self is processed more elaborately and influenced more possibly by personal experiences. And BJW for others is more related to the indicators of human values and social attitudes, such as world assumption and justice restoration, whereas BJW for the self is more related to the indicators of personal wellness, such as self-esteem and mental health. More important, justice motive is an implicit process, and in particular justice motive for others (vs. for the self) plays a critical role in shaping human values and social attitudes, which is often hidden in the explicit measurement because of social desirability and sample bias. However, it is difficult for researchers to measure the implicit process of justice motive, especially for others' lives and the whole society. Many studies, especially those conducted among college students and middle class populations, yielded that BJW for others was endorsed lower than BJW for the self. Therefore, more and more researchers recommend that BJW(s) should be measured through implicit tests and large-scale samples. Based on machine learning and Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT), the present research was to test the robust effect of justice for others in terms of the word or sentence vector similarity, with a greater similarity indicating a higher level of semantic association. First, in the word vector model of the Sina Weibo corpus, the word vector similarity of ""others"" and ""justice"" was significantly greater than that of ""self"" and ""justice"", and this pattern was replicated through the word vector model of a comprehensive Weibo corpus. Further, we calculated the sentence vector through the Google BERT model, and found that the sentence vector similarity of ""others"" and ""justice"" was also significantly greater than that of ""self"" and ""justice"". In conclusion, both results via word vector and sentence vector demonstrate the robust effect of others regarding implicit just-world beliefs, in that as compared with one's own experiences, people are more likely to believe that others' world or the whole society is a just place. Furthermore, this study also suggests that internet users' fundamental need for social order is automatically embedded in the cyberspace which is seemingly random and disordered, and the WEAT provides a new method to measure human's social attitude behind the unstructured texts. © 2020, Science Press.

Depression risk prediction for chinese microblogs via deep-learning methods: Content analysis,"Wang, X.; Chen, S.; Li, T.; Li, W.; Zhou, Y.; Zheng, J.; Chen, Q.; Yan, J.; Tang, B.","Background: Depression is a serious personal and public mental health problem. Self-reporting is the main method used to diagnose depression and to determine the severity of depression. However, it is not easy to discover patients with depression owing to feelings of shame in disclosing or discussing their mental health conditions with others. Moreover, self-reporting is time-consuming, and usually leads to missing a certain number of cases. Therefore, automatic discovery of patients with depression from other sources such as social media has been attracting increasing attention. Social media, as one of the most important daily communication systems, connects large quantities of people, including individuals with depression, and provides a channel to discover patients with depression. In this study, we investigated deep-learning methods for depression risk prediction using data from Chinese microblogs, which have potential to discover more patients with depression and to trace their mental health conditions. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the potential of state-of-the-art deep-learning methods on depression risk prediction from Chinese microblogs. Methods: Deep-learning methods with pretrained language representation models, including bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), robustly optimized BERT pretraining approach (RoBERTa), and generalized autoregressive pretraining for language understanding (XLNET), were investigated for depression risk prediction, and were compared with previous methods on a manually annotated benchmark dataset. Depression risk was assessed at four levels from 0 to 3, where 0, 1, 2, and 3 denote no inclination, and mild, moderate, and severe depression risk, respectively. The dataset was collected from the Chinese microblog Weibo. We also compared different deep-learning methods with pretrained language representation models in two settings: (1) publicly released pretrained language representation models, and (2) language representation models further pretrained on a large-scale unlabeled dataset collected from Weibo. Precision, recall, and F1 scores were used as performance evaluation measures. Results: Among the three deep-learning methods, BERT achieved the best performance with a microaveraged F1 score of 0.856. RoBERTa achieved the best performance with a macroaveraged F1 score of 0.424 on depression risk at levels 1, 2, and 3, which represents a new benchmark result on the dataset. The further pretrained language representation models demonstrated improvement over publicly released prediction models. Conclusions: We applied deep-learning methods with pretrained language representation models to automatically predict depression risk using data from Chinese microblogs. The experimental results showed that the deep-learning methods performed better than previous methods, and have greater potential to discover patients with depression and to trace their mental health conditions. © 2020 Xiaofeng Wang, Shuai Chen, Tao Li, Wanting Li, Yejie Zhou, Jie Zheng, Qingcai Chen, Jun Yan, Buzhou Tang.",2020,,JMIR Medical Informatics,8,7,,,10.2196/17958,,#2361,Wang 2020,"",""
Analysis on Reflective Writing Using Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis,"Chong, C.; Sheikh, U.U.; Samah, N.A.; Sha'Ameri, A.Z.","Natural Language Processing (NLP) opens up the possibility for a machine to help us human process the vast data out there. There are multiple branches of NLP, but this thesis focuses on sentiment analysis, more specifically for reflective writing analysis. However, to obtain accurate results, NLP model needs to be tailored for the specific application. In this thesis, an NLP model is developed to process survey results obtained from psychology course by building a word database and categorise the level of reflection using fuzzy logic system. The main processes involved in this work are mainly performing intensive literature review on reflective writing models and to design fuzzy logic rules which can categorise the various levels of reflection demonstrated by the students. The model is then used to analyse a total of 47 reflective journals collected from the survey responses of the students from the School of Education in UTM. These surveys need to be pre-processed using some tools such as Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK) to be fed to the developed model. There is the need to build a word database with words specific to the psychology field to improve the accuracy. From the analysis of the students' survey, most of the students exhibit level 1-2 reflection. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",2020,,IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering,884,1,,,10.1088/1757-899X/884/1/012069,,#2362,Chong 2020,"",""
Violence detection explanation via semantic roles embeddings,"Mensa, E.; Colla, D.; Dalmasso, M.; Giustini, M.; Mamo, C.; Pitidis, A.; Radicioni, D.P.","Background: Emergency room reports pose specific challenges to natural language processing techniques. In this setting, violence episodes on women, elderly and children are often under-reported. Categorizing textual descriptions as containing violence-related injuries (V) vs. non-violence-related injuries (NV) is thus a relevant task to the ends of devising alerting mechanisms to track (and prevent) violence episodes. Methods: We present ViDeS (so dubbed after Violence Detection System), a system to detect episodes of violence from narrative texts in emergency room reports. It employs a deep neural network for categorizing textual ER reports data, and complements such output by making explicit which elements corroborate the interpretation of the record as reporting about violence-related injuries. To these ends we designed a novel hybrid technique for filling semantic frames that employs distributed representations of terms herein, along with syntactic and semantic information. The system has been validated on real data annotated with two sorts of information: about the presence vs. absence of violence-related injuries, and about some semantic roles that can be interpreted as major cues for violent episodes, such as the agent that committed violence, the victim, the body district involved, etc. The employed dataset contains over 150K records annotated with class (V,NV) information, and 200 records with finer-grained information on the aforementioned semantic roles. Results: We used data coming from an Italian branch of the EU-Injury Database (EU-IDB) project, compiled by hospital staff. Categorization figures approach full precision and recall for negative cases and.97 precision and.94 recall on positive cases. As regards as the recognition of semantic roles, we recorded an accuracy varying from.28 to.90 according to the semantic roles involved. Moreover, the system allowed unveiling annotation errors committed by hospital staff. Conclusions: Explaining systems’ results, so to make their output more comprehensible and convincing, is today necessary for AI systems. Our proposal is to combine distributed and symbolic (frame-like) representations as a possible answer to such pressing request for interpretability. Although presently focused on the medical domain, the proposed methodology is general and, in principle, it can be extended to further application areas and categorization tasks. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020,,BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making,20,1,,,10.1186/s12911-020-01237-4,,#2364,Mensa 2020,"",""
Leveraging the power of nondisruptive technologies to optimize mental health treatment: Case study,"Sadeh-Sharvit, S.; Hollon, S.D.","Regular assessment of the effectiveness of behavioral interventions is a potent tool for improving their relevance to patients. However, poor provider and patient adherence characterize most measurement-based care tools. Therefore, a new approach for measuring intervention effects and communicating them to providers in a seamless manner is warranted. This paper provides a brief overview of the available research evidence on novel ways to measure the effects of behavioral treatments, integrating both objective and subjective data. We highlight the importance of analyzing therapeutic conversations through natural language processing. We then suggest a conceptual framework for capitalizing on data captured through directly collected and nondisruptive methodologies to describe the client's characteristics and needs and inform clinical decision-making. We then apply this context in exploring a new tool to integrate the content of therapeutic conversations and patients' self-reports. We present a case study of how both subjective and objective measures of treatment effects were implemented in cognitive-behavioral treatment for depression and anxiety and then utilized in treatment planning, delivery, and termination. In this tool, called Eleos, the patient completes standardized measures of depression and anxiety. The content of the treatment sessions was evaluated using nondisruptive, independent measures of conversation content, fidelity to the treatment model, and the back-and-forth of client-therapist dialogue. Innovative applications of advances in digital health are needed to disseminate empirically supported interventions and measure them in a noncumbersome way. Eleos appears to be a feasible, sustainable, and effective way to assess behavioral health care. © Shiri Sadeh-Sharvit, Steven D Hollon.

Social media text mining framework for drug abuse: Development and validation study with an opioid crisis case analysis,"Nasralah, T.; El-Gayar, O.; Wang, Y.","Background: Social media are considered promising and viable sources of data for gaining insights into various disease conditions and patients' attitudes, behaviors, and medications. They can be used to recognize communication and behavioral themes of problematic use of prescription drugs. However, mining and analyzing social media data have challenges and limitations related to topic deduction and data quality. As a result, we need a structured approach to analyze social media content related to drug abuse in a manner that can mitigate the challenges and limitations surrounding the use of such data. Objective: This study aimed to develop and evaluate a framework for mining and analyzing social media content related to drug abuse. The framework is designed to mitigate challenges and limitations related to topic deduction and data quality in social media data analytics for drug abuse. Methods: The proposed framework started with defining different terms related to the keywords, categories, and characteristics of the topic of interest. We then used the Crimson Hexagon platform to collect data based on a search query informed by a drug abuse ontology developed using the identified terms. We subsequently preprocessed the data and examined the quality using an evaluation matrix. Finally, a suitable data analysis approach could be used to analyze the collected data. Results: The framework was evaluated using the opioid epidemic as a drug abuse case analysis. We demonstrated the applicability of the proposed framework to identify public concerns toward the opioid epidemic and the most discussed topics on social media related to opioids. The results from the case analysis showed that the framework could improve the discovery and identification of topics in social media domains characterized by a plethora of highly diverse terms and lack of a commonly available dictionary or language by the community, such as in the case of opioid and drug abuse. Conclusions: The proposed framework addressed the challenges related to topic detection and data quality. We demonstrated the applicability of the proposed framework to identify the common concerns toward the opioid epidemic and the most discussed topics on social media related to opioids. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Generation and evaluation of artificial mental health records for Natural Language Processing,"Ive, J.; Viani, N.; Kam, J.; Yin, L.; Verma, S.; Puntis, S.; Cardinal, R.N.; Roberts, A.; Stewart, R.; Velupillai, S.","A serious obstacle to the development of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods in the clinical domain is the accessibility of textual data. The mental health domain is particularly challenging, partly because clinical documentation relies heavily on free text that is difficult to de-identify completely. This problem could be tackled by using artificial medical data. In this work, we present an approach to generate artificial clinical documents. We apply this approach to discharge summaries from a large mental healthcare provider and discharge summaries from an intensive care unit. We perform an extensive intrinsic evaluation where we (1) apply several measures of text preservation; (2) measure how much the model memorises training data; and (3) estimate clinical validity of the generated text based on a human evaluation task. Furthermore, we perform an extrinsic evaluation by studying the impact of using artificial text in a downstream NLP text classification task. We found that using this artificial data as training data can lead to classification results that are comparable to the original results. Additionally, using only a small amount of information from the original data to condition the generation of the artificial data is successful, which holds promise for reducing the risk of these artificial data retaining rare information from the original data. This is an important finding for our long-term goal of being able to generate artificial clinical data that can be released to the wider research community and accelerate advances in developing computational methods that use healthcare data. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020,,npj Digital Medicine,3,1,,,10.1038/s41746-020-0267-x,,#2370,Ive 2020,"",""
Social reminiscence in older adults' everyday conversations: Automated detection using natural language processing and machine learning,"Ferrario, A.; Demiray, B.; Yordanova, K.; Luo, M.; Martin, M.","Background: Reminiscence is the act of thinking or talking about personal experiences that occurred in the past. It is a central task of old age that is essential for healthy aging, and it serves multiple functions, such as decision-making and introspection, transmitting life lessons, and bonding with others. The study of social reminiscence behavior in everyday life can be used to generate data and detect reminiscence from general conversations. Objective: The aims of this original paper are to (1) preprocess coded transcripts of conversations in German of older adults with natural language processing (NLP), and (2) implement and evaluate learning strategies using different NLP features and machine learning algorithms to detect reminiscence in a corpus of transcripts. Methods: The methods in this study comprise (1) collecting and coding of transcripts of older adults' conversations in German, (2) preprocessing transcripts to generate NLP features (bag-of-words models, part-of-speech tags, pretrained German word embeddings), and (3) training machine learning models to detect reminiscence using random forests, support vector machines, and adaptive and extreme gradient boosting algorithms. The data set comprises 2214 transcripts, including 109 transcripts with reminiscence. Due to class imbalance in the data, we introduced three learning strategies: (1) class-weighted learning, (2) a meta-classifier consisting of a voting ensemble, and (3) data augmentation with the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) algorithm. For each learning strategy, we performed cross-validation on a random sample of the training data set of transcripts. We computed the area under the curve (AUC), the average precision (AP), precision, recall, as well as F1 score and specificity measures on the test data, for all combinations of NLP features, algorithms, and learning strategies. Results: Class-weighted support vector machines on bag-of-words features outperformed all other classifiers (AUC=0.91, AP=0.56, precision=0.5, recall=0.45, F1=0.48, specificity=0.98), followed by support vector machines on SMOTE-augmented data and word embeddings features (AUC=0.89, AP=0.54, precision=0.35, recall=0.59, F1=0.44, specificity=0.94). For the meta-classifier strategy, adaptive and extreme gradient boosting algorithms trained on word embeddings and bag-of-words outperformed all other classifiers and NLP features; however, the performance of the meta-classifier learning strategy was lower compared to other strategies, with highly imbalanced precision-recall trade-offs. Conclusions: This study provides evidence of the applicability of NLP and machine learning pipelines for the automated detection of reminiscence in older adults' everyday conversations in German. The methods and findings of this study could be relevant for designing unobtrusive computer systems for the real-time detection of social reminiscence in the everyday life of older adults and classifying their functions. With further improvements, these systems could be deployed in health interventions aimed at improving older adults' well-being by promoting self-reflection and suggesting coping strategies to be used in the case of dysfunctional reminiscence cases, which can undermine physical and mental health. © Andrea Ferrario, Burcu Demiray, Kristina Yordanova, Minxia Luo, Mike Martin.

Social Media Responses to Elective Surgery Cancellations in the Wake of COVID-19,"Rao, S.A.; Ravi, M.S.; Zhao, J.W.; Sturgeon, C.; Bilimoria, K.Y.","Objective:To assess public response to cancellations of elective surgeries following the American College of Surgeons' (ACS) recommendation on March 13.Methods:We queried text comments from Reddit, a social media platform and the fifth most popular website in the United States. Comments were manually reviewed to assess for relevance to elective surgery in the United States during the global coronavirus outbreak, whether the text was written by a healthcare worker (HCW), whether the user was based in the United States, and whether the text documented cancellations of surgery, expected cancellations of surgery, or surgery ongoing after the ACS announcement. Analysis of overall sentiment and negativity in comment text was performed using the Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning (VADER), a validated natural language processing tool previously used in studies of health behaviors using social media. Non-parametric tests were used for subgroup comparisons based on posting date and characteristics identified during manual review.Results:Following manual review, 1272 comments were included for analysis. Overall sentiment among non-HCWs became significantly more negative following the ACS announcement (P = 0.037). Overall sentiment did not significantly differ between HCWs and non-HCWs prior to the ACS announcement (P = 0.98), but non-HCW sentiment became significantly more negative than HCW sentiment after the announcement (P = 0.027). Negativity scores in posts describing cancellations were significantly higher among posts written by non-HCWs than HCWs (P = 0.028).Conclusions:Cancellation of elective surgeries had an adverse emotional impact on non-HCWs.

Glimpsing the Impact of COVID19 Lock-Down on People With Epilepsy: A Text Mining Approach,"Lanzone, J.; Cenci, C.; Tombini, M.; Ricci, L.; Tufo, T.; Piccioli, M.; Marrelli, A.; Mecarelli, O.; Assenza, G.","Objectives: To describe how the recent lock-down, related to SARS-COV-II outbreak in Italy, affected People With Epilepsy (PwE), we designed a survey focused on subjective reactions. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP), we analyzed words PwE and People without Epilepsy (PwoE) chose to express their reactions. Methods: As a subset of a larger survey, we collected from both PwE (427) and PwoE (452) single words (one per subject) associated to the period of lock down. The survey was spread thanks to the efforts of Italian league against epilepsy Foundation during the days of maximum raise of the pandemic. Data were analyzed via bag of word and sentiment analysis techniques in R. Results: PwoE and PwE showed significantly different distribution in word choice (X2, p = 4.904e−13). A subset of subject used positive words to describe this period, subjects with positive feelings about the lock down were more represented in the PwE group (X2, p = 0.045). Conclusion: PwoE developed reactive stress response to the restrictions enacted during lock-down. PwE, instead, chose words expressing sadness and concern with their disease. PwE appear to internalize more the trauma of lock down. Interestingly PwE also expressed positive feelings about this period of isolation more frequently than PwoE. Our study gives interesting insights on how People with Epilepsy react to traumatic events, using methods that evidence features that do not emerge with psychometric scales. © Copyright © 2020 Lanzone, Cenci, Tombini, Ricci, Tufo, Piccioli, Marrelli, Mecarelli and Assenza.",2020,,Frontiers in Neurology,11,,,,10.3389/fneur.2020.00870,,#2387,Lanzone 2020,"",""
Artificial Intelligence in mental health and the biases of language based models,"Straw, I.; Callison-Burch, C.","Background The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the healthcare field has occurred with little communication between computer scientists and doctors. The impact of AI on health outcomes and inequalities calls for health professionals and data scientists to make a collaborative effort to ensure historic health disparities are not encoded into the future. We present a study that evaluates bias in existing Natural Language Processing (NLP) models used in psychiatry and discuss how these biases may widen health inequalities. Our approach systematically evaluates each stage of model development to explore how biases arise from a clinical, data science and linguistic perspective. Design/Methods A literature review of the uses of NLP in mental health was carried out across multiple disciplinary databases with defined Mesh terms and keywords. Our primary analysis evaluated biases within 'GloVe' and 'Word2Vec' word embeddings. Euclidean distances were measured to assess relationships between psychiatric terms and demographic labels, and vector similarity functions were used to solve analogy questions relating to mental health. Results Our primary analysis of mental health terminology in GloVe and Word2Vec embeddings demonstrated significant biases with respect to religion, race, gender, nationality, sexuality and age. Our literature review returned 52 papers, of which none addressed all the areas of possible bias that we identify in model development. In addition, only one article existed on more than one research database, demonstrating the isolation of research within disciplinary silos and inhibiting cross-disciplinary collaboration or communication. Conclusion Our findings are relevant to professionals who wish to minimize the health inequalities that may arise as a result of AI and data-driven algorithms. We offer primary research identifying biases within these technologies and provide recommendations for avoiding these harms in the future. © 2020 Straw, Callison-Burch.

Lightme: analysing language in internet support groups for mental health,"Ferraro, G.; Loo Gee, B.; Ji, S.; Salvador-Carulla, L.","Background: Assisting moderators to triage harmful posts in Internet Support Groups is relevant to ensure its safe use. Automated text classification methods analysing the language expressed in posts of online forums is a promising solution. Methods: Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning technologies were used to build a triage post classifier using a dataset from Reachout.com mental health forum for young people. Results: When comparing with the state-of-the-art, a solution mainly based on features from lexical resources, received the best classification performance for the crisis posts (52%), which is the most severe class. Six salient linguistic characteristics were found when analysing the crisis post; (1) posts expressing hopelessness, (2) short posts expressing concise negative emotional responses, (3) long posts expressing variations of emotions, (4) posts expressing dissatisfaction with available health services, (5) posts utilising storytelling, and (6) posts expressing users seeking advice from peers during a crisis. Conclusion: It is possible to build a competitive triage classifier using features derived only from the textual content of the post. Further research needs to be done in order to translate our quantitative and qualitative findings into features, as it may improve overall performance. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2020,,Health Information Science and Systems,8,1,,,10.1007/s13755-020-00115-7,,#2393,Ferraro 2020,"",""
To honor our heroes: Analysis of the obituaries of Australians killed in action in WWI and WWII,"Cheong, M.; Alfano, M.","Obituaries represent a prominent way of expressing the human universal of grief. According to philosophers, obituaries are a ritualized way of evaluating both individuals who have passed away and the communities that helped to shape them. The basic idea is that you can tell what it takes to count as a good person of a particular type in a particular community by seeing how persons of that type are described and celebrated in their obituaries. Obituaries of those killed in conflict, in particular, are rich repositories of communal values, as they reflect the values and virtues that are admired and respected in individuals who are considered to be heroes in their communities. In this paper, we use natural language processing techniques to map the patterns of values and virtues attributed to Australian military personnel who were killed in action during World War I and World War II. Doing so reveals several clusters of values and virtues that tend to be attributed together. In addition, we use named entity recognition and geotagging the track the movements of these soldiers to various theatres of the wars, including North Africa, Europe, and the Pacific. © 2020 IEEE",2020,,Proceedings - International Conference on Pattern Recognition,,,6965-6972,,10.1109/ICPR48806.2021.9413145,,#2401,Cheong 2020,"",""
Biased Language Detection in Court Decisions,"Pinto, A.G.; Cardoso, H.L.; Duarte, I.M.; Warrot, C.V.; Sousa-Silva, R.","The Portuguese Commission for Citizenship and Gender Equality advocates that equality between men and women is a fundamental principle of the Portuguese Constitution.

Artificial Intelligence and Inclusion: Formerly Gang-Involved Youth as Domain Experts for Analyzing Unstructured Twitter Data,"Frey, W.R.; Patton, D.U.; Gaskell, M.B.; McGregor, K.A.","Mining social media data for studying the human condition has created new and unique challenges. When analyzing social media data from marginalized communities, algorithms lack the ability to accurately interpret off-line context, which may lead to dangerous assumptions about and implications for marginalized communities. To combat this challenge, we hired formerly gang-involved young people as domain experts for contextualizing social media data in order to create inclusive, community-informed algorithms. Utilizing data from the Gang Intervention and Computer Science Project—a comprehensive analysis of Twitter data from gang-involved youth in Chicago—we describe the process of involving formerly gang-involved young people in developing a new part-of-speech tagger and content classifier for a prototype natural language processing system that detects aggression and loss in Twitter data. We argue that involving young people as domain experts leads to more robust understandings of context, including localized language, culture, and events. These insights could change how data scientists approach the development of corpora and algorithms that affect people in marginalized communities and who to involve in that process. We offer a contextually driven interdisciplinary approach between social work and data science that integrates domain insights into the training of qualitative annotators and the production of algorithms for positive social impact. © The Author(s) 2018.",2020,,Social Science Computer Review,38,1,42-56,,10.1177/0894439318788314,,#2405,Frey 2020,"",""
Validation of an alcohol misuse classifier in hospitalized patients,"To, D.; Sharma, B.; Karnik, N.; Joyce, C.; Dligach, D.; Afshar, M.","Background: Current modes of identifying alcohol misuse in hospitalized patients rely on self-report questionnaires and diagnostic codes that have limitations, including low sensitivity. Information in the clinical notes of the electronic health record (EHR) may further augment the identification of alcohol misuse. Natural language processing (NLP) with supervised machine learning has been successful at analyzing clinical notes and identifying cases of alcohol misuse in trauma patients. METHODS: An alcohol misuse NLP classifier, previously developed on trauma patients who completed the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, was validated in a cohort of 1000 hospitalized patients at a large, tertiary health system between January 1, 2007 and September 1, 2017. The clinical notes were processed using the clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) guidelines for alcohol misuse were used during annotation of the medical records in our validation dataset. RESULTS: The alcohol misuse classifier had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.91 (95% CI 0.90–0.93) in the cohort of hospitalized patients. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 0.88 (95% CI 0.85–0.90), 0.78 (95% CI 0.74–0.82), 0.85 (95% CI 0.82–0.87), and 0.82 (95% CI 0.78–0.86), respectively. The Hosmer–Lemeshow Test (p = 0.13) demonstrates good model fit. Additionally, there was a dose-dependent response in alcohol consumption behaviors across increasing strata of predicted probabilities for alcohol misuse. CONCLUSION: The alcohol misuse NLP classifier had good discrimination and test characteristics in hospitalized patients. An approach using the clinical notes with NLP and supervised machine learning may better identify alcohol misuse cases than conventional methods solely relying on billing diagnostic codes. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",2020,,Alcohol,84,,49-55,,10.1016/j.alcohol.2019.09.008,,#2409,To 2020,"",""
Repurposing zileuton as a depression drug using an AI and in vitro approach,"Kubick, N.; Pajares, M.; Enache, I.; Manda, G.; Mickael, M.-E.","Repurposing drugs to target M1 macrophages inflammatory response in depression constitutes a bright alternative for commonly used antidepressants. Depression is a significant type of mood disorder, where patients suffer from pathological disturbances associated with a proinflammatory M1 macrophage phenotype. Presently, the most commonly used antidepressants such as Zoloft and Citalopram can reduce inflammation, but suffer from dangerous side effects without offering specificity toward macrophages. We employed a new strategy for drug repurposing based on the integration of RNA-seq analysis and text mining using deep neural networks. Our system employs a Google semantic AI universal encoder to compute sentences embedding. Sentences similarity is calculated using a sorting function to identify drug compounds. Then sentence relevance is computed using a custom-built convolution differential network. Our system highlighted the NRF2 pathway as a critical drug target to reprogram M1 macrophage response toward an anti-inflammatory profile (M2). Using our approach, we were also able to predict that lipoxygenase inhibitor drug zileuton could modulate NRF2 pathway in vitro. Taken together, our results indicate that reorienting zileuton usage to modulate M1 macrophages could be a novel and safer therapeutic option for treating depression. © 2020 by the authors.",2020,,Molecules,25,9,,,10.3390/molecules25092155,,#2410,Kubick 2020,"",""
Variation in Serious Illness Communication among Surgical Patients Receiving Palliative Care,"Udelsman, B.V.; Lee, K.C.; Lilley, E.J.; Chang, D.C.; Lindvall, C.; Cooper, Z.","Background: Natural language processing (NLP), a form of computer-assisted data abstraction, rapidly identifies serious illness communication domains such as code-status confirmation and goals of care (GOC) discussions within free-text notes, using a codebook of phrases. Differences in the phrases associated with palliative care for patients with different types of illness are unknown. Objective: To compare communication of code-status clarification and GOC discussions between patients with advanced pancreatic cancer undergoing palliative procedures and patients admitted with life-threatening trauma. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting/Subjects: Patients with in-hospital admissions within two academic medical centers. Measurements: Sensitivity and specificity of NLP-identified communication domains compared with manual review. Results: Among patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (n = 523), NLP identified code-status clarification in 54% of admissions and GOC discussions in 49% of admissions. The sensitivity and specificity for code-status clarification were 94% and 99% respectively, while the sensitivity and specificity for a GOC discussion were 93% and 100%, respectively. Using the same codebook in patients with life-threatening trauma (n = 2093), NLP identified code-status clarification in 25.9% of admissions and GOC discussions in 6.3% of admissions. While NLP identification had 100% specificity, the sensitivity for code-status clarification and GOC discussion was reduced to 86% and 50%, respectively. Adding dynamic phrases such as ""ongoing discussions"" and phrases related to ""family meetings"" increased the sensitivity of the NLP codebook for code status to 98% and for GOC discussions to 100%.

Clinician-recalled quoted speech in electronic health records and risk of suicide attempt: A case-crossover study,"Jayasinghe, L.; Bittar, A.; Dutta, R.; Stewart, R.","Clinician narrative style in electronic health records (EHR) has rarely been investigated. Clinicians sometimes record brief quotations from patients, possibly more frequently when higher risk is perceived. We investigated whether the frequency of quoted phrases in an EHR was higher in time periods closer to a suicide attempt. Design A case-crossover study was conducted in a large mental health records database. A natural language processing tool was developed using regular expression matching to identify text occurring within quotation marks in the EHR. Setting Electronic records from a large mental healthcare provider serving a geographic catchment of 1.3 million residents in South London were linked with hospitalisation data. Participants 1503 individuals were identified as having a hospitalised suicide attempt from 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2017 with at least one document in both the case period (1-30 days prior to admission) and the control period (61-90 days prior to admission). Outcome measures The number of quoted phrases in the control as compared with the case period. Results Both attended (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.08) and non-attended (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.26) clinical appointments were independently higher in the case compared with control period, while there was no difference in mental healthcare hospitalisation (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.01). In addition, there was no difference in the levels of quoted text between the comparison time periods (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.30). Conclusions This study successfully developed an algorithm to identify quoted speech in text fields from routine mental healthcare records.

A Quasi-Experimental Analysis of Lethal Means Assessment and Risk for Subsequent Suicide Attempts and Deaths,"Boggs, J.M.; Beck, A.; Ritzwoller, D.P.; Battaglia, C.; Anderson, H.D.; Lindrooth, R.C.","Background: Counseling on access to lethal means is highly recommended for patients with suicide risk, but there are no formal evaluations of its impact in real-world settings. Objective: Evaluate whether lethal means assessment reduces the likelihood of suicide attempt and death outcomes. Design: Quasi-experimental design using an instrumental variable to overcome confounding due to unmeasured patient characteristics that could influence provider decisions to deliver lethal means assessment. Setting: Kaiser Permanente Colorado, an integrated health system serving over 600,000 members, with comprehensive capture of all electronic health records, medical claims, and death information. Participants: Adult patients who endorsed suicide ideation on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) depression screener administered in behavioral health and primary care settings from 2010 to 2016. Interventions: Provider documentation of lethal means assessment in the text of clinical notes, collected using a validated Natural Language Processing program. Measurements: Main outcome was ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes for self-inflicted injury or suicide death within 180 days of index PHQ-9 event. Results: We found 33% of patients with suicide ideation reported on the PHQ-9 received lethal means assessment in the 30 days following identification. Lethal means assessment reduced the risk of a suicide attempt or death within 180 days from 3.3 to 0.83% (p =.034, 95% CI =.069–.9).

Temporal information extraction from mental health records to identify duration of untreated psychosis,"Viani, N.; Kam, J.; Yin, L.; Bittar, A.; Dutta, R.; Patel, R.; Stewart, R.; Velupillai, S.","Background: Duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) is an important clinical construct in the field of mental health, as longer DUP can be associated with worse intervention outcomes. DUP estimation requires knowledge about when psychosis symptoms first started (symptom onset), and when psychosis treatment was initiated. Electronic health records (EHRs) represent a useful resource for retrospective clinical studies on DUP, but the core information underlying this construct is most likely to lie in free text, meaning it is not readily available for clinical research. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a means to addressing this problem by automatically extracting relevant information in a structured form. As a first step, it is important to identify appropriate documents, i.e., those that are likely to include the information of interest. Next, temporal information extraction methods are needed to identify time references for early psychosis symptoms. This NLP challenge requires solving three different tasks: time expression extraction, symptom extraction, and temporal ""linking"". In this study, we focus on the first step, using two relevant EHR datasets. Results: We applied a rule-based NLP system for time expression extraction that we had previously adapted to a corpus of mental health EHRs from patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (first referrals). We extended this work by applying this NLP system to a larger set of documents and patients, to identify additional texts that would be relevant for our long-term goal, and developed a new corpus from a subset of these new texts (early intervention services). Furthermore, we added normalized value annotations (""2011-05"") to the annotated time expressions (""May 2011"") in both corpora. The finalized corpora were used for further NLP development and evaluation, with promising results (normalization accuracy 71-86%). To highlight the specificities of our annotation task, we also applied the final adapted NLP system to a different temporally annotated clinical corpus. Conclusions: Developing domain-specific methods is crucial to address complex NLP tasks such as symptom onset extraction and retrospective calculation of duration of a preclinical syndrome. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first clinical text resource annotated for temporal entities in the mental health domain. © 2020 The Author(s).",2020,,Journal of Biomedical Semantics,11,1,,,10.1186/s13326-020-00220-2,,#2425,Viani 2020,"",""
Understanding patient anxieties in the social media era: Qualitative analysis and natural language processing of an online male infertility community,"Osadchiy, V.; Mills, J.N.; Eleswarapu, S.V.","Background: Couples struggling with infertility are increasingly turning to the internet for infertility-related content and to connect with others. Most of the published data on infertility and the internet only address the experiences of women, with limited studies focusing exclusively on internet discussions on male factor infertility. Objective: The aim of this study was to understand the concerns and experiences of discussants on an online male infertility community and to provide insight into their perceptions of interactions with health care professionals. Methods: Using the large-scale data analytics tool BigQuery, we extracted all posts in the r/MaleInfertility community (877 members) of the social media website and discussion board Reddit from November 2017 to October 2018. We performed a qualitative thematic analysis and quantitative semantic analysis using Language Inquiry and Word Count 2015 of the extracted posts to identify dominant themes and subthemes of discussions. Descriptive statistics and semantic analytic Z-scores were computed. Results: From the analysis of 97 posts, notable themes and subthemes emerged: 70 (72%) posts shared personal experiences, including feeling emasculated or isolated or describing a negative (28/97, 29%), positive (13/97, 13%), or neutral (56/97, 58%) experience with a health care professional; 19% (18/97) of the posts posed questions about personal semen analysis results. On the basis of semantic analysis, posts by men had higher authenticity scores (Z=3.44; P<.001), suggesting more honest or personal texts, but lower clout scores (Z=4.57; P<.001), suggesting a more tentative or anxious style of writing, compared with posts by women. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this study represents the first evaluation of a social media community focused exclusively on male infertility using mixed methodology. These results suggest a role for physicians on social media to engage with patients and connect them to accurate resources, in addition to opportunities to improve in-office patient education. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

A deep learning architecture for psychometric natural language processing,"Ahmad, F.; Abbasi, A.; Li, J.; Dobolyi, D.G.; Netemeyer, R.G.; Clifford, G.D.; Chen, H.","Psychometric measures reflecting people's knowledge, ability, attitudes, and personality traits are critical for many real-world applications, such as e-commerce, health care, and cybersecurity. However, traditional methods cannot collect and measure rich psychometric dimensions in a timely and unobtrusive manner. Consequently, despite their importance, psychometric dimensions have received limited attention from the natural language processing and information retrieval communities. In this article, we propose a deep learning architecture, PyNDA, to extract psychometric dimensions from user-generated texts. PyNDA contains a novel representation embedding, a demographic embedding, a structural equation model (SEM) encoder, and a multitask learning mechanism designed to work in unison to address the unique challenges associated with extracting rich, sophisticated, and user-centric psychometric dimensions. Our experiments on three real-world datasets encompassing 11 psychometric dimensions, including trust, anxiety, and literacy, show that PyNDA markedly outperforms traditional feature-based classifiers as well as the state-of-the-art deep learning architectures. Ablation analysis reveals that each component of PyNDA significantly contributes to its overall performance. Collectively, the results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed architecture for facilitating rich psychometric analysis.

Predicting high-cost care in a mental health setting,"Colling, C.; Khondoker, M.; Patel, R.; Fok, M.; Harland, R.; Broadbent, M.; McCrone, P.; Stewart, R.","Background The density of information in digital health records offers new potential opportunities for automated prediction of cost-relevant outcomes. Aims We investigated the extent to which routinely recorded data held in the electronic health record (EHR) predict priority service outcomes and whether natural language processing tools enhance the predictions. We evaluated three high priority outcomes: in-patient duration, readmission following in-patient care and high service cost after first presentation. Method We used data obtained from a clinical database derived from the EHR of a large mental healthcare provider within the UK. We combined structured data with text-derived data relating to diagnosis statements, medication and psychiatric symptomatology. Predictors of the three different clinical outcomes were modelled using logistic regression with performance evaluated against a validation set to derive areas under receiver operating characteristic curves. Results In validation samples, the full models (using all available data) achieved areas under receiver operating characteristic curves between 0.59 and 0.85 (in-patient duration 0.63, readmission 0.59, high service use 0.85). Adding natural language processingderived data to the models increased the variance explained across all clinical scenarios (observed increase in r2 = 12 46%). Conclusions EHR data offer the potential to improve routine clinical predictions by utilising previously inaccessible data. Of our scenarios, prediction of high service use after initial presentation achieved the highest performance.  © 2019 The Royal College of Psychiatrists.",2020,,BJPsych Open,6,1,,,10.1192/bjo.2019.96,,#2430,Colling 2020,"",""
Automatic construction of a depression-domain lexicon based on microblogs: Text mining study,"Li, G.; Li, B.; Huang, L.; Hou, S.","Background: According to a World Health Organization report in 2017, there was almost one patient with depression among every 20 people in China. However, the diagnosis of depression is usually difficult in terms of clinical detection owing to slow observation, high cost, and patient resistance. Meanwhile, with the rapid emergence of social networking sites, people tend to share their daily life and disclose inner feelings online frequently, making it possible to effectively identify mental conditions using the rich text information. There are many achievements regarding an English web-based corpus, but for research in China so far, the extraction of language features from web-related depression signals is still in a relatively primary stage. Objective: The purpose of this study was to propose an effective approach for constructing a depression-domain lexicon. This lexicon will contain language features that could help identify social media users who potentially have depression. Our study also compared the performance of detection with and without our lexicon. Methods: We autoconstructed a depression-domain lexicon using Word2Vec, a semantic relationship graph, and the label propagation algorithm. These two methods combined performed well in a specific corpus during construction. The lexicon was obtained based on 111,052 Weibo microblogs from 1868 users who were depressed or nondepressed. During depression detection, we considered six features, and we used five classification methods to test the detection performance. Results: The experiment results showed that in terms of the F1 value, our autoconstruction method performed 1% to 6% better than baseline approaches and was more effective and steadier. When applied to detection models like logistic regression and support vector machine, our lexicon helped the models outperform by 2% to 9% and was able to improve the final accuracy of potential depression detection. Conclusions: Our depression-domain lexicon was proven to be a meaningful input for classification algorithms, providing linguistic insights on the depressive status of test subjects. We believe that this lexicon will enhance early depression detection in people on social media. Future work will need to be carried out on a larger corpus and with more complex methods.  © 2020 Genghao Li, Bing Li, Langlin Huang, Sibing Hou.",2020,,JMIR Medical Informatics,8,6,,,10.2196/17650,,#2431,Li 2020,"",""

The suicide-related conversations were posted by 7.8% of teenagers and 3.2% of adults in the study. Several critical differences were noted between teenagers and adults. A higher percentage of teenagers are: fearful of “the unknown” due to seizures (63% vs 12% adults), concerned about social consequences of seizures (30% vs 21%), and seek emotional support (29% vs 19%). In contrast, a significantly higher percentage of adults show a defeatist (“given up”) attitude compared to teenagers (42% vs 4%). There were important differences in the author's determined sentiments behind the conversations among teenagers and adults. Significance: In this first of its kind big data analysis of nearly a quarter-million digital conversations about epilepsy using machine learning, we found that teenagers engage in an online conversation about suicide more often than adults. There are some key differences in the attitudes and concerns, which may have implications for the treatment of younger patients with epilepsy. © 2020 Cleveland Clinic.

Transfer learning for risk classification of social media posts: Model evaluation study,"Howard, D.; Maslej, M.M.; Lee, J.; Ritchie, J.; Woollard, G.; French, L.","Background: Mental illness affects a significant portion of the worldwide population. Online mental health forums can provide a supportive environment for those afflicted and also generate a large amount of data that can be mined to predict mental health states using machine learning methods. Objective: This study aimed to benchmark multiple methods of text feature representation for social media posts and compare their downstream use with automated machine learning (AutoML) tools. We tested on datasets that contain posts labeled for perceived suicide risk or moderator attention in the context of self-harm. Specifically, we assessed the ability of the methods to prioritize posts that a moderator would identify for immediate response. Methods: We used 1588 labeled posts from the Computational Linguistics and Clinical Psychology (CLPsych) 2017 shared task collected from the Reachout.com forum. Posts were represented using lexicon-based tools, including Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner, Empath, and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, and also using pretrained artificial neural network models, including DeepMoji, Universal Sentence Encoder, and Generative Pretrained Transformer-1 (GPT-1). We used Tree-based Optimization Tool and Auto-Sklearn as AutoML tools to generate classifiers to triage the posts. Results: The top-performing system used features derived from the GPT-1 model, which was fine-tuned on over 150,000 unlabeled posts from Reachout.com. Our top system had a macroaveraged F1 score of 0.572, providing a new state-of-the-art result on the CLPsych 2017 task. This was achieved without additional information from metadata or preceding posts. Error analyses revealed that this top system often misses expressions of hopelessness. In addition, we have presented visualizations that aid in the understanding of the learned classifiers. Conclusions: In this study, we found that transfer learning is an effective strategy for predicting risk with relatively little labeled data and noted that fine-tuning of pretrained language models provides further gains when large amounts of unlabeled text are available. © Derek Howard, Marta M Maslej, Justin Lee, Jacob Ritchie, Geoffrey Woollard, Leon French.",2020,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,22,5,,,10.2196/15371,,#2438,Howard 2020,"",""
Using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to Identify Hospitalized Patients with Opioid Use Disorder,"Blackley, S.V.; MacPhaul, E.; Martin, B.; Song, W.; Suzuki, J.; Zhou, L.","Opioid use disorder (OUD) represents a global public health crisis that challenges classic clinical decision making. As existing hospital screening methods are resource-intensive, patients with OUD are significantly under-detected. An automated and accurate approach is needed to improve OUD identification so that appropriate care can be provided to these patients in a timely fashion. In this study, we used a large-scale clinical database from Mass General Brigham (MGB; formerly Partners HealthCare) to develop an OUD patient identification algorithm, using multiple machine learning methods. Working closely with an addiction psychiatrist, we developed a set of hand-crafted rules for identifying information suggestive of OUD from free-text clinical notes. We implemented a natural language processing (NLP)-based classification algorithm within the Medical Text Extraction, Reasoning and Mapping System (MTERMS) tool suite to automatically label patients as positive or negative for OUD based on these rules. We further used the NLP output as features to build multiple machine learning and a neural classifier. Our methods yielded robust performance for classifying hospitalized patients as positive or negative for OUD, with the best performing feature set and model combination achieving an F1 score of 0.97. These results show promise for the future development of a real-time tool for quickly and accurately identifying patients with OUD in the hospital setting. ©2020 AMIA - All rights reserved.",2020,,AMIA ...

Identifying Predictors of Suicide in Severe Mental Illness: A Feasibility Study of a Clinical Prediction Rule (Oxford Mental Illness and Suicide Tool or OxMIS),"Senior, M.; Burghart, M.; Yu, R.; Kormilitzin, A.; Liu, Q.; Vaci, N.; Nevado-Holgado, A.; Pandit, S.; Zlodre, J.; Fazel, S.","Background: Oxford Mental Illness and Suicide tool (OxMIS) is a brief, scalable, freely available, structured risk assessment tool to assess suicide risk in patients with severe mental illness (schizophrenia-spectrum disorders or bipolar disorder). OxMIS requires further external validation, but a lack of large-scale cohorts with relevant variables makes this challenging. Electronic health records provide possible data sources for external validation of risk prediction tools. However, they contain large amounts of information within free-text that is not readily extractable. In this study, we examined the feasibility of identifying suicide predictors needed to validate OxMIS in routinely collected electronic health records. Methods: In study 1, we manually reviewed electronic health records of 57 patients with severe mental illness to calculate OxMIS risk scores. In study 2, we examined the feasibility of using natural language processing to scale up this process. We used anonymized free-text documents from the Clinical Record Interactive Search database to train a named entity recognition model, a machine learning technique which recognizes concepts in free-text. The model identified eight concepts relevant for suicide risk assessment: medication (antidepressant/antipsychotic treatment), violence, education, self-harm, benefits receipt, drug/alcohol use disorder, suicide, and psychiatric admission. We assessed model performance in terms of precision (similar to positive predictive value), recall (similar to sensitivity) and F1 statistic (an overall performance measure). Results: In study 1, we estimated suicide risk for all patients using the OxMIS calculator, giving a range of 12 month risk estimates from 0.1-3.4%. For 13 out of 17 predictors, there was no missing information in electronic health records. For the remaining 4 predictors missingness ranged from 7-26%; to account for these missing variables, it was possible for OxMIS to estimate suicide risk using a range of scores. In study 2, the named entity recognition model had an overall precision of 0.77, recall of 0.90 and F1 score of 0.83. The concept with the best precision and recall was medication (precision 0.84, recall 0.96) and the weakest were suicide (precision 0.37), and drug/alcohol use disorder (recall 0.61). Conclusions: It is feasible to estimate suicide risk with the OxMIS tool using predictors identified in routine clinical records. Predictors could be extracted using natural language processing. However, electronic health records differ from other data sources, particularly for family history variables, which creates methodological challenges. © Copyright © 2020 Senior, Burghart, Yu, Kormilitzin, Liu, Vaci, Nevado-Holgado, Pandit, Zlodre and Fazel.",2020,,Frontiers in Psychiatry,11,,,,10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00268,,#2455,Senior 2020,"",""

Text mining analysis of teachers’ reports on student suicide in South Korea,"Lee, K.W.; Lee, D.; Hong, H.J.","A teacher as a suicide prevention gatekeeper has an important role in identifying suicide risks and warning signs in students. After a student’s suicide, teachers in Korea have to write a student suicide case report based on their direct and indirect observations. In particular, the section ’characteristic of student suicide’ of this report contains valuable information about the suicide; however, it is unstructured, and thus cannot be analyzed using conventional statistical methods. We aimed to identify the characteristics of observed Korean students, who have committed suicide, using text mining techniques as well as to improve our understanding of suicidal behaviors in the school contexts. Therefore, a series of text mining techniques: topic analysis, word correlation, and word frequency analysis, in three problem categories: health, school, and family problems, were used to analyze the characteristics of student suicides. Topic analysis showed that only 30% of the student suicide case reports identified problematic student characteristics related to suicide. Correlations between words showed that words in one problem category were often correlated with words in other problem categories. Frequency word analysis showed that the three problem categories varied across gender and school levels. These results provide interesting insights into the characteristics of suicides among Korean students and important implications for suicide intervention in the education field. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2020,,European Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,29,4,453-465,,10.1007/s00787-019-01361-1,,#2461,Lee 2020,"",""
Investigating Bullying as a Predictor of Suicidality in a Clinical Sample of Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder,"Holden, R.; Mueller, J.; McGowan, J.; Sanyal, J.; Kikoler, M.; Simonoff, E.; Velupillai, S.; Downs, J.","For typically developing adolescents, being bullied is associated with increased risk of suicidality. Although adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are at increased risk of both bullying and suicidality, there is very little research that examines the extent to which an experience of being bullied may increase suicidality within this specific population. To address this, we conducted a retrospective cohort study to investigate the longitudinal association between experiencing bullying and suicidality in a clinical population of 680 adolescents with ASD. Electronic health records of adolescents (13–17 years), using mental health services in South London, with a diagnosis of ASD were analyzed. Natural language processing was employed to identify mentions of bullying and suicidality in the free text fields of adolescents' clinical records. Cox regression analysis was employed to investigate the longitudinal relationship between bullying and suicidality outcomes. Reported experience of bullying in the first month of clinical contact was associated with an increased risk suicidality over the follow-up period (hazard ratio = 1.82; 95% confidence interval = 1.28–2.59). In addition, female gender, psychosis, affective disorder diagnoses, and higher intellectual ability were all associated with suicidality at follow-up. This study is the first to demonstrate the strength of longitudinal associations between bullying and suicidality in a clinical population of adolescents with ASD, using automated approaches to detect key life events within clinical records. Our findings provide support for identifying and dealing with bullying in schools, and for antibullying strategy's incorporation into wider suicide prevention programs for young people with ASD.

Using Topic Modeling to Detect and Describe Self-Injurious and Related Content on a Large-Scale Digital Platform,"Franz, P.J.; Nook, E.C.; Mair, P.; Nock, M.K.","Objective: Self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITBs) are a complex and enduring public health concern. Increasingly, teenagers use digital platforms to communicate about a range of mental health topics. These discussions may provide valuable information that can lead to insights about complex issues like SITBs. However, the field of clinical psychology currently lacks an easy-to-implement toolkit that can quickly gather information about SITBs from online sources. In the present study, we applied topic modeling, a natural language processing technique, to identify SITBs and related themes online, and we validated this approach using human coders. Method: We separately used topic modeling software and human coders to identify themes present in text from a popular online Internet support forum for teenagers. We then determined the degree to which results from the software's topic model aligned with themes identified by human coders. Results: We found that topic modeling detected SITBs and related themes in online discussions in a way that accurately distinguishes between relevant and irrelevant human-coded themes. Conclusions: This approach has the potential to drastically increase our understanding of SITBs and related issues discussed on digital platforms, as well as our ability to identify those at risk for such outcomes. © 2019 The American Association of Suicidology",2020,,Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior,50,1,5-18,,10.1111/sltb.12569,,#2474,Franz 2020,"",""
Suicidal ideation cause extraction from social texts,"Liu, D.; Fu, Q.; Wan, C.; Liu, X.; Jiang, T.; Liao, G.; Qiu, X.; Liu, R.","Suicide has become a major public health and social concern in the world. Suicidal ideation cause extraction (SICE) in social texts can provide support for suicide prevention. This article summarizes the research on suicidal ideation causes (SICs) through the use of psychological and sociological analysis. Then, a social text-based SIC dataset is constructed and analyzed statistically for various features. A CRF model is provided along with Char-BiLSTM-CRF, which uses concatenation of word embeddings and character embeddings as word representation inputs. Then, the effects on the task are explored by the word (W), part of speech (POS), dependence relationship (DP), suicidal psychology (PCS), emotion (ET), and language (LG) features in the CRF model. The experiment shows that the word features worked best. POS and DP can be somehow covered by word features. PCS, ET and LG features can improve the effect of SICE. It also shows that Char-BiLSTM-CRF is better than CRF in general, but CRF still has advantages in terms of precision. Adding character embeddings and CRF layers can significantly improve the extraction using Char-BiLSTM-CRF. The experiment also compared three-word embeddings with Word2vec, ELMo and BERT. Compared with Word2vec, the F-value of ELMo is increased by approximately 5% on average, and compared with ELMo, the C_F and E_F of BERT are increased by 3.5% and 2.3%, respectively.

Unwanted advances in higher education:Uncovering sexual harassment experiences in academia with text mining,"Karami, A.; White, C.N.; Ford, K.; Swan, S.; Yildiz Spinel, M.","Sexual harassment in academia is often a hidden problem because victims are usually reluctant to report their experiences. Recently, a web survey was developed to provide an opportunity to share thousands of sexual harassment experiences in academia. Using an efficient approach, this study collected and investigated more than 2,000 sexual harassment experiences to better understand these unwanted advances in higher education. This paper utilized text mining to disclose hidden topics and explore their weight across three variables: harasser gender, institution type, and victim's field of study. We mapped the topics on five themes drawn from the sexual harassment literature and found that more than 50% of the topics were assigned to the unwanted sexual attention theme. Fourteen percent of the topics were in the gender harassment theme, in which insulting, sexist, or degrading comments or behavior was directed towards women. Five percent of the topics involved sexual coercion (a benefit is offered in exchange for sexual favors), 5% involved sex discrimination, and 7% of the topics discussed retaliation against the victim for reporting the harassment, or for simply not complying with the harasser. Findings highlight the power differential between faculty and students, and the toll on students when professors abuse their power. While some topics did differ based on type of institution, there were no differences between the topics based on gender of harasser or field of study.

New informatics approaches including natural language processing (NLP) can be utilized to identify symptoms from narrative clinical documentation.

NLP performance was compared for symptom detection with International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9/10 codes and the performance of both methods were validated against manual chart review. From 1034 and 519 hemodialysis patients within BioMe and MIMIC-III databases, respectively, the most frequently identified symptoms by NLP were fatigue, pain, and nausea/vomiting. In BioMe, sensitivity for NLP (0.85 - 0.99) was higher than for ICD codes (0.09 - 0.59) for all symptoms with similar results in the BioMe validation cohort and MIMIC-III. ICD codes were significantly more specific for nausea/vomiting in BioMe and more specific for fatigue, depression, and pain in the MIMIC-III database. A majority of patients in both cohorts had four or more symptoms. Patients with more symptoms identified by NLP, ICD, and chart review had more clinical encounters. NLP had higher specificity in inpatient notes but higher sensitivity in outpatient notes and performed similarly across pain severity subgroups. Thus, NLP had higher sensitivity compared to ICD codes for identification of seven common hemodialysis-related symptoms, with comparable specificity between the two methods.

The Predictive Validity of Machine Learning Models in the Classification and Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder: State of the Art and Future Directions,"Ermers, N.J.; Hagoort, K.; Scheepers, F.E.","Major depressive disorder imposes a substantial disease burden worldwide, ranking as the third leading contributor to global disability. In spite of its ubiquity, classifying and treating depression has proven troublesome. One argument put forward to explain this predicament is the heterogeneity of patients diagnosed with the disorder. Recently, many areas of daily life have witnessed the surge of machine learning techniques, computational approaches to elucidate complex patterns in large datasets, which can be employed to make predictions and detect relevant clusters. Due to the multidimensionality at play in the pathogenesis of depression, it is suggested that machine learning could contribute to improving classification and treatment. In this paper, we investigated literature focusing on the use of machine learning models on datasets with clinical variables of patients diagnosed with depression to predict treatment outcomes or find more homogeneous subgroups. Identified studies based on best practices in the field are evaluated. We found 16 studies predicting outcomes (such as remission) and identifying clusters in patients with depression. The identified studies are mostly still in proof-of-concept phase, with small datasets, lack of external validation, and providing single performance metrics. Larger datasets, and models with similar variables present across these datasets, are needed to develop accurate and generalizable models. We hypothesize that harnessing natural language processing to obtain data ‘hidden' in clinical texts might prove useful in improving prediction models. Besides, researchers will need to focus on the conditions to feasibly implement these models to support psychiatrists and patients in their decision-making in practice.

Natural Language Processing-Based Quantification of the Mental State of Psychiatric Patients,"Mukherjee, S.S.; Yu, J.; Won, Y.; McClay, M.J.; Wang, L.; Rush, A.J.; Sarkar, J.","Psychiatric practice routinely uses semistructured and/or unstructured free text to record the behavior and mental state of patients. Many of these data are unstructured, lack standardization, and are difficult to use for analysis. Thus, it is difficult to quantitatively analyze a patient’s illness trajectory over time and his or her responsiveness to treatment, and it is also difficult to compare different patients quantitatively. In this article, experts in the field of psychiatry, along with machine learning models, have collaboratively transformed patient data available in status assessments generated by physicians into binary vector representations. Data from patients with mental health disorders collected within a real-world clinical setting from one of the largest behavioral electronic health record (EHR) systems in the United States have been used for generating these representations. The binary vector representation of these health records is shown to be useful in various clinical tasks, such as disease phenotyping, characterizing the suicidality of patients, and inferring diagnoses. To summarize, this approach can transform semistructured free-text summaries of patients’ status assessments into a structured, quantifiable format, which enriches the data that reside within EHR systems. This allows for effective intra-and interpatient quantifications and comparisons, which are much needed in the field of mental health. With the aid of these binary representations, patients’ mental states can be systematically tracked over time, as can their responses to medications at the individual and population levels. © 2020 Computational Psychiatry, Inc.",2020,,Computational Psychiatry,4,,76-106,,10.1162/cpsy_a_00030,,#2494,Mukherjee 2020,"",""
Prevalence and incidence of clinical outcomes in patients presenting to secondary mental health care with mood instability and sleep disturbance,"McDonald, K.; Smith, T.; Broadbent, M.; Patel, R.; Geddes, J.R.; Saunders, K.E.A.","BACKGROUND: Mood instability and sleep disturbance are common symptoms in people with mental illness. Both features are clinically important and associated with poorer illness trajectories. We compared clinical outcomes in people presenting to secondary mental health care with mood instability and/or sleep disturbance with outcomes in people without either mood instability or sleep disturbance. METHODS: Data were from electronic health records of 31,391 patients ages 16-65 years presenting to secondary mental health services between 2008 and 2016. Mood instability and sleep disturbance were identified using natural language processing. Prevalence of mood instability and sleep disturbance were estimated at baseline. Incidence rate ratios were estimates for clinical outcomes including psychiatric diagnoses, prescribed medication, and hospitalization within 2-years of presentation in persons with mood instability and/or sleep disturbance compared to individuals without either symptom. RESULTS: Mood instability was present in 9.58%, and sleep disturbance in 26.26% of patients within 1-month of presenting to secondary mental health services. Compared with individuals without either symptom, those with mood instability and sleep disturbance showed significantly increased incidence of prescription of any psychotropic medication (incidence rate ratios [IRR] = 7.04, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 6.53-7.59), and hospitalization (IRR = 5.32, 95% CI 5.32, 4.67-6.07) within 2-years of presentation. Incidence rates of most clinical outcomes were considerably increased among persons with both mood instability and sleep disturbance, relative to persons with only one symptom. CONCLUSIONS: Mood instability and sleep disturbance are present in a wide range of mental disorders, beyond those in which they are conventionally considered to be symptoms. They are associated with poor outcomes, particularly when they occur together. The poor prognosis associated with mood instability and sleep disorder may be, in part, because they are often treated as secondary symptoms.

Methods: Natural language processing (NLP) was applied to qualitative patient response data from two large-scale international cross-sectional surveys conducted in the USA and countries outside of the USA (non-USA; Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK). Descriptive analysis was conducted on patient responses to an open-ended question on how they felt about their AD and how the disease affected their life. Character length, word count, and stop word (common words) count were evaluated; centrality analysis identified concepts that were most strongly interlinked. Results: Patients with AD in all countries were most frequently impacted by itch, pain, and embarrassment across all levels of disease severity. Patients with moderate-to-severe AD were more likely than patients with mild AD to describe sleep disturbances, fatigue, and feelings of depression, anxiety, and a lack of hope that were directly associated with AD. Centrality analysis revealed sleep disturbance was strongly linked with itch. Collectively, these concepts revealed that patients with AD are impacted by both physical and emotional burdens that are intricately connected. Conclusions: Qualitative data from NLP, being more patient-centric than data from clinical standardized measures, provide a more comprehensive view of the burden of AD to inform disease management. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020,,Dermatology and Therapy,10,2,297-305,,10.1007/s13555-020-00356-0,,#2500,Falissard 2020,"",""
Psychiatric stressor recognition from clinical notes to reveal association with suicide,"Zhang, Y.; Zhang, O.R.; Li, R.; Flores, A.; Selek, S.; Zhang, X.Y.; Xu, H.","Suicide takes the lives of nearly a million people each year and it is a tremendous economic burden globally. One important type of suicide risk factor is psychiatric stress. Prior studies mainly use survey data to investigate the association between suicide and stressors. Very few studies have investigated stressor data in electronic health records, mostly due to the data being recorded in narrative text. This study takes the initiative to automatically extract and classify psychiatric stressors from clinical text using natural language processing–based methods. Suicidal behaviors were also identified by keywords. Then, a statistical association analysis between suicide ideations/attempts and stressors extracted from a clinical corpus is conducted. Experimental results show that our natural language processing method could recognize stressor entities with an F-measure of 89.01 percent. Mentions of suicidal behaviors were identified with an F-measure of 97.3 percent. The top three significant stressors associated with suicide are health, pressure, and death, which are similar to previous studies. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using natural language processing approaches to unlock information from psychiatric notes in electronic health record, to facilitate large-scale studies about associations between suicide and psychiatric stressors. © The Author(s) 2018.",2019,,Health Informatics Journal,25,4,1846-1862,,10.1177/1460458218796598,,#2506,Zhang 2019,"",""

Identification of genes related to mental disorders by text mining,"Wu, Y.; Dang, M.; Li, H.; Jin, X.; Yang, W.","Mental disorders are important diseases with a high prevalence rate in the general population. Common mental disorders are complex diseases with high heritability, and their pathogenesis is the result of interactions between genetic and environmental factors. However, the relationship between mental disorders and genes is complex and difficult to evaluate. Additionally, some mental disorders involve numerous genes, and a single gene can also be associated with different types of mental disorders.This study used text mining (including word frequency analysis, cluster analysis, and association analysis) of the PubMed database to identify genes related to mental disorders.Word frequency analysis revealed 52 high-frequency genes important in studies of mental disorders. Cluster analysis showed that 5-HTT, SLC6A4, and MAOA are common genetic factors in most mental disorders; the intra-group genes in each cluster were highly correlated. Some mental disorders may have common genetic factors; for example, there may be common genetic factors between 'Affective Disorders' and 'Schizophrenia.' Association analysis revealed 35 frequent itemsets and 25 association rules, indicating close associations among genes. The results of association rules showed that CCK, MAOA, and 5-HTT are the most closely related.We used text mining technology to analyze genes related to mental disorders to further summarize and clarify the relationships between mental disorders and genes as well as identify potential relationships, providing a foundation for future experiments. The results of the associative analysis also provide a reference for multi-gene studies of mental disorders.",2019,,Medicine,98,42,e17504,,10.1097/MD.0000000000017504,,#2520,Wu 2019,"",""
The association between neighbourhood characteristics and physical victimisation in men and women with mental disorders,"Bhavsar, V.; Sanyal, J.; Patel, R.; Shetty, H.; Velupillai, S.; Stewart, R.; Broadbent, M.; Maccabe, J.H.; Das-Munshi, J.; Howard, L.M.","Background How neighbourhood characteristics affect the physical safety of people with mental illness is unclear.Aims To examine neighbourhood effects on physical victimisation towards people using mental health services.Method We developed and evaluated a machine-learning-derived free-text-based natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to ascertain clinical text referring to physical victimisation. This was applied to records on all patients attending National Health Service mental health services in Southeast London. Sociodemographic and clinical data, and diagnostic information on use of acute hospital care (from Hospital Episode Statistics, linked to Clinical Record Interactive Search), were collected in this group, defined as 'cases' and concurrently sampled controls. Multilevel logistic regression models estimated associations (odds ratios, ORs) between neighbourhood-level fragmentation, crime, income deprivation, and population density and physical victimisation.Results Based on a human-rated gold standard, the NLP algorithm had a positive predictive value of 0.92 and sensitivity of 0.98 for (clinically recorded) physical victimisation. A 1 s.d. increase in neighbourhood crime was accompanied by a 7% increase in odds of physical victimisation in women and an 13% increase in men (adjusted OR (aOR) for women: 1.07, 95% CI 1.01-1.14, aOR for men: 1.13, 95% CI 1.06-1.21, P for gender interaction, 0.218). Although small, adjusted associations for neighbourhood fragmentation appeared greater in magnitude for women (aOR = 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.11) than men, where this association was not statistically significant (aOR = 1.00, 95% CI 0.95-1.04, P for gender interaction, 0.096).

Efficient reuse of natural language processing models for phenotype-mention identification in free-text electronic medical records: A phenotype embedding approach,"Wu, H.; Hodgson, K.; Dyson, S.; Morley, K.I.; Ibrahim, Z.M.; Iqbal, E.; Stewart, R.; Dobson, R.J.B.; Sudlow, C.","Background: Much effort has been put into the use of automated approaches, such as natural language processing (NLP), to mine or extract data from free-text medical records in order to construct comprehensive patient profiles for delivering better health care. Reusing NLP models in new settings, however, remains cumbersome, as it requires validation and retraining on new data iteratively to achieve convergent results. Objective: The aim of this work is to minimize the effort involved in reusing NLP models on free-text medical records. Methods: We formally define and analyze the model adaptation problem in phenotype-mention identification tasks. We identify “duplicate waste” and “imbalance waste,” which collectively impede efficient model reuse. We propose a phenotype embedding–based approach to minimize these sources of waste without the need for labelled data from new settings. Results: We conduct experiments on data from a large mental health registry to reuse NLP models in four phenotype-mention identification tasks. The proposed approach can choose the best model for a new task, identifying up to 76% waste (duplicate waste), that is, phenotype mentions without the need for validation and model retraining and with very good performance (93%-97% accuracy). It can also provide guidance for validating and retraining the selected model for novel language patterns in new tasks, saving around 80% waste (imbalance waste), that is, the effort required in “blind” model-adaptation approaches. Conclusions: Adapting pretrained NLP models for new tasks can be more efficient and effective if the language pattern landscapes of old settings and new settings can be made explicit and comparable. Our experiments show that the phenotype-mention embedding approach is an effective way to model language patterns for phenotype-mention identification tasks and that its use can guide efficient NLP model reuse. ©Honghan Wu, Karen Hodgson, Sue Dyson, Katherine I Morley, Zina M Ibrahim, Ehtesham Iqbal, Robert Stewart, Richard JB Dobson, Cathie Sudlow.",2019,,JMIR Medical Informatics,7,4,,,10.2196/14782,,#2527,Wu 2019,"",""
Suicidal Tendency on Social Media by Using Text Mining,"Gupta, P.; Kaushik, B.","With a growth in the use of the social media, we have witnessed a positive connection between the demonstration of Suicidal ideation on social networking sites (such as Twitter) and the suicidal cases.

Text-mining forma mentis networks reconstruct public perception of the STEM gender gap in social media,"Stella, M.","Mindset reconstruction maps how individuals structure and perceive knowledge, a map unfolded here by investigating language and its cognitive reflection in the human mind, i.e., the mental lexicon. Textual forma mentis networks (TFMN) are glass boxes introduced for extracting and understanding mindsets' structure (in Latin forma mentis) from textual data. Combining network science, psycholinguistics and Big Data, TFMNs successfully identified relevant concepts in benchmark texts, without supervision. Once validated, TFMNs were applied to the case study of distorted mindsets about the gender gap in science. Focusing on social media, this work analysed 10,000 tweets mostly representing individuals' opinions at the beginning of posts. ``Gender'' and ``gap'' elicited a mostly positive, trustful and joyous perception, with semantic associates that: celebrated successful female scientists, related gender gap to wage differences, and hoped for a future resolution. The perception of ``woman'' highlighted jargon of sexual harassment and stereotype threat (a form of implicit cognitive bias) about women in science ``sacrificing personal skills for success''. The semantic frame of ``man'' highlighted awareness of the myth of male superiority in science. No anger was detected around ``person'', suggesting that tweets got less tense around genderless terms. No stereotypical perception of ``scientist'' was identified online, differently from real-world surveys. This analysis thus identified that Twitter discourse mostly starting conversations promoted a majorly stereotype-free, positive/trustful perception of gender disparity, aimed at closing the gap. Hence, future monitoring against discriminating language should focus on other parts of conversations like users' replies. TFMNs enable new ways for monitoring collective online mindsets, offering data-informed ground for policy making. © 2020 PeerJ Inc.",2020,,PeerJ Computer Science,6,,,,10.7717/PEERJ-CS.295,,#2539,Stella 2020,"",""
Automatic detection of eating disorder-related social media posts that could benefit from a mental health intervention,"Yan, H.; Fitzsimmons-Craft, E.E.; Goodman, M.; Krauss, M.; Das, S.; Cavazos-Rehg, P.","Objective: Online forums allow people to semi-anonymously discuss their struggles, often leading to greater honesty. This characteristic makes forums valuable for identifying users in need of immediate help from mental health professionals. Because it would be impractical to manually review every post on a forum to identify users in need of urgent help, there may be value to developing algorithms for automatically detecting posts reflecting a heightened risk of imminent plans to engage in disordered behaviors. Method: Five natural language processing techniques (tools to perform computational text analysis) were used on a data set of 4,812 posts obtained from six eating disorder-related subreddits. Two licensed clinical psychologists labeled 53 of these posts, deciding whether or not the content of the post indicated that its author needed immediate professional help. The remaining 4,759 posts were unlabeled. Results: Each of the five techniques ranked the 50 posts most likely to be intervention-worthy (the “top-50”).

Assessing the Heterogeneity of Complaints Related to Tinnitus and Hyperacusis from an Unsupervised Machine Learning Approach: An Exploratory Study,"Palacios, G.; Noreña, A.; Londero, A.","Introduction: Subjective tinnitus (ST) and hyperacusis (HA) are common auditory symptoms that may become incapacitating in a subgroup of patients who thereby seek medical advice. Both conditions can result from many different mechanisms, and as a consequence, patients may report a vast repertoire of associated symptoms and comorbidities that can reduce dramatically the quality of life and even lead to suicide attempts in the most severe cases. The present exploratory study is aimed at investigating patients’ symptoms and complaints using an in-depth statistical analysis of patients’ natural narratives in a real-life environment in which, thanks to the anonymization of contributions and the peer-to-peer interaction, it is supposed that the wording used is totally free of any self-limitation and self-censorship. Methods: We applied a purely statistical, non-supervised machine learning approach to the analysis of patients’ verbatim exchanged on an Internet forum. After automated data extraction, the dataset has been preprocessed in order to make it suitable for statistical analysis. We used a variant of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm to reveal clusters of symptoms and complaints of HA patients (topics). The probability of distribution of words within a topic uniquely characterizes it. The convergence of the log-likelihood of the LDA-model has been reached after 2,000 iterations. Several statistical parameters have been tested for topic modeling and word relevance factor within each topic. Results: Despite a rather small dataset, this exploratory study demonstrates that patients’ free speeches available on the Internet constitute a valuable material for machine learning and statistical analysis aimed at categorizing ST/HA complaints. The LDA model with K = 15 topics seems to be the most relevant in terms of relative weights and correlations with the capability to individualizing subgroups of patients displaying specific characteristics. The study of the relevance factor may be useful to unveil weak but important signals that are present in patients’ narratives. Discussion/Conclusion: We claim that the LDA non-supervised approach would permit to gain knowledge on the patterns of ST- and HA-related complaints and on patients’ centered domains of interest. The merits and limitations of the LDA algorithms are compared with other natural language processing methods and with more conventional methods of qualitative analysis of patients’ output. Future directions and research topics emerging from this innovative algorithmic analysis are proposed. © 2020 The Author(s) Published by S.

Objective: To develop and validate an automatic text-processing pipeline for geospatial and temporal analysis of opioid-mentioning social media chatter. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional, population-based study was conducted from December 1, 2017, to August 31, 2019, and used more than 3 years of publicly available social media posts on Twitter, dated from January 1, 2012, to October 31, 2015, that were geolocated in Pennsylvania. Opioid-mentioning tweets were extracted using prescription and illicit opioid names, including street names and misspellings. Social media posts (tweets) (n = 9006) were manually categorized into 4 classes, and training and evaluation of several machine learning algorithms were performed. Temporal and geospatial patterns were analyzed with the best-performing classifier on unlabeled data. Main Outcomes and Measures: Pearson and Spearman correlations of county- and substate-level abuse-indicating tweet rates with opioid overdose death rates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention WONDER database and with 4 metrics from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health for 3 years were calculated. Classifier performances were measured through microaveraged F1 scores (harmonic mean of precision and recall) or accuracies and 95% CIs. Results: A total of 9006 social media posts were annotated, of which 1748 (19.4%) were related to abuse, 2001 (22.2%) were related to information, 4830 (53.6%) were unrelated, and 427 (4.7%) were not in the English language. Yearly rates of abuse-indicating social media post showed statistically significant correlation with county-level opioid-related overdose death rates (n = 75) for 3 years (Pearson r = 0.451, P <.001; Spearman r = 0.331, P =.004). Abuse-indicating tweet rates showed consistent correlations with 4 NSDUH metrics (n = 13) associated with nonmedical prescription opioid use (Pearson r = 0.683, P =.01; Spearman r = 0.346, P =.25), illicit drug use (Pearson r = 0.850, P <.001; Spearman r = 0.341, P =.25), illicit drug dependence (Pearson r = 0.937, P <.001; Spearman r = 0.495, P =.09), and illicit drug dependence or abuse (Pearson r = 0.935, P <.001; Spearman r = 0.401, P =.17) over the same 3-year period, although the tests lacked power to demonstrate statistical significance. A classification approach involving an ensemble of classifiers produced the best performance in accuracy or microaveraged F1 score (0.726; 95% CI, 0.708-0.743).

However, strategies for applying standard self-report scales for multiaxial assessment have not been well-studied, particularly where the aim is to support both categorical and dimensional phenotypes. Methods We propose a method for applying natural language processing to derive dimensional measures of psychiatric symptoms from questionnaire data. We utilized nine self-report symptom measures drawn from a large cellular biobanking study that enrolled individuals with mood and psychotic disorders, as well as healthy controls. To summarize questionnaire results we used word embeddings, a technique to represent words as numeric vectors preserving semantic and syntactic meaning. A low-dimensional approximation to the embedding space was used to derive the proposed succinct summary of symptom profiles. To validate our embedding-based disease profiles, these were compared to presence or absence of axis I diagnoses derived from structured clinical interview, and to objective neurocognitive testing. Results Unsupervised and supervised classification to distinguish presence/absence of axis I disorders using survey-level embeddings remained discriminative, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve up to 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.74,0.91) using Gaussian mixture modeling, and cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.91, 95% CI (0.88,0.94) using logistic regression. Derived symptom measures and estimated Research Domain Criteria scores also associated significantly with performance on neurocognitive tests. Conclusions Our results support the potential utility of deriving dimensional phenotypic measures in psychiatric illness through the use of word embeddings, while illustrating the challenges in identifying truly orthogonal dimensions. © 2020 Sonabend W. et al.

Machine Learning of Concepts Hard Even for Humans: The Case of Online Depression Forums,"Németh, R.; Sik, D.; Máté, F.","Social scientists of mixed-methods research have traditionally used human annotators to classify texts according to some predefined knowledge. The “big data” revolution, the fast growth of digitized texts in recent years brings new opportunities but also new challenges. In our research project, we aim to examine the potential for natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand the individual framing of depression in online forums. In this paper, we introduce a part of this project experimenting with NLP classification (supervised machine learning) method, which is capable of classifying large digital corpora according to various discourses on depression. Our question was whether an automated method can be applied to sociological problems outside the scope of hermeneutically more trivial business applications. The present article introduces our learning path from the difficulties of human annotation to the hermeneutic limitations of algorithmic NLP methods. We faced our first failure when we experienced significant inter-annotator disagreement. In response to the failure, we moved to the strategy of intersubjective hermeneutics (interpretation through consensus). The second failure arose because we expected the machine to effectively learn from the human-annotated sample despite its hermeneutic limitations. The machine learning seemed to work appropriately in predicting bio-medical and psychological framing, but it failed in case of sociological framing. These results show that the sociological discourse about depression is not as well founded as the biomedical and the psychological discourses—a conclusion which requires further empirical study in the future. An increasing part of machine learning solution is based on human annotation of semantic interpretation tasks, and such human-machine interactions will probably define many more applications in the future. Our paper shows the hermeneutic limitations of “big data” text analytics in the social sciences, and highlights the need for a better understanding of the use of annotated textual data and the annotation process itself. © The Author(s) 2020.",2020,,International Journal of Qualitative Methods,19,,,,10.1177/1609406920949338,,#2568,Németh 2020,"",""
Automatic extraction and assessment of lifestyle exposures for Alzheimer's disease using natural language processing,"Zhou, X.; Wang, Y.; Sohn, S.; Therneau, T.M.; Liu, H.; Knopman, D.S.","Introduction: Previous biomedical studies identified many lifestyle exposures that could possibly represent risk factors for dementia in general or dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). These lifestyle exposures are mainly mentioned in free-text electronic health records (EHRs). However, automatic extraction and assessment of these exposures using EHRs remains understudied. Methods: A natural language processing (NLP) approach was adopted to extract lifestyle exposures and intervention strategies from the clinical notes of 260 patients with clinical diagnoses of AD dementia and 260 age-matched cognitively unimpaired persons. Statistics of lifestyle exposures were compared between these two groups. The mapping results of the NLP extraction were evaluated by comparing the results with data captured independently by clinicians. Results: Thirty out of fifty-five potentially relevant lifestyle exposures were mentioned in our clinical note dataset. Twenty-two dietary factors and three substance abuses that were potentially relevant were not found in clinical notes. Patients with AD dementia were significantly exposed to more of the potential risk factors compared to the cognitively unimpaired subjects (χ2 = 120.31, p-value < 0.001). The average accuracy of the automated extraction was 74.0% in comparison with the manual review of randomly selected 50 sample documents. Discussion and conclusion: We illustrated the feasibility of NLP techniques for the automated evaluation of a large number lifestyle habits using free-text EHR data. We found that AD dementia patients were exposed to more of the potential risk factors than the comparison group. Our results also demonstrated the feasibility and accuracy of investigating putative risk factors using NLP techniques. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",2019,,International Journal of Medical Informatics,130,,,,10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2019.08.003,,#2574,Zhou 2019,"",""

Changes in mortality involving extended-release and long-acting opioids after implementation of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy,"Black, J.C.; Bau, G.E.; Rosen, T.; Cepeda, M.S.; Wedin, G.P.; Green, J.L.; Dart, R.C.","Objective. To assess changes in mortality rates in extended-release and long-acting (ER/LA) opioid analgesics after the implementation of the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). Setting. All drug poisoning deaths in three states: Florida, Oregon, and Washington. Data were obtained through state vital records offices and the Researched Abuse, Diversion and Addiction-Related Surveillance System Medical Examiner Program. Methods. Using cause-of-death literal text from death certificates, individual opioid active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) involved in each death were identified using rules-based natural language processing. Population-adjusted and prescriptions dispensed–adjusted mortality rates were calculated for all ER/LA opioid analgesic and individual opioid APIs. Rates before and after implementation of the REMS were compared. Rate changes were compared with rates from two APIs with little or no inclusion in the REMS: benzodiazepines and hydrocodone. Results. The mean ER/LA opioid analgesic population-adjusted mortality rate significantly decreased in all three states (FL: P ¼ 0.003; OR: P ¼ 0.003; WA: P < 0.001). Mortality rates for benzodiazepines and hydrocodone also decreased and were not statistically different. Significant heterogeneity in mortality rates of individual opioids was observed between the three states. When adjusted for prescription volume, the ER/LA opioid analgesic mortality rate decreased in all three states, but was significant only for Washington (P < 0.001). Conclusions. The population-adjusted mortality rate of ER/ LA opioid analgesics has decreased in three states. Notably, the contributions to mortality rates by individual opioid analgesics were not uniform across the three states in this study. However, these changes were not generally distinct from changes in mortality rates where comparator substances were involved. © 2019 American Academy of Pain Medicine.",2020,,Pain Medicine (United States),21,1,92-100,,10.1093/pm/pnz031,,#2584,Black 2020,"",""
An automated text mining approach for classifying mental-ill health incidents from police incident logs for data-driven intelligence,"Haleem, M.S.; Han, L.; Harding, P.J.; Ellison, M.","Data-driven intelligence can play a pivotal role in enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of police service provision. Despite of police organizations being a rich source of qualitative data (present in less formally structured formats, such as the text logs), little work has been done in automating steps to allow this data to feed into intelligence-led policing tasks, such as demand analysis/prediction. This paper examines the use of police incident logs to better estimate the demand of officers across all incidents, with particular respect to the cases where mental-ill health played a primary part. Persons suffering from mental-ill health are significantly more likely to come into contact with the police, but statistics relating to how much actual police time is spent dealing with this type of incident are highly variable and often subjective. We present a novel deep learning based text mining approach, which allows accurate extraction of mental-ill health related incidents from police incident logs. The data gained from these automated analyses can enable both strategic and operational planning within police forces, allowing policy makers to develop long term strategies to tackle this issue, and to better plan for day-today demand on services.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) applied to Electronic Health Records (EHRs) presents an opportunity to create large datasets to facilitate research in this area. This is a challenging endeavour however, because of the wide range of ways in which these symptoms are recorded, and the overlap of terms used to describe OCS with those used to describe other conditions. We developed an NLP algorithm to extract OCS information from a large mental healthcare EHR data resource at the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust using its Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) facility. We extracted documents from individuals who had received a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder. These text documents, annotated by human coders, were used for developing and refining the NLP algorithm (600 documents) with an additional set reserved for final validation (300 documents). The developed NLP algorithm utilized a rules-based approach to identify each of symptoms associated with OCS, and then combined them to determine the overall number of instances of OCS. After its implementation, the algorithm was shown to identify OCS with a precision and recall (with 95% confidence intervals) of 0.77 (0.65–0.86) and 0.67 (0.55–0.77) respectively. The development of this application demonstrated the potential to extract complex symptomatic data from mental healthcare EHRs using NLP to facilitate further analyses of these clinical symptoms and their relevance for prognosis and intervention response. © 2019, The Author(s).",2019,,Scientific Reports,9,1,,,10.1038/s41598-019-49165-2,,#2589,Chandran 2019,"",""
A Natural Language Process-Based Framework for Automatic Association Word Extraction,"Hu, Z.; Luo, J.; Zhang, C.; Li, W.","Word association, revealing mental representations and connections of human, has been widely studied in psychology. However, the scale of available associative cue-response words is severely restricted due to the traditional manually collecting methodology. Meanwhile, with the tremendous success in Natural Language Process (NLP) tasks, an extremely large amount of plain texts can be easily acquired. This suggests an insight about the potential to find association words automatically from the text corpus instead of manually collection. As an original attempt, this paper takes a small step toward proposing a deep learning based framework for automatic association word extraction. The framework mainly consists of two stages of association word detection and machine association network construction. In particular, attention mechanism based Reading Comprehension (RC) algorithm is explored to find valuable association words automatically. To validate the value of the extracted association words, the correlation coefficient between semantic similarities of machine and human association words is introduced as an effective measurement for evaluating association consistence. The experiments are conducted on two text datasets from which together about $20k$ association words, more than the existing largest human association word dataset, are finally derived. The experiment further verifies that the machine association words are generally consistent with human association words with respect to semantic similarity, which highlights the promising utilization of the machine association words in the future researches of both psychology and NLP. © 2013 IEEE.",2020,,IEEE Access,8,,1986-1997,,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2962154,,#2590,Hu 2020,"",""

Predicting depression symptoms in an Arabic psychological forum,"Alghamdi, N.S.; Hosni Mahmoud, H.A.; Abraham, A.; Alanazi, S.A.; García-Hernández, L.","Recently, social media platforms have been widely used as a communication tool on social networks. Many users have utilized these platforms to reflect their personal lives. These users differ in terms of background, language, age, and educational level. The close relationship between these platforms and their users has created rich information that is related to these users and can be exploited by researchers. Their posts can be analysed using natural language processing (NLP) to predict psychological traits such as depression. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has utilized social media to predict mental health disorders in Arabic posts, especially depression. Therefore, in this study, we investigate the application of natural language processing and machine learning on Arabic text for the prediction of depression, and we evaluate and compare the performance. Our research method is based on the collection of Arabic text from online forums and the application of either a lexicon-based approach or a machine-learning-based approach. In the former approach, the ArabDep lexicon is created, and a rule-based algorithm is used to predict depression symptoms using the created lexicon; however, in the latter approach, the data are annotated with the help of a psychologist, text features are extracted from Arabic posts, and machine learning algorithms are ultimately applied to predict depression symptoms.

Understanding user experience: Exploring participants'messages with a web-based behavioral health intervention for adolescents with chronic pain,"Chen, A.T.; Swaminathan, A.; Kearns, W.R.; Alberts, N.M.; Law, E.F.; Palermo, T.M.","Background: Delivery of behavioral health interventions on the internet offers many benefits, including accessibility, cost-effectiveness, convenience, and anonymity. In recent years, an increased number of internet interventions have been developed, targeting a range of conditions and behaviors, including depression, pain, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and eating disorders. Human support (coaching) is a common component of internet interventions that is intended to boost engagement; however, little is known about how participants interact with coaches and how this may relate to their experience with the intervention. By examining the data that participants produce during an intervention, we can characterize their interaction patterns and refine treatments to address different needs. Objective: In this study, we employed text mining and visual analytics techniques to analyze messages exchanged between coaches and participants in an internet-delivered pain management intervention for adolescents with chronic pain and their parents. Methods: We explored the main themes in coaches' and participants' messages using an automated textual analysis method, topic modeling. We then clustered participants' messages to identify subgroups of participants with similar engagement patterns. Results: First, we performed topic modeling on coaches' messages. The themes in coaches' messages fell into 3 categories: Treatment Content, Administrative and Technical, and Rapport Building. Next, we employed topic modeling to identify topics from participants' message histories. Similar to the coaches' topics, these were subsumed under 3 high-level categories: Health Management and Treatment Content, Questions and Concerns, and Activities and Interests. Finally, the cluster analysis identified 4 clusters, each with a distinguishing characteristic: Assignment-Focused, Short Message Histories, Pain-Focused, and Activity-Focused. The name of each cluster exemplifies the main engagement patterns of that cluster. Conclusions: In this secondary data analysis, we demonstrated how automated text analysis techniques could be used to identify messages of interest, such as questions and concerns from users. In addition, we demonstrated how cluster analysis could be used to identify subgroups of individuals who share communication and engagement patterns, and in turn facilitate personalization of interventions for different subgroups of patients.

Diagnostic algorithms to study post-concussion syndrome using electronic health records: Validating a method to capture an important patient population,"Dennis, J.; Yengo-Kahn, A.M.; Kirby, P.; Solomon, G.S.; Cox, N.J.; Zuckerman, S.L.","Post-concussion syndrome (PCS) is characterized by persistent cognitive, somatic, and emotional symptoms after a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Genetic and other biological variables may contribute to PCS etiology, and the emergence of biobanks linked to electronic health records (EHRs) offers new opportunities for research on PCS. We sought to validate the EHR data of PCS patients by comparing two diagnostic algorithms deployed in the Vanderbilt University Medical Center de-identified database of 2.8 million patient EHRs. The algorithms identified individuals with PCS by: 1) natural language processing (NLP) of narrative text in the EHR combined with structured demographic, diagnostic, and encounter data; or 2) coded billing and procedure data. The predictive value of each algorithm was assessed, and cases and controls identified by each approach were compared on demographic and medical characteristics. The NLP algorithm identified 507 cases and 10,857 controls. The negative predictive value in controls was 78% and the positive predictive value (PPV) in cases was 82%. Conversely, the coded algorithm identified 1142 patients with two or more PCS billing codes and had a PPV of 76%. Comparisons of PCS controls to both case groups recovered known epidemiology of PCS: Cases were more likely than controls to be female and to have pre-morbid diagnoses of anxiety, migraine, and post-traumatic stress disorder. In contrast, controls and cases were equally likely to have attention deficit hyperactive disorder and learning disabilities, in accordance with the findings of recent systematic reviews of PCS risk factors.

We developed a comprehensive manually annotated EHR reference standard and assessed NLP performance at both document and patient level on data from 200 patients (~5000 documents). We achieved promising results (>80% f1 score at both document and patient level). Simple NLP approaches can be successfully used to identify patients who exhibit suicidal risk behaviour, and our proposed approach could be useful for other populations and settings. © 2019 International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) and IOS Press.",2019,,Studies in Health Technology and Informatics,264,,413-417,,10.3233/SHTI190254,,#2623,Velupillai 2019,"",""
Assessment of gender-based linguistic differences in physician trainee evaluations of medical faculty using automated text mining,"Heath, J.K.; Weissman, G.E.; Clancy, C.B.; Shou, H.; Farrar, J.T.; Dine, C.J.","IMPORTANCE Women are underrepresented at higher ranks in academic medicine. However, the factors contributing to this disparity have not been fully elucidated. Implicit bias and unconscious mental attitudes toward a person or group may be factors. Although academic medical centers use physician trainee evaluations of faculty to inform promotion decisions, little is known about gender bias in these evaluations. To date, no studies have examined narrative evaluations of medical faculty by physician trainees for differences based on gender. OBJECTIVE To characterize gender-associated linguistic differences in narrative evaluations of medical faculty written by physician trainees. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort study included all faculty teaching evaluations completed for the department of medicine faculty by medical students, residents, and fellows at a large academic center in Pennsylvania from July 1, 2015, through June 30, 2016. Data analysis was performed from June 1, 2018, through July 31, 2018. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Word use in faculty evaluations was quantified using automated text mining by converting free-text comments into unique 1- and 2-word phrases. Mixedeffects logistic regression analysis was performed to assess associations of faculty gender with frequencies of specific words and phrases present in a physician trainee evaluation. RESULTS A total of 7326 unique evaluations were collected for 521 faculty (325 men [62.4%] and 196 women [37.6%]). The individual words art (odds ratio [OR], 7.78; 95%CI, 1.01-59.89), trials (OR, 4.43; 95%CI, 1.34-14.69), master (OR, 4.24; 95%CI, 1.69-10.63), and humor (OR, 2.32; 95%CI, 1.44-3.73) were significantly associated with evaluations of male faculty, whereas the words empathetic (OR, 4.34; 95%CI, 1.56-12.07), delight (OR, 4.26; 95%CI, 1.35-13.40), and warm (OR, 3.45; 95%CI, 1.83-6.49) were significantly associated with evaluations of female faculty. Two-word phrases associated with male faculty evaluations included run rounds (OR, 7.78; 95%CI, 1.01-59.84), big picture (OR, 7.15; 95%CI, 1.68-30.42), and master clinician (OR, 4.02; 95%CI, 1.21-13.36), whereas evaluations of female faculty were more likely to be associated with model physician (OR, 7.75; 95% CI, 1.70-35.39), just right (OR, 6.97; 95%CI, 1.51-32.30), and attention (to) detail (OR, 4.26; 95%CI, 1.36-13.40). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The data showed quantifiable linguistic differences between free-text comments about male and female faculty in physician trainee evaluations. Further evaluation of these differences, particularly in association with ongoing gender disparities in faculty promotion and retention, may be warranted. © 2019 JAMA Network Open.All right reserved.",2019,,JAMA Network Open,2,5,,,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.3520,,#2630,Heath 2019,"",""

Investigate transitions into drug addiction through text mining of reddit data,"Lu, J.; Sridhar, S.; Pandey, R.; Hasan, M.A.; Mohler, G.","Increasing rates of opioid drug abuse and heightened prevalence of online support communities underscore the necessity of employing data mining techniques to better understand drug addiction using these rapidly developing online resources. In this work, we obtained data from Reddit, an online collection of forums, to gather insight into drug use/misuse using text snippets from users narratives. Specifically, using users' posts, we trained a binary classifier which predicts a user's transitions from casual drug discussion forums to drug recovery forums. We also proposed a Cox regression model that outputs likelihoods of such transitions. In doing so, we found that utterances of select drugs and certain linguistic features contained in one's posts can help predict these transitions. Using unfiltered drug-related posts, our research delineates drugs that are associated with higher rates of transitions from recreational drug discussion to support/recovery discussion, offers insight into modern drug culture, and provides tools with potential applications in combating the opioid crisis. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Moonstone: A novel natural language processing system for inferring social risk from clinical narratives,"Conway, M.; Keyhani, S.; Christensen, L.; South, B.R.; Vali, M.; Walter, L.C.; Mowery, D.L.; Abdelrahman, S.; Chapman, W.W.","Background: Social risk factors are important dimensions of health and are linked to access to care, quality of life, health outcomes and life expectancy. However, in the Electronic Health Record, data related to many social risk factors are primarily recorded in free-text clinical notes, rather than as more readily computable structured data, and hence cannot currently be easily incorporated into automated assessments of health. In this paper, we present Moonstone, a new, highly configurable rule-based clinical natural language processing system designed to automatically extract information that requires inferencing from clinical notes. Our initial use case for the tool is focused on the automatic extraction of social risk factor information - in this case, housing situation, living alone, and social support - from clinical notes. Nursing notes, social work notes, emergency room physician notes, primary care notes, hospital admission notes, and discharge summaries, all derived from the Veterans Health Administration, were used for algorithm development and evaluation. Results: An evaluation of Moonstone demonstrated that the system is highly accurate in extracting and classifying the three variables of interest (housing situation, living alone, and social support). The system achieved positive predictive value (i.e. precision) scores ranging from 0.66 (homeless/marginally housed) to 0.98 (lives at home/not homeless), accuracy scores ranging from 0.63 (lives in facility) to 0.95 (lives alone), and sensitivity (i.e. recall) scores ranging from 0.75 (lives in facility) to 0.97 (lives alone). Conclusions: The Moonstone system is - to the best of our knowledge - the first freely available, open source natural language processing system designed to extract social risk factors from clinical text with good (lives in facility) to excellent (lives alone) performance. Although developed with the social risk factor identification task in mind, Moonstone provides a powerful tool to address a range of clinical natural language processing tasks, especially those tasks that require nuanced linguistic processing in conjunction with inference capabilities. © 2019 The Author(s).",2019,,Journal of Biomedical Semantics,10,1,,,10.1186/s13326-019-0198-0,,#2643,Conway 2019,"",""
Identification of suicidal behavior among psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents using natural language processing and machine learning of electronic health records,"Carson, N.J.; Mullin, B.; Sanchez, M.J.; Lu, F.; Yang, K.; Menezes, M.; Cook, B.L.","Objective The rapid proliferation of machine learning research using electronic health records to classify healthcare outcomes offers an opportunity to address the pressing public health problem of adolescent suicidal behavior. We describe the development and evaluation of a machine learning algorithm using natural language processing of electronic health records to identify suicidal behavior among psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents. Methods Adolescents hospitalized on a psychiatric inpatient unit in a community health system in the northeastern United States were surveyed for history of suicide attempt in the past 12 months. A total of 73 respondents had electronic health records available prior to the index psychiatric admission. Unstructured clinical notes were downloaded from the year preceding the index inpatient admission. Natural language processing identified phrases from the notes associated with the suicide attempt outcome. We enriched this group of phrases with a clinically focused list of terms representing known risk and protective factors for suicide attempt in adolescents. We then applied the random forest machine learning algorithm to develop a classification model. The model performance was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy. Results The final model had a sensitivity of 0.83, specificity of 0.22, AUC of 0.68, a PPV of 0.42, NPV of 0.67, and an accuracy of 0.47. The terms mostly highly associated with suicide attempt clustered around terms related to suicide, family members, psychiatric disorders, and psychotropic medications.

Managing functional neurological disorders: Protocol of a cohort study on psychogenic non-epileptic seizures study,"Altalib, H.H.; Galluzzo, D.; Argraves, S.; Goulet, J.; Bornovski, Y.; Cheung, K.-H.; Jackson-Shaheed, E.; Tolchin, B.; Fenton, B.T.; Pugh, M.J.","Background: Functional neurological disorders (FNDs) are neurological symptoms that cannot be explained by an underlying neurological lesion or other medical illness and that do not have clear neuropathological correlates. Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) are a common and highly disabling form of FND, characterized by paroxysmal episodes of involuntary movements and altered consciousness that can appear clinically similar to epileptic seizures. PNES are unique among FNDs in that they are diagnosed by video electroencephalo-graphic (VEEG), a well-established biomarker for the disorder. The course of illness and response to treatment of PNES remain controversial. This study aims to describe the epidemiology of PNES in the Department of Veterans Affairs Healthcare System (VA), evaluate outcomes of veterans offered different treatments, and compare models of care for PNES. Methods: This electronic health record (EHR) cohort study utilizes an informatics search tool and a natural language processing algorithm to identify cases of PNES nationally. We will use VA inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, and chart abstraction data across all 170 medical centers to identify cases in fiscal years 2002–2018. Outcome measurements such as seizure frequency, emergency room visits, hospital admissions, suicide-related behavior, and the utilization of psychotherapy prior to and after PNES diagnosis will be used to assess the effectiveness of models of care. Discussion: This study will describe the risk factors and course of treatment of a large cohort of people with PNES. Since PNES are cared for by a variety of different modalities, treatment orientations, and models of care, effectiveness outcomes such as seizure outcomes and utilization of emergency visits for seizures will be assessed. Outcome measurements such as seizure frequency, emergency room visits, hospital admissions, suicide-related behavior, and psychotherapy prior to and after PNES diagnosis will be used to assess the effectiveness of models of care. © 2019 Altalib et al.",2019,,Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment,15,,3557-3568,,10.2147/NDT.S234852,,#2653,Altalib 2019,"",""
Recorded poor insight as a predictor of service use outcomes: Cohort study of patients with first-episode psychosis in a large mental healthcare database,"Ramu, N.; Kolliakou, A.; Sanyal, J.; Patel, R.; Stewart, R.","Objectives To investigate recorded poor insight in relation to mental health and service use outcomes in a cohort with first-episode psychosis. Design We developed a natural language processing algorithm to ascertain statements of poor or diminished insight and tested this in a cohort of patients with first-episode psychosis. Setting The clinical record text at the South London and Maudsley National Health Service Trust in the UK was used. Participants We applied the algorithm to characterise a cohort of 2026 patients with first-episode psychosis attending an early intervention service. Primary and secondary outcome measures Recorded poor insight within 1 month of registration was investigated in relation to (1) incidence of psychiatric hospitalisation, (2) odds of legally enforced hospitalisation, (3) number of days spent as a mental health inpatient and (4) number of different antipsychotic agents prescribed; outcomes were measured over varying follow-up periods from 12 months to 60 months, adjusting for a range of sociodemographic and clinical covariates. Results Recorded poor insight, present in 48.9% of the sample, was positively associated with youngest and oldest age groups, unemployment and schizophrenia (compared with bipolar disorder) and was negatively associated with Asian ethnicity, married status, home ownership and recorded cannabis use. It was significantly associated with higher levels of all four outcomes over the succeeding 12 months. Associations with hospitalisation incidence and number of antipsychotics remained independently significant when measured over 60 and 48 months, respectively. Conclusions Recorded poor insight in people with recent onset psychosis predicted higher subsequent inpatient mental healthcare use.

Predicting inadequate postoperative pain management in depressed patients: A machine learning approach,"Parthipan, A.; Banerjee, I.; Humphreys, K.; Asch, S.M.; Curtin, C.; Carroll, I.; Hernandez-Boussard, T.","Widely-prescribed prodrug opioids (e.g., hydrocodone) require conversion by liver enzyme CYP-2D6 to exert their analgesic effects. The most commonly prescribed antidepressant, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), inhibits CYP-2D6 activity and therefore may reduce the effectiveness of prodrug opioids. We used a machine learning approach to identify patients prescribed a combination of SSRIs and prodrug opioids postoperatively and to examine the effect of this combination on postoperative pain control. Using EHR data from an academic medical center, we identified patients receiving surgery over a 9-year period. We developed and validated natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to extract depression-related information (diagnosis, SSRI use, symptoms) from structured and unstructured data elements. The primary outcome was the difference between preoperative pain score and postoperative pain at discharge, 3-week and 8-week time points. We developed computational models to predict the increase or decrease in the postoperative pain across the 3 time points by using the patient’s EHR data (e.g. medications, vitals, demographics) captured before surgery. We evaluate the generalizability of the model using 10-fold cross-validation method where the holdout test method is repeated 10 times and mean area-under-the-curve (AUC) is considered as evaluation metrics for the prediction performance. We identified 4,306 surgical patients with symptoms of depression. A total of 14.1% were prescribed both an SSRI and a prodrug opioid, 29.4% were prescribed an SSRI and a non-prodrug opioid, 18.6% were prescribed a prodrug opioid but were not on SSRIs, and 37.5% were prescribed a non-prodrug opioid but were not on SSRIs. Our NLP algorithm identified depression with a F1 score of 0.95 against manual annotation of 300 randomly sampled clinical notes. On average, patients receiving prodrug opioids had lower average pain scores (p<0.05), with the exception of the SSRI+ group at 3-weeks postoperative follow-up. However, SSRI+/Prodrug+ had significantly worse pain control at discharge, 3 and 8-week follow-up (p < .01) compared to SSRI+/Prodrug- patients, whereas there was no difference in pain control among the SSRI- patients by prodrug opioid (p>0.05). The machine learning algorithm accurately predicted the increase or decrease of the discharge, 3-week and 8-week follow-up pain scores when compared to the pre-operative pain score using 10-fold cross validation (mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.87, 0.81, and 0.69, respectively). Preoperative pain, surgery type, and opioid tolerance were the strongest predictors of postoperative pain control. We provide the first direct clinical evidence that the known ability of SSRIs to inhibit prodrug opioid effectiveness is associated with worse pain control among depressed patients. Current prescribing patterns indicate that prescribers may not account for this interaction when choosing an opioid. The study results imply that prescribers might instead choose direct acting opioids (e.g. oxycodone or morphine) in depressed patients on SSRIs. © 2019 Parthipan et al.

"Semantic measures: Using natural language processing to measure, differentiate, and describe psychological constructs","Kjell, O.N.E.; Kjell, K.; Garcia, D.; Sikström, S.","Psychological constructs, such as emotions, thoughts, and attitudes are often measured by asking individuals to reply to questions using closed-ended numerical rating scales. However, when asking people about their state of mind in a natural context (""How are you?""), we receive open-ended answers using words (""Fine and happy!"") and not closed-ended answers using numbers (""7"") or categories (""A lot""). Nevertheless, to date it has been difficult to objectively quantify responses to open-ended questions. We develop an approach using open-ended questions in which the responses are analyzed using natural language processing (Latent Semantic Analyses). This approach of using open-ended, semantic questions is compared with traditional rating scales in nine studies (N = 92-854), including two different study paradigms. The first paradigm requires participants to describe psychological aspects of external stimuli (facial expressions) and the second paradigm involves asking participants to report their subjective well-being and mental health problems. The results demonstrate that the approach using semantic questions yields good statistical properties with competitive, or higher, validity and reliability compared with corresponding numerical rating scales. As these semantic measures are based on natural language and measure, differentiate, and describe psychological constructs, they have the potential of complementing and extending traditional rating scales. © 2018 American Psychological Association.",2019,,Psychological Methods,24,1,92-115,,10.1037/met0000191,,#2662,Kjell 2019,"",""
A clinical text classification paradigm using weak supervision and deep representation 08 Information and Computing Sciences 0801 Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing 17 Psychology and Cognitive Sciences 1702 Cognitive Sciences,"Wang, Y.; Sohn, S.; Liu, S.; Shen, F.; Wang, L.; Atkinson, E.J.; Amin, S.; Liu, H.","Background: Automatic clinical text classification is a natural language processing (NLP) technology that unlocks information embedded in clinical narratives. Machine learning approaches have been shown to be effective for clinical text classification tasks. However, a successful machine learning model usually requires extensive human efforts to create labeled training data and conduct feature engineering. In this study, we propose a clinical text classification paradigm using weak supervision and deep representation to reduce these human efforts. Methods: We develop a rule-based NLP algorithm to automatically generate labels for the training data, and then use the pre-trained word embeddings as deep representation features for training machine learning models. Since machine learning is trained on labels generated by the automatic NLP algorithm, this training process is called weak supervision. We evaluat the paradigm effectiveness on two institutional case studies at Mayo Clinic: smoking status classification and proximal femur (hip) fracture classification, and one case study using a public dataset: the i2b2 2006 smoking status classification shared task. We test four widely used machine learning models, namely, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks (MLPNN), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), using this paradigm. Precision, recall, and F1 score are used as metrics to evaluate performance. Results: CNN achieves the best performance in both institutional tasks (F1 score: 0.92 for Mayo Clinic smoking status classification and 0.97 for fracture classification). We show that word embeddings significantly outperform tf-idf and topic modeling features in the paradigm, and that CNN captures additional patterns from the weak supervision compared to the rule-based NLP algorithms. We also observe two drawbacks of the proposed paradigm that CNN is more sensitive to the size of training data, and that the proposed paradigm might not be effective for complex multiclass classification tasks. Conclusion: The proposed clinical text classification paradigm could reduce human efforts of labeled training data creation and feature engineering for applying machine learning to clinical text classification by leveraging weak supervision and deep representation. The experimental experiments have validated the effectiveness of paradigm by two institutional and one shared clinical text classification tasks. © 2019 The Author(s).",2019,,BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making,19,1,,,10.1186/s12911-018-0723-6,,#2667,Wang 2019,"",""

Methods: Primary data were derived from Kaiser Permanente Northwest (2008–2014), an integrated health care system (~n > 475 000 unique individuals per year). Data included International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes for nonfatal diagnoses, International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes for fatal events, clinical notes, and prescription medication records. We assessed sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for algorithms relative to medical chart review and conducted assessments of algorithm portability in Kaiser Permanente Washington, Tennessee State Medicaid, and Optum. Results: Code-based algorithm performance was excellent for opioid-related overdoses (sensitivity = 97.2%, specificity = 84.6%) and classification of heroin-involved overdoses (sensitivity = 91.8%, specificity = 99.0%). Performance was acceptable for code-based suicide/suicide attempt classifications (sensitivity = 70.7%, specificity = 90.5%); sensitivity improved with NLP (sensitivity = 78.7%, specificity = 91.0%). Performance was acceptable for the code-based substance abuse-involved classification (sensitivity = 75.3%, specificity = 79.5%); sensitivity improved with the NLP-enhanced algorithm (sensitivity = 80.5%, specificity = 76.3%). The opioid-related overdose algorithm performed well across portability assessment sites, with sensitivity greater than 96% and specificity greater than 84%. Cross-site sensitivity for heroin-involved overdose was greater than 87%, specificity greater than or equal to 99%. Conclusions: Code-based algorithms developed to detect opioid-related overdoses and classify them according to heroin involvement perform well. Algorithms for classifying suicides/attempts and abuse-related opioid overdoses perform adequately for use for research, particularly given the complexity of classifying such overdoses. The NLP-enhanced algorithms for suicides/suicide attempts and abuse-related overdoses perform significantly better than code-based algorithms and are appropriate for use in settings that have data and capacity to use NLP. © 2019 The Authors.

Social contextual data are rarely captured prospectively in a structured and comprehensive manner, leaving large knowledge gaps. Extraction methods are now being developed to facilitate the collection, standardization, and integration of SDOH data into electronic health records.

A cognitive modeling approach on ironical phraseology in Twitter,"Martín Gascón, B.","The development and growth of social networks evidence human creativity via the use of figurative language including irony. Recent studies on modeling irony and irony detection in social media have looked at it from a traditional perspective and have focused primarily on developing natural language processing systems, thus ignoring the mental processes the participants experience during ironic speech acts. As a result, irony has been misinterpreted and mixed by the experimental literature with other disparate phenomena, such as jokes, understatements or banter. On the other hand, scholars from the field of Cognitive Linguistics have studied the cognitive processes operating in the creation of ironic remarks. With regard to this, Ruiz de Mendoza’s [9] development of the echoic account focuses on ironic discourse and categorizes verbal irony. Yet, no study to date has explored ironical phraseology in terms of cognitive modeling based on bigdata. This study, therefore, aims to examine how Spanish-speakers conceptualize and express irony in Twitter. Results revealed that irony was frequently misconceived and, as a consequence, additional cues such as explicit ironic hashtags prevented readers from interpreting the message literally, especially in explicit-echoic ironic cases. A more frequent interaction between text-hashtag as compared to text-emoji was also evinced for all potentially ironic linguistic signs. It is expected that our findings contribute to research on Spanish as a foreign language (ELE in the native-language acronym) teaching by enhancing the intercultural sensitivity in the learner, as well as to the field of computational linguistics in adding feature types. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",2019,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),11755 LNAI,,299-314,,10.1007/978-3-030-30135-4_22,,#2671,MartínGascón 2019,"",""
Association between child psychiatric emergency room outcomes and dimensions of psychopathology,"McCoy, T.H.; Wiste, A.K.; Doyle, A.E.; Pellegrini, A.M.; Perlis, R.H.","Objective: To determine the degree to which dimensional psychopathology predicts length of stay in an emergency department (ED)and need for hospital admission among children with psychiatric complaints. Method: Electronic health records of children age 4–17 years who presented to the ED of a large academic medical center were analyzed using a natural language processing tool to estimate Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)symptom scores. These scores' association with length of stay and probability of admission versus discharge to home were evaluated. Results: We identified 3061 children and adolescents who presented to the ED and were evaluated by the psychiatry service between November 2008 and March 2015. Median length of stay was 7.8 h (interquartile range 5.2–14.3 h)and 1696 (55.4%)were admitted to the hospital. Higher estimated RDoC arousal, cognitive, positive, and social domain scores were associated with increased length of stay in multiple regression models, adjusted for age, sex, race, private insurance, voluntary admission, and diagnostic categories. In similarly adjusted models, odds of hospital admission were increased by higher RDoC arousal and cognitive domain scores and decreased by higher negative domain scores. Conclusions: A natural language processing tool to characterize dimensional psychopathology identified features associated with differential outcomes in children in the psychiatric ED, most notably symptoms reflecting arousal and cognitive function.

Automated analysis of domestic violence police reports to explore abuse types and victim injuries: Text mining study,"Karystianis, G.; Adily, A.; Schofield, P.W.; Greenberg, D.; Jorm, L.; Nenadic, G.; Butler, T.","Background: The police attend numerous domestic violence events each year, recording details of these events as both structured (coded) data and unstructured free-text narratives. Abuse types (including physical, psychological, emotional, and financial) conducted by persons of interest (POIs) along with any injuries sustained by victims are typically recorded in long descriptive narratives. Objective: We aimed to determine if an automated text mining method could identify abuse types and any injuries sustained by domestic violence victims in narratives contained in a large police dataset from the New South Wales Police Force. Methods: We used a training set of 200 recorded domestic violence events to design a knowledge-driven approach based on syntactical patterns in the text and then applied this approach to a large set of police reports. Results: Testing our approach on an evaluation set of 100 domestic violence events provided precision values of 90.2% and 85.0% for abuse type and victim injuries, respectively. In a set of 492,393 domestic violence reports, we found 71.32% (351,178) of events with mentions of the abuse type(s) and more than one-third (177,117 events; 35.97%) contained victim injuries. ""Emotional/verbal abuse"" (33.46%; 117,488) was the most common abuse type, followed by ""punching"" (86,322 events; 24.58%) and ""property damage"" (22.27%; 78,203 events). ""Bruising"" was the most common form of injury sustained (51,455 events; 29.03%), with ""cut/abrasion"" (28.93%; 51,284 events) and ""red marks/signs"" (23.71%; 42,038 events) ranking second and third, respectively. Conclusions: The results suggest that text mining can automatically extract information from police-recorded domestic violence events that can support further public health research into domestic violence, such as examining the relationship of abuse types with victim injuries and of gender and abuse types with risk escalation for victims of domestic violence. Potential also exists for this extracted information to be linked to information on the mental health status. © George Karystianis, Armita Adily, Peter W Schofield, David Greenberg, Louisa Jorm, Goran Nenadic, Tony Butler.",2019,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,21,3,,,10.2196/13067,,#2673,Karystianis 2019,"",""
Automated detection of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy risk factors in electronic medical records using natural language processing,"Barbour, K.; Hesdorffer, D.C.; Tian, N.; Yozawitz, E.G.; McGoldrick, P.E.; Wolf, S.; McDonough, T.L.; Nelson, A.; Loddenkemper, T.; Basma, N.; Johnson, S.B.; Grinspan, Z.M.","Objective: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is an important cause of mortality in epilepsy. However, there is a gap in how often providers counsel patients about SUDEP. One potential solution is to electronically prompt clinicians to provide counseling via automated detection of risk factors in electronic medical records (EMRs). We evaluated (1) the feasibility and generalizability of using regular expressions to identify risk factors in EMRs and (2) barriers to generalizability. Methods: Data included physician notes for 3000 patients from one medical center (home) and 1000 from five additional centers (away). Through chart review, we identified three SUDEP risk factors: (1) generalized tonic–clonic seizures, (2) refractory epilepsy, and (3) epilepsy surgery candidacy. Regular expressions of risk factors were manually created with home training data, and performance was evaluated with home test and away test data. Performance was evaluated by sensitivity, positive predictive value, and F-measure. Generalizability was defined as an absolute decrease in performance by <0.10 for away versus home test data. To evaluate underlying barriers to generalizability, we identified causes of errors seen more often in away data than home data. To demonstrate how small revisions can improve generalizability, we removed three “boilerplate” standard text phrases from away notes and repeated performance. Results: We observed high performance in home test data (F-measure range = 0.86-0.90), and low to high performance in away test data (F-measure range = 0.53-0.81). After removing three boilerplate phrases, away performance improved (F-measure range = 0.79-0.89) and generalizability was achieved for nearly all measures. The only significant barrier to generalizability was use of boilerplate phrases, causing 104 of 171 errors (61%) in away data. Significance: Regular expressions are a feasible and probably a generalizable method to identify variables related to SUDEP risk. Our methods may be implemented to create large patient cohorts for research and to generate electronic prompts for SUDEP counseling.

Using natural language processing of clinical text to enhance identification of opioid-related overdoses in electronic health records data,"Hazlehurst, B.; Green, C.A.; Perrin, N.A.; Brandes, J.; Carrell, D.S.; Baer, A.; DeVeaugh-Geiss, A.; Coplan, P.M.","Purpose: To enhance automated methods for accurately identifying opioid-related overdoses and classifying types of overdose using electronic health record (EHR) databases. Methods: We developed a natural language processing (NLP) software application to code clinical text documentation of overdose, including identification of intention for self-harm, substances involved, substance abuse, and error in medication usage. Using datasets balanced with cases of suspected overdose and records of individuals at elevated risk for overdose, we developed and validated the application using Kaiser Permanente Northwest data, then tested portability of the application using Kaiser Permanente Washington data. Datasets were chart-reviewed to provide a gold standard for comparison and evaluation of the automated method. Results: The method performed well in identifying overdose (sensitivity = 0.80, specificity = 0.93), intentional overdose (sensitivity = 0.81, specificity = 0.98), and involvement of opioids (excluding heroin, sensitivity = 0.72, specificity = 0.96) and heroin (sensitivity = 0.84, specificity = 1.0). The method performed poorly at identifying adverse drug reactions and overdose due to patient error and fairly at identifying substance abuse in opioid-related unintentional overdose (sensitivity = 0.67, specificity = 0.96). Evaluation using validation datasets yielded significant reductions, in specificity and negative predictive values only, for many classifications mentioned above. However, these measures remained above 0.80, thus, performance observed during development was largely maintained during validation. Similar results were obtained when evaluating portability, although there was a significant reduction in sensitivity for unintentional overdose that was attributed to missing text clinical notes in the database. Conclusions: Methods that process text clinical notes show promise for improving accuracy and fidelity at identifying and classifying overdoses according to type using EHR data. © 2019 The Authors Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd",2019,,Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety,28,8,1143-1151,,10.1002/pds.4810,,#2679,Hazlehurst 2019,"",""

For patients' decision-making, detecting CRCI is important. To do so, this study uses language-based CRCI screening to examine participants' language ability. [Objective] This study was conducted to ascertain whether a Natural Language Processing (NLP) based system can detect CRCI, or not. [Materials and Methods] We obtained materials of two types from cancer patients (n=116): (1) speech samples on three topics, and (2) cognitive function level test scores from Hasegawa's Dementia Scale - Revised (HDS-R), a test used in Japan for dementia patients. The test is similar to the Mini-Mental State Examination. [Results and Discussion] Cancer patients with lower HDS-R scores showed a significantly lower Type Token Ratio (TTR).

Research Domain Criteria scores estimated through natural language processing are associated with risk for suicide and accidental death,"McCoy, T.H.; Pellegrini, A.M.; Perlis, R.H.","Background: Identification of individuals at increased risk for suicide is an important public health priority, but the extent to which considering clinical phenomenology improves prediction of longer term outcomes remains understudied. Hospital discharge provides an opportunity to stratify risk using readily available clinical records and details. Methods: We applied a validated natural language processing tool to generate estimated Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) scores for a cohort of 444,317 individuals drawn from 815,457 hospital discharges between 2005 and 2013. We used survival analysis to examine the association of this risk with suicide and accidental death, adjusted for sociodemographic features. Results: In adjusted models, symptoms in each of the five domains contributed to incremental risk (log rank P < 0.001), with greatest increase observed with positive valence. The contribution of each domain to risk was time dependent. Conclusions: RDoC symptom scores parsed from clinical documentation are associated with suicide and illustrates that multiple domains contribute to risk in a time-varying fashion. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2019,,Depression and Anxiety,36,5,392-399,,10.1002/da.22882,,#2685,McCoy 2019,"",""
Natural language processing and machine learning to identify alcohol misuse from the electronic health record in trauma patients: development and internal validation,"Afshar, M.; Phillips, A.; Karnik, N.; Mueller, J.; To, D.; Gonzalez, R.; Price, R.; Cooper, R.; Joyce, C.; Dligach, D.","Objective: Alcohol misuse is present in over a quarter of trauma patients. Information in the clinical notes of the electronic health record of trauma patients may be used for phenotyping tasks with natural language processing (NLP) and supervised machine learning. The objective of this study is to train and validate an NLP classifier for identifying patients with alcohol misuse. Materials and Methods: An observational cohort of 1422 adult patients admitted to a trauma center between April 2013 and November 2016. Linguistic processing of clinical notes was performed using the clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System. The primary analysis was the binary classification of alcohol misuse. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test served as the reference standard. Results: The data corpus comprised 91 045 electronic health record notes and 16 091 features. In the final machine learning classifier, 16 features were selected from the first 24 hours of notes for identifying alcohol misuse. The classifier's performance in the validation cohort had an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 0.85). Sensitivity and specificity were at 56.0% (95% CI, 44.1% to 68.0%) and 88.9% (95% CI, 84.4% to 92.8%). The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test demonstrates the classifier fits the data well (P.17). A simpler rule-based keyword approach had a decrease in sensitivity when compared with the NLP classifier from 56.0% to 18.2%.

"Suicide Among Older Adults Living in or Transitioning to Residential Long-term Care, 2003 to 2015","Mezuk, B.; Ko, T.M.; Kalesnikava, V.A.; Jurgens, D.","Importance: Almost 25% of Medicare beneficiaries live in residential long-term care (LTC) (eg, independent or assisted living facility or nursing home). There are few reliable statistics on completed suicide in LTC, in part because of data limitations. Objectives: To estimate the number of suicides associated with residential LTC (ie, among persons in a facility, transitioning into or out of a facility, or otherwise associated with LTC) among adults 55 and older and, secondarily, to identify whether machine learning tools could improve the quality of suicide surveillance data. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional epidemiologic study (conducted in 2018) of restricted-access data from the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) (2003-2015) using restricted-access case narratives from suicides and undetermined deaths among adults 55 years and older in 27 states. Participants were all suicides and undetermined deaths (N = 47 759) among persons 55 years and older. Exposure: Long-term care cited in the coroner/medical examiner case narrative, whether as a reason for self-harm or the injury location, identified using machine learning natural language processing (NLP) algorithms plus manual review of texts. Main Outcomes and Measures: Number and characteristics (eg, demographics, health history, and means of injury) of suicides associated with LTC. The κ statistic was used to estimate the reliability of the existing NVDRS injury location codes relative to cases identified by the algorithm. Results: Among 47 759 persons 55 years and older (median age, 64 years; 77.6% male; 90.0% non-Hispanic white), this study identified 1037 suicide deaths associated with LTC, including 428 among older adults living in LTC, 449 among older adults transitioning to LTC, and 160 otherwise associated with LTC. In contrast, there were only 263 cases coded with the existing NVDRS location code ""supervised residential facility,"" which had poor agreement with cases that the algorithm identified as occurring in LTC (κ statistic, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.26-0.35). Conclusions and Relevance: Over a 13-year period, approximately 2.2% of suicides among adults 55 years and older were associated with LTC in some manner. Clinicians, administrators, and policy makers should consider ways to promote the mental health and well-being of older adults experiencing functioning limitations and their families.

Profiling commenters on mental health-related online forums: A methodological example focusing on eating disorder-related commenters,"McCaig, D.; Elliott, M.T.; Siew, C.S.Q.; Walasek, L.; Meyer, C.","Background: Understanding the characteristics of commenters on mental health-related online forums is vital for the development of effective psychological interventions in these communities. The way in which commenters interact can enhance our understanding of their characteristics. Objective: Using eating disorder-related (EDR) forums as an example, this study detailed a methodology that aimed to determine subtypes of mental health-related forums and profile their commenters based on the other forums to which they contributed. Methods: The researchers identified all public EDR forums (with =500 contributing commenters between March 2017 and February 2018) on a large Web-based discussion platform (Reddit). A mixed-methods approach comprising network analysis with community detection, text mining, and manual review identified subtypes of EDR forums. For each subtype, another network analysis with community detection was conducted using the EDR forum commenter overlap between 50 forums on which the commenters also commented. The topics of forums in each detected community were then manually reviewed to identify the shared interests of each subtype of EDR forum commenters. Results: Six subtypes of EDR forums were identified, to which 14,024 commenters had contributed. The results focus on 2 subtypes-proeating disorder and thinspiration-and communities of commenters within both subtypes. Within the proeating disorder subtype, 3 communities of commenters were detected that related to the body and eating, mental health, and women, appearance, and mixed topics. With regard to the thinspiration group, 78.17% (849/1086) of commenters had also commented on pornographic forums and 16.66% (181/1086) had contributed to proeating disorder forums. Conclusions: The article exemplifies a methodology that provides insight into subtypes of mental health-related forums and the characteristics of their commenters.

Negative Symptoms in Early-Onset Psychosis and Their Association With Antipsychotic Treatment Failure,"Downs, J.; Dean, H.; Lechler, S.; Sears, N.; Patel, R.; Shetty, H.; Hotopf, M.; Ford, T.; Kyriakopoulos, M.; Diaz-Caneja, C.M.; Arango, C.; MacCabe, J.H.; Hayes, R.D.; Pina-Camacho, L.","The prevalence of negative symptoms (NS) at first episode of early-onset psychosis (EOP), and their effect on psychosis prognosis is unclear. In a sample of 638 children with EOP (aged 10-17 y, 51% male), we assessed (1) the prevalence of NS at first presentation to mental health services and (2) whether NS predicted eventual development of multiple treatment failure (MTF) prior to the age of 18 (defined by initiation of a third trial of novel antipsychotic due to prior insufficient response, intolerable adverse-effects or non-adherence). Data were extracted from the electronic health records held by child inpatient and community-based services in South London, United Kingdom. Natural Language Processing tools were used to measure the presence of Marder Factor NS and antipsychotic use. The association between presenting with ?2 NS and the development of MTF over a 5-year period was modeled using Cox regression. Out of the 638 children, 37.5% showed ?2 NS at first presentation, and 124 (19.3%) developed MTF prior to the age of 18. The presence of NS at first episode was significantly associated with MTF (adjusted hazard ratio 1.62, 95% CI 1.07-2.46; P = .02) after controlling for a number of potential confounders including psychosis diagnostic classification, positive symptoms, comorbid depression, and family history of psychosis. Other factors associated with MTF included comorbid autism spectrum disorder, older age at first presentation, Black ethnicity, and family history of psychosis.

Text analysis of electronic medical records to predict seclusion in psychiatric wards: Proof of concept,"Hazewinkel, M.C.; De Winter, R.F.P.; Van Est, R.W.; Van Hyfte, D.; Wijnschenk, D.; Miedema, N.; Hoencamp, E.","Aim: With the introduction of “Electronic Medical Record” (EMR) a wealth of digital data has become available. This provides a unique opportunity for exploring precedents for seclusion. This study explored the feasibility of text mining analysis in the EMR to eventually help reduce the use of seclusion in psychiatry. Methods: The texts in notes and reports of the EMR during 5 years on an acute and non-acute psychiatric ward were analyzed using a text mining application. A period of 14 days was selected before seclusion or for non-secluded patients, before discharge. The resulting concepts were analyzed using chi-square tests to assess which concepts had a significant higher or lower frequency than expected in the “seclusion” and “non-seclusion” categories. Results: Text mining led to an overview of 1,500 meaningful concepts. In the 14 day period prior to the event, 115 of these concepts had a significantly higher frequency in the seclusion category and 49 in the non-seclusion category. Analysis of the concepts from days 14 to 7 resulted in 54 concepts with a significantly higher frequency in the seclusion-category and 14 in the non-seclusion category. Conclusions: The resulting significant concepts are comparable to reasons for seclusion in literature. These results are “proof of concept”. Analyzing text of reports in the EMR seems therefore promising as contribution to tools available for the prediction of seclusion. The next step is to build, train and test a model, before text mining can be part of an evidence-based clinical decision making tool. © 2019 Hazewinkel, de Winter, van Est, van Hyfte, Wijnschenk, Miedema and Hoencamp.

We applied this tool to a large corpus of psychiatric inpatient admission and discharge notes (2010–2015), and using the same cohort we examined face validity, predictive validity, and convergent validity with gold standard annotations. Results: In mixed-effect models adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical features, greater negative and positive symptom domains were associated with a shorter length of stay (β = −.88, p =.001 and β = −1.22, p <.001, respectively), while greater social and arousal domain scores were associated with a longer length of stay (β =.93, p <.001 and β =.81, p =.007, respectively). In fully adjusted Cox regression models, a greater positive domain score at discharge was also associated with a significant increase in readmission risk (hazard ratio = 1.22, p <.001). Positive and negative valence domains were correlated with expert annotation (by analysis of variance [df = 3], R2 =.13 and.19, respectively). Likewise, in a subset of patients, neurocognitive testing was correlated with cognitive performance scores (p <.008 for three of six measures). Conclusions: This shows that natural language processing can be used to efficiently and transparently score clinical notes in terms of cognitive and psychopathologic domains. © 2018 Society of Biological Psychiatry",2018,,Biological Psychiatry,83,12,997-1004,,10.1016/j.biopsych.2018.01.011,,#2737,McCoy 2018,"",""
Redditors in Recovery: Text Mining Reddit to Investigate Transitions into Drug Addiction,"","Increasing rates of opioid drug abuse and heightened prevalence of online support communities underscore the necessity of employing data mining techniques to better understand drug addiction using these rapidly developing online resources. In this work, we obtain data from Reddit, an online collection of forums, to gather insight into drug use/misuse using text data from users themselves. Specifically, using user posts, we trained 1) a binary classifier which predicts transitions from casual drug discussion forums to drug recovery forums and 2) a Cox regression model that outputs likelihoods of such transitions. In doing so, we found that utterances of select drugs and certain linguistic features contained in one's posts can help predict these transitions. Using unfiltered drug-related posts, our research delineates drugs that are associated with higher rates of transitions from recreational drug discussion to support/recovery discussion, offers insight into modern drug culture, and provides tools with potential applications in combating the opioid crisis. © 2018 IEEE.",2018,,"Proceedings - 2018 IEEE International Conference on Big Data, Big Data 2018",,,2521-2530,,10.1109/BigData.2018.8622552,,#2738,,"",""
Generating positive psychosis symptom keywords from electronic health records,"Viani, N.; Patel, R.; Stewart, R.; Velupillai, S.","The development of Natural Language Processing (NLP) solutions for information extraction from electronic health records (EHRs) has grown in recent years, as most clinically relevant information in EHRs is documented only in free text. One of the core tasks for any NLP system is to extract clinically relevant concepts such as symptoms. This information can then be used for more complex problems such as determining symptom onset, which requires temporal information. In the mental health domain, comprehensive vocabularies for specific disorders are scarce, and rarely contain keywords that reflect real-world terminology use. We explore the use of embedding techniques to automatically generate lexical variants of psychosis symptoms into vocabularies, that can be used in complex downstream NLP tasks. We study the impact of the underlying text material on generating useful lexical entries, experimenting with different corpora and with unigram/bigram models. We also propose a method to automatically compute thresholds for choosing the most relevant terms. Our main contribution is a systematic study of unsupervised vocabulary generation using different corpora for an understudied clinical use-case.

Multimodal sentiment analysis to explore the structure of emotions,"Hu, A.; Flaxman, S.","We propose a novel approach to multimodal sentiment analysis using deep neural networks combining visual analysis and natural language processing. Our goal is different than the standard sentiment analysis goal of predicting whether a sentence expresses positive or negative sentiment; instead, we aim to infer the latent emotional state of the user. Thus, we focus on predicting the emotion word tags attached by users to their Tumblr posts, treating these as “self-reported emotions.” We demonstrate that our multimodal model combining both text and image features outperforms separate models based solely on either images or text. Our model's results are interpretable, automatically yielding sensible word lists associated with emotions. We explore the structure of emotions implied by our model and compare it to what has been posited in the psychology literature, and validate our model on a set of images that have been used in psychology studies. Finally, our work also provides a useful tool for the growing academic study of images-both photographs and memes-on social networks. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Text mining and natural language processing on social media data giving insights for pharmacovigilance: A case study with fentanyl,"Paulose, R.; Gopal Samy, B.; Jegatheesan, K.","In the present investigation, the contribution of data mining and natural language processing in pharmacovigilance of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid pain medication was evaluated as a case study. The tweets containing fentanyl as keyword were retrieved from Twitter social media. The tweets were preprocessed in order to make them ready for the analysis. The sentiment analysis algorithm labeled 1927 tweets (41.85 %) as negative, 2067 tweets (44.9 %) as neutral and 610 (13.25 %) tweets as positive. Crisis, dead, death, die, dose, drug, heroin, kill, lethal, opioid, overdose and police were some of the words frequently associated with fentanyl. The high correlation and association of fentanyl with these terms identified by association rule algorithms demonstrated fentanyl abuse and aftermaths in the real world.

Improving short answer grading using transformer-based pre-training,"Sung, C.; Dhamecha, T.I.; Mukhi, N.","Dialogue-based tutoring platforms have shown great promise in helping individual students improve mastery. Short answer grading is a crucial component of such platforms. However, generative short answer grading using the same platform for diverse disciplines and titles is a crucial challenge due to data distribution variations across domains and a frequent occurrence of non-sentential answers. Recent NLP research has introduced novel deep learning architectures such as the Transformer, which merely uses self-attention mechanisms. Pre-trained models based on the Transformer architecture have been used to produce impressive results across a range of NLP tasks. In this work, we experiment with fine-tuning a pre-trained self-attention language model, namely Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) applying it to short answer grading, and show that it produces superior results across multiple domains. On the benchmarking dataset of SemEval-2013, we report upÂ to 10% absolute improvement in macro-average-F1 over state-of-the-art results. On our two psychology domain datasets, the fine-tuned model yields classification almost upÂ to the human-agreement levels.

Genetic validation of bipolar disorder identified by automated phenotyping using electronic health records,"Chen, C.-Y.; Lee, P.H.; Castro, V.M.; Minnier, J.; Charney, A.W.; Stahl, E.A.; Ruderfer, D.M.; Murphy, S.N.; Gainer, V.; Cai, T.; Jones, I.; Pato, C.N.; Pato, M.T.; Landén, M.; Sklar, P.; Perlis, R.H.; Smoller, J.W.","Bipolar disorder (BD) is a heritable mood disorder characterized by episodes of mania and depression. Although genomewide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified genetic loci contributing to BD risk, sample size has become a rate-limiting obstacle to genetic discovery. Electronic health records (EHRs) represent a vast but relatively untapped resource for high-throughput phenotyping. As part of the International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder (ICCBD), we previously validated automated EHR-based phenotyping algorithms for BD against in-person diagnostic interviews (Castro et al. Am J Psychiatry 172:363-372, 2015). Here, we establish the genetic validity of these phenotypes by determining their genetic correlation with traditionally ascertained samples. Case and control algorithms were derived from structured and narrative text in the Partners Healthcare system comprising more than 4.6 million patients over 20 years. Genomewide genotype data for 3330 BD cases and 3952 controls of European ancestry were used to estimate SNP-based heritability (h 2                             g) and genetic correlation (r g) between EHR-based phenotype definitions and traditionally ascertained BD cases in GWAS by the ICCBD and Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) using LD score regression. We evaluated BD cases identified using 4 EHR-based algorithms: an NLP-based algorithm (95-NLP) and three rule-based algorithms using codified EHR with decreasing levels of stringency-""coded-strict"", ""coded-broad"", and ""coded-broad based on a single clinical encounter"" (coded-broad-SV). The analytic sample comprised 862 95-NLP, 1968 coded-strict, 2581 coded-broad, 408 coded-broad-SV BD cases, and 3 952 controls. The estimated h 2                             g were 0.24 (p = 0.015), 0.09 (p = 0.064), 0.13 (p = 0.003), 0.00 (p = 0.591) for 95-NLP, coded-strict, coded-broad and coded-broad-SV BD, respectively. The h 2                             g for all EHR-based cases combined except coded-broad-SV (excluded due to 0 h 2                             g) was 0.12 (p = 0.004). These h 2                             g were lower or similar to the h 2                             g observed by the ICCBD + PGCBD (0.23, p = 3.17E-80, total N = 33,181). However, the r g between ICCBD + PGCBD and the EHR-based cases were high for 95-NLP (0.66, p = 3.69 × 10-5), coded-strict (1.00, p = 2.40 × 10-4), and coded-broad (0.74, p = 8.11 × 10-7). The r g between EHR-based BD definitions ranged from 0.90 to 0.98. These results provide the first genetic validation of automated EHR-based phenotyping for BD and suggest that this approach identifies cases that are highly genetically correlated with those ascertained through conventional methods.

"Leisure motivation and satisfaction: A text mining of yoga centres, yoga consumers, and their interactions","Jia, S.","Understanding the motivation and satisfaction of yoga consumers is of critical importance for both leisure service providers and leisure researchers to enhance the sustainability of personal lives in terms of physical wellness and mental happiness. For this purpose, this study investigated 25,120 pairs of online ratings and reviews from 100 yoga centres in Shanghai, China using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)-based text mining, and successfully established the relationship between rating and review. Findings suggest that Chinese yogis are motivated by improving physical condition, improving psychological condition, gracing appearance, establishing social connection, and creating social isolation. In addition to teaching mainstream yoga, yoga centres also provide additional courses. From a consumer perspective, yogis are relatively satisfied with teachers, courses, and the environment, but complain about the supporting staff, membership price, and reservation service. Managerially, yoga centres are encouraged to continue attending to the motivations of yogis, specialising their guidance, and fostering strengths and circumventing weaknesses in their service.

Identifying Suicide Ideation and Suicidal Attempts in a Psychiatric Clinical Research Database using Natural Language Processing,"Fernandes, A.C.; Dutta, R.; Velupillai, S.; Sanyal, J.; Stewart, R.; Chandran, D.","Research into suicide prevention has been hampered by methodological limitations such as low sample size and recall bias. Recently, Natural Language Processing (NLP) strategies have been used with Electronic Health Records to increase information extraction from free text notes as well as structured fields concerning suicidality and this allows access to much larger cohorts than previously possible. This paper presents two novel NLP approaches-a rule-based approach to classify the presence of suicide ideation and a hybrid machine learning and rule-based approach to identify suicide attempts in a psychiatric clinical database. Good performance of the two classifiers in the evaluation study suggest they can be used to accurately detect mentions of suicide ideation and attempt within free-text documents in this psychiatric database. The novelty of the two approaches lies in the malleability of each classifier if a need to refine performance, or meet alternate classification requirements arises. The algorithms can also be adapted to fit infrastructures of other clinical datasets given sufficient clinical recording practice knowledge, without dependency on medical codes or additional data extraction of known risk factors to predict suicidal behaviour. © 2018 The Author(s).",2018,,Scientific Reports,8,1,,,10.1038/s41598-018-25773-2,,#2759,Fernandes 2018,"",""
A text-mining analysis of the public's reactions to the opioid crisis,"Glowacki, E.M.; Glowacki, J.B.; Wilcox, G.B.","Background: Opioid abuse has become an epidemic in the United States. On August 25, 2016, the former Surgeon General of the United States sent an open letter to care providers asking for their help with combatting this growing health crisis. Social media forums like Twitter allow for open discussions among the public and up-to-date exchanges of information about timely topics like opioids. Therefore, the goal of the current study is to identify the public's reactions to the opioid epidemic by identifying the most popular topics tweeted by users. Methods: We used a text-miner, algorithmic-driven statistical program to capture 73,235 original tweets and retweets posted within a two-month time span (August 15, 2016 through October 15, 2016). All tweets contained references to “opioids,” “turnthetide,” or similar keywords. We then analyzed the sets of tweets to identify the most prevalent topics. Results: The most discussed topics had to do with public figures addressing opioid abuse, creating better treatment options for teen addicts, using marijuana as an alternative for managing pain, holding foreign and domestic drug makers accountable for the epidemic, promoting the “Rx for Change” campaign, addressing double-standards in the perceptions and treatment of Black and White opioid users, and advertising opioid recovery programs. Conclusions: Twitter allows users to find current information, voice their concerns, and share calls for action in response to the opioid epidemic. Monitoring the conversations about opioids that are taking place on social media forums like Twitter can help public health officials and care providers better understand how the public is responding to this health crisis. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2018,,Substance Abuse,39,2,129-133,,10.1080/08897077.2017.1356795,,#2760,Glowacki 2018,"",""

Detecting Traces of Bullying in Twitter Posts Using Machine Learning,"Jin, C.; Kaur, H.; Khatun, A.; Uppalapati, S.","There are over 100,000 bullying-related tweets sent through Twitter every week. These social media posts show the prevalence of bullying both online and in the physical world. Researchers find that victims of bullying are more likely to have symptoms of depression. Oftentimes, these tweets are unreported, leaving the victim to face mental consequences when kept in a bullying situation. Natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, however, can efficiently detect bullying-related tweets and bring help to those in need. The purpose of this research was to explore various methods of identifying bullying related tweets posted by various groups, including perpetrators and victims, through NLP and machine learning. We produced word embeddings (word vectors) and used the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm. Then, we trained various machine learning models, including multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN), to improve the predictions for the labels of tweets and observe patterns among them. For binary classification (bullying traces vs. no bullying traces), our CNN model produced the highest area under receiver operating curve (AUROC) of 0.924. AUROC was a more comprehensive metric which accounted for our skewed dataset. For multiclass classification, the tweets were separated into six classes: NA (the tweet was not bullying-related and was not annotated), self-disclosure, report, accusation, denial, and cyberbullying. Our RNN model produced AUROC value for each class, ranging from.854 to.936, for multiclass classification. We aim to implement a script to Twitter to help identify users who are being impacted by bullying and may require mental health assistance.

We evaluated this approach on a corpus of 21 million posts from five patient forums, and conducted a qualitative analysis of the data available on methylphenidate in this corpus. Methods: We applied text mining methods based on named entity recognition and relation extraction in the corpus, followed by signal detection using proportional reporting ratio (PRR). We also used topic modeling based on the Correlated Topic Model to obtain the list of the matics in the corpus and classify the messages based on their topics. Results: We automatically identified 3443 posts about methylphenidate published between 2007 and 2016, among which 61 adverse drug reactions (ADR) were automatically detected. Two pharmacovigilance experts evaluated manually the quality of automatic identification, and a f-measure of 0.57 was reached. Patient's reports were mainly neuro-psychiatric effects. Applying PRR, 67% of the ADRs were signals, including most of the neuro-psychiatric symptoms but also palpitations. Topic modeling showed that the most represented topics were related to Childhood and Treatment initiation, but also Side effects. Cases of misuse were also identified in this corpus, including recreational use and abuse.

Idea density in Japanese for the early detection of dementia based on narrative speech,"Shibata, D.; Ito, K.; Nagai, H.; Okahisa, T.; Kinoshita, A.; Aramaki, E.","Background Idea density (ID), a natural language processing–based index, was developed to aid in the detection of dementia through the analysis of English narratives. However, it has not been applied to non-English languages due to the difficulties in translating grammatical concepts. In this study, we defined rules to count ideas in Japanese narratives based on a previous study and proposed a novel method to estimate ID in Japanese text using machine translation. Materials The study participants comprised 42 Japanese patients with dementia aged 69–98 years (mean: 84.95 years). We collected free narratives from the participants to build a speech corpus. The narratives of the patients were translated into English using three machine translation systems: Google Translate, Bing Translator, and Excite Translator. The ID in the translated text was then calculated using the Dependency-based Propositional ID (DEPID), an English ID scoring tool. Results The maximum correlation coefficient between ID calculated using DEPID-R-ADD (a modified DEPID method to calculate ID after removing vague sentences) and the Mini-Mental State Examination score was 0.473, indicating a moderate correlation. Discussion The results demonstrate the feasibility of machine translation-based ID measurement. We believe that the basic concept of this translation approach can be applied to other non-English languages. © 2018 Shibata et al.

Candyflipping and other combinations: Identifying drug-drug combinations from an online forum,"Chary, M.; Yi, D.; Manini, A.F.","Novel psychoactive substances (NPS) refer to synthetic compounds or derivatives of more widely known substances of abuse that have emerged over the last two decades. Case reports suggest that users combine substances to achieve desired psychotropic experiences while reducing dysphoria and unpleasant somatic effects. However, the pattern of combining NPS has not been studied on a large scale. Here, we show that posts discussing NPS describe combining nootropics with sedative-hypnotics and stimulants with plant hallucinogens or psychiatric medications. Discussions that mention sedative-hypnotics most commonly also mention hallucinogens and stimulants. We analyzed 20 years of publicly available posts from Lycaeum, an Internet forum dedicated to sharing information about psychoactive substance use. We used techniques from natural language processing and machine learning to identify NPS and correlate patterns of co-mentions of substances across posts. We found that conversations mentioning synthetic hallucinogens tended to divide into those mentioning hallucinogens derived from amphetamine and those derived from ergot. Conversations that mentioned synthetic hallucinogens tended not to mention plant hallucinogens. Conversations that mention bath salts commonly mention sedative-hypnotics or nootropics while more canonical stimulants are discussed with plant hallucinogens and psychiatric medications.

SentiNeural: A depression clustering technique for Egyptian women sentiments,"ElDin, D.M.; Taha, M.H.N.; Khalifa, N.E.M.","Online Sentiments Analysis is a trending research domain of study which is based on natural language processing, artificial intelligence, and computational linguistics. Negation sentiments usually are not included in sentiment's analysis process. The depression analysis can be improved by negative sentiments processing. The negation sentiments may contribute to classify the depression problems and its causes. The proposed clustering technique can detect female sentiments from the sentiment's text through cause's classification, and the written sentiment style. The combination of sentiment analysis and neural network is a promising solution for creating a new clustering algorithm. According to Egypt Independent Journal in 2018, 7% of Egyptians suffer from mental illness reported by the Public Health Ministry in Egypt. But the real statistics is more than the mentioned percentage which causes major social problems such as divorce, avoiding responsibilities, or non-marriage. This paper will address the real statistics and cluster the depression causes and social status for each sentiment. Online women sentiments are the essential focus of this research. The proposed technique consists of two algorithms clustering for user's sex and classification algorithm for causes and responsibilities of women. The proposed clustering algorithm can recognize automatically for the sentiments user sex (females or males) and the level of depression automatically. The neural network clustering approach will produce accurate analysis results. The hardness of depression analysis implicitly and explicitly demonstrated in the different classifications for sentiments. This paper introduces a new technique for clustering sentiments and evaluating Egyptian women depression based on social sentiments. © 2018 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited.",2019,,International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,10,5,550-555,,10.14569/ijacsa.2019.0100572,,#2786,ElDin 2019,"",""
"Automated extraction of diagnostic criteria from electronic health records for autism spectrum disorders: Development, evaluation, and application","Leroy, G.; Gu, Y.; Pettygrove, S.; Galindo, M.K.; Arora, A.; Kurzius-Spencer, M.","Background: Electronic health records (EHRs) bring many opportunities for information utilization. One such use is the surveillance conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to track cases of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This process currently comprises manual collection and review of EHRs of 4- and 8-year old children in 11 US states for the presence of ASD criteria. The work is time-consuming and expensive. Objective: Our objective was to automatically extract from EHRs the description of behaviors noted by the clinicians in evidence of the diagnostic criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Previously, we reported on the classification of entire EHRs as ASD or not. In this work, we focus on the extraction of individual expressions of the different ASD criteria in the text. We intend to facilitate large-scale surveillance efforts for ASD and support analysis of changes over time as well as enable integration with other relevant data. Methods: We developed a natural language processing (NLP) parser to extract expressions of 12 DSM criteria using 104 patterns and 92 lexicons (1787 terms). The parser is rule-based to enable precise extraction of the entities from the text. The entities themselves are encompassed in the EHRs as very diverse expressions of the diagnostic criteria written by different people at different times (clinicians, speech pathologists, among others). Due to the sparsity of the data, a rule-based approach is best suited until larger datasets can be generated for machine learning algorithms. Results: We evaluated our rule-based parser and compared it with a machine learning baseline (decision tree). Using a test set of 6636 sentences (50 EHRs), we found that our parser achieved 76% precision, 43% recall (ie, sensitivity), and >99% specificity for criterion extraction. The performance was better for the rule-based approach than for the machine learning baseline (60% precision and 30% recall). For some individual criteria, precision was as high as 97% and recall 57%. Since precision was very high, we were assured that criteria were rarely assigned incorrectly, and our numbers presented a lower bound of their presence in EHRs. We then conducted a case study and parsed 4480 new EHRs covering 10 years of surveillance records from the Arizona Developmental Disabilities Surveillance Program. The social criteria (A1 criteria) showed the biggest change over the years. The communication criteria (A2 criteria) did not distinguish the ASD from the non-ASD records. Among behaviors and interests criteria (A3 criteria), 1 (A3b) was present with much greater frequency in the ASD than in the non-ASD EHRs. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that NLP can support large-scale analysis useful for ASD surveillance and research. In the future, we intend to facilitate detailed analysis and integration of national datasets. ©Gondy Leroy, Yang Gu, Sydney Pettygrove, Maureen K Galindo, Ananyaa Arora, Margaret Kurzius-Spencer.",2018,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,20,11,,,10.2196/10497,,#2787,Leroy 2018,"",""
Detecting comments showing risk for suicide in YouTube,"Gao, J.; Cheng, Q.; Yu, P.L.H.","Natural language processing (NLP) with Cantonese, a mixture of Traditional Chinese, borrowed characters to represent spoken terms, and English, is largely under developed. To apply NLP to detect social media posts showing suicide risk, which is a rare event in regular population, is even more challenging. This paper tried different text mining methods to classify comments in Cantonese on YouTube whether they indicate suicidal risk. Based on word vector feature, classification algorithms such as SVM, AdaBoost, Random Forest, and LSTM are employed to detect the comments’ risk level. To address the imbalance issue of the data, both re-sampling and focal loss methods are used. Based on improvement on both data and algorithm level, the LSTM algorithm can achieve more satisfied testing classification results (84.3% and 84.5% g-mean, respectively).

SynthNotes is a framework for generating standards-compliant, realistic mental health progress report notes at the very large, population-level scale, and in a strict privacy-preserving manner. Our framework, inspired by the needs to explore, evaluate, and train computational methods for the emerging mental health crisis in the US, is useful for benchmarking, optimization, and training of biomedical natural language processing, information extraction, and machine learning systems intended to operate at »Big Data» scale (billions of notes). The free text notes generated by SynthNotes are based on the literature and public statistical models allowing for realistic, natural language representation of a patient, and his or her mental health characteristics. Additionally, SynthNotes can partially simulate stylistic, grammatical, and expressive characteristics of a licensed mental health professional. SynthNotes is modular and flexible, allowing for representation of variety of conditions, incorporation of alternative foundational models, and parametrization of the variability of the structure, content, and size of the synthetically generated corpus.

Understanding the research landscape of major depressive disorder via literature mining: An entity-level analysis of PubMed data from 1948 to 2017,"Zhu, Y.; Kim, M.-H.; Banerjee, S.; Deferio, J.; Alexopoulos, G.S.; Pathak, J.","Objective: To analyze literature-based data from PubMed to identify diseases and medications that have frequently been studied with major depressive disorder (MDD). Materials and methods: Abstracts of 23 799 research articles about MDD that have been published since 1948 till 2017 were analyzed using data and text mining approaches. Methods such as information extraction, frequent pattern mining, regression, and burst detection were used to explore diseases and medications that have been associated with MDD. Results: In addition to many mental disorders and antidepressants, we identified several nonmental health diseases and nonpsychotropic medications that have frequently been studied with MDD. Our results suggest that: (1) MDD has been studied with disorders such as Pain, Diabetes Mellitus, Wounds and Injuries, Hypertension, and Cardiovascular Diseases; (2) medications such as Hydrocortisone, Dexamethasone, Ketamine, and Lithium have been studied in terms of their side effects and off-label uses; (3) the relationships between nonmental disorders and MDD have gained increased attention from the scientific community; and (4) the bursts of Diabetes Mellitus and Cardiovascular Diseases explain the psychiatric and/or depression screening recommended by authoritative associations during the periods of the bursts. Discussion and conclusion: This study summarized and presented an overview of the previous MDD research in terms of diseases and medications that are highly relevant to MDD.

"Analyzing hidden populations online: topic, emotion, and social network of HIV-related users in the largest Chinese online community","Liu, C.; Lu, X.","BACKGROUND: Traditional survey methods are limited in the study of hidden populations due to the hard to access properties, including lack of a sampling frame, sensitivity issue, reporting error, small sample size, etc. The rapid increase of online communities, of which members interact with others via the Internet, have generated large amounts of data, offering new opportunities for understanding hidden populations with unprecedented sample sizes and richness of information. In this study, we try to understand the multidimensional characteristics of a hidden population by analyzing the massive data generated in the online community.; METHODS: By elaborately designing crawlers, we retrieved a complete dataset from the ""HIV bar,"" the largest bar related to HIV on the Baidu Tieba platform, for all records from January 2005 to August 2016. Through natural language processing and social network analysis, we explored the psychology, behavior and demand of online HIV population and examined the network community structure.; RESULTS: In HIV communities, the average topic similarity among members is positively correlated to network efficiency (r = 0.70, p < 0.001), indicating that the closer the social distance between members of the community, the more similar their topics. The proportion of negative users in each community is around 60%, weakly correlated with community size (r = 0.25, p = 0.002). It is found that users suspecting initial HIV infection or first in contact with high-risk behaviors tend to seek help and advice on the social networking platform, rather than immediately going to a hospital for blood tests.; CONCLUSIONS: Online communities have generated copious amounts of data offering new opportunities for understanding hidden populations with unprecedented sample sizes and richness of information.

FABLE: A Semi-Supervised Prescription Information Extraction System,"Tao, C.; Filannino, M.; Uzuner, Ö.","Prescription information is an important component of electronic health records (EHRs). This information contains detailed medication instructions that are crucial for patients' well-being and is often detailed in the narrative portions of EHRs. As a result, narratives of EHRs need to be processed with natural language processing (NLP) methods that can extract medication and prescription information from free text. However, automatic methods for medication and prescription extraction from narratives face two major challenges: (1) dictionaries can fall short even when identifying well-defined and syntactically consistent categories of medication entities, (2) some categories of medication entities are sparse, and at the same time lexically (and syntactically) diverse. In this paper, we describe FABLE, a system for automatically extracting prescription information from discharge summaries. FABLE utilizes unannotated data to enhance annotated training data: it performs semi-supervised extraction of medication information using pseudo-labels with Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to improve its understanding of incomplete, sparse, and diverse medication entities. When evaluated against the official benchmark set from the 2009 i2b2 Shared Task and Workshop on Medication Extraction, FABLE achieves a horizontal phrase-level F1-measure of 0.878, giving state-of-the-art performance and significantly improving on nearly all entity categories.",2018,,AMIA ...

Comorbidities in the diseasome are more apparent than real: What Bayesian filtering reveals about the comorbidities of depression,"Marx, P.; Antal, P.; Bolgar, B.; Bagdy, G.; Deakin, B.; Juhasz, G.","Comorbidity patterns have become a major source of information to explore shared mechanisms of pathogenesis between disorders. In hypothesis-free exploration of comorbid conditions, disease-disease networks are usually identified by pairwise methods. However, interpretation of the results is hindered by several confounders. In particular a very large number of pairwise associations can arise indirectly through other comorbidity associations and they increase exponentially with the increasing breadth of the investigated diseases. To investigate and filter this effect, we computed and compared pairwise approaches with a systems-based method, which constructs a sparse Bayesian direct multimorbidity map (BDMM) by systematically eliminating disease-mediated comorbidity relations. Additionally, focusing on depression-related parts of the BDMM, we evaluated correspondence with results from logistic regression, text-mining and molecular-level measures for comorbidities such as genetic overlap and the interactome-based association score. We used a subset of the UK Biobank Resource, a cross-sectional dataset including 247 diseases and 117,392 participants who filled out a detailed questionnaire about mental health. The sparse comorbidity map confirmed that depressed patients frequently suffer from both psychiatric and somatic comorbid disorders. Notably, anxiety and obesity show strong and direct relationships with depression. The BDMM identified further directly co-morbid somatic disorders, e.g. irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, or migraine. Using the subnetwork of depression and metabolic disorders for functional analysis, the interactome-based system-level score showed the best agreement with the sparse disease network. This indicates that these epidemiologically strong disease-disease relations have improved correspondence with expected molecular-level mechanisms. The substantially fewer number of comorbidity relations in the BDMM compared to pairwise methods implies that biologically meaningful comorbid relations may be less frequent than earlier pairwise methods suggested.

More research is needed to understand user experiences of SCRA-related effects. We use semi-automated information processing techniques through eDrugTrends platform to examine SCRA-related effects and their variations through a longitudinal content analysis of web-forum data. Method English language posts from three drug-focused web-forums were extracted and analyzed between January 1st 2008 and September 30th 2015. Search terms are based on the Drug Use Ontology (DAO) created for this study (189 SCRA-related and 501 effect-related terms). EDrugTrends NLP-based text processing tools were used to extract posts mentioning SCRA and their effects. Generalized linear regression was used to fit restricted cubic spline functions of time to test whether the proportion of drug-related posts that mention SCRA (and no other drug) and the proportion of these “SCRA-only” posts that mention SCRA effects have changed over time, with an adjustment for multiple testing. Results 19,052 SCRA-related posts (Bluelight (n = 2782), Forum A (n = 3882), and Forum B (n = 12,388)) posted by 2543 international users were extracted. The most frequently mentioned effects were “getting high” (44.0%), “hallucinations” (10.8%), and “anxiety” (10.2%). The frequency of SCRA-only posts declined steadily over the study period. The proportions of SCRA-only posts mentioning positive effects (e.g., “High” and “Euphoria”) steadily decreased, while the proportions of SCRA-only posts mentioning negative effects (e.g., “Anxiety,” ‘Nausea,” “Overdose”) increased over the same period.

Enhancing risk assessment in patients receiving chronic opioid analgesic therapy using natural language processing,"Haller, I.V.; Renier, C.M.; Juusola, M.; Hitz, P.; Steffen, W.; Asmus, M.J.; Craig, T.; Mardekian, J.; Masters, E.T.; Elliott, T.E.","Objectives. Clinical guidelines for the use of opioids in chronic noncancer pain recommend assessing risk for aberrant drug-related behaviors prior to initiating opioid therapy. Despite recent dramatic increases in prescription opioidmisuse and abuse, use of screening tools by clinicians continues to be underutilized. This research evaluated natural language processing (NLP) together with other data extraction techniques for risk assessment of patients considered for opioid therapy as a means of predicting opioid abuse. Design. Using a retrospective cohort of 3,668 chronic noncancer pain patients with at least one opioid agreement between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2012, we examined the availability of electronic health record structured and unstructured data to populate the Opioid Risk Tool (ORT) and other selected outcomes. Clinician-documented opioid agreement violations in the clinical notes were determined using NLP techniques followed by manual review of the notes. Results. Confirmed through manual review, the NLP algorithm had 96.1% sensitivity, 92.8% specificity, and 92.6% positive predictive value in identifying opioid agreement violation. At the time of most recent opioid agreement, automated ORT identified 42.8% of patients as at low risk, 28.2% as at moderate risk, and 29.0% as at high risk for opioid abuse. During a year following the agreement, 22.5% of patients had opioid agreement violations. Patients classified as high risk were three times more likely to violate opioid agreements compared with those with low/moderate risk. Conclusion.

Underlying the shallow emotional phenomenology are deeper and more stable strata, such as culture and psychology. This work addresses the latter, by applying text mining methods to the assessment of individual psychometrics. A methodology is described for reducing bulk, unstructured text to low-dimensional numeric feature vectors, from which components of the Myers-Briggs Typology Indicator (MBTI) [2] of the text’s author can be reliably inferred. MBTI is a psychometric schema that emerged from the personality theories of Freud and Jung in the early 20th Century, refined and codified by K. C. Briggs and her daughter, I.

This schema positions people along four (nominally independent) axes between pairs of polar motivations/preferences: Extroversion vs. Introversion (E-I); Intuition vs. Sensing (N-S); Feeling vs. Thinking (F-T); and, Judging vs Perceiving (J-P). Under this schema, each person falls into one of 16 psychometric groups, each designated by a four-character string (e.g., INTJ) [3]. Empirical results are shown for text generated during the social media interaction of over 8,600 PersonalityCafe users [4], all of whom are of known MBTI type. Blind tests to validate the features were conducted for a population (balanced by MBTI type), with exemplars based upon text samples having several thousand words each.

De-identification of clinical notes via recurrent neural network and conditional random field,"Liu, Z.; Tang, B.; Wang, X.; Chen, Q.","De-identification, identifying information from data, such as protected health information (PHI) present in clinical data, is a critical step to enable data to be shared or published. The 2016 Centers of Excellence in Genomic Science (CEGS) Neuropsychiatric Genome-scale and RDOC Individualized Domains (N-GRID) clinical natural language processing (NLP) challenge contains a de-identification track in de-identifying electronic medical records (EMRs) (i.e., track 1). The challenge organizers provide 1000 annotated mental health records for this track, 600 out of which are used as a training set and 400 as a test set. We develop a hybrid system for the de-identification task on the training set. Firstly, four individual subsystems, that is, a subsystem based on bidirectional LSTM (long-short term memory, a variant of recurrent neural network), a subsystem-based on bidirectional LSTM with features, a subsystem based on conditional random field (CRF) and a rule-based subsystem, are used to identify PHI instances. Then, an ensemble learning-based classifiers is deployed to combine all PHI instances predicted by above three machine learning-based subsystems.

How do you #relax when you're #stressed? A content analysis and infodemiology study of stress-related tweets,"Doan, S.; Ritchart, A.; Perry, N.; Chaparro, J.D.; Conway, M.","Background: Stress is a contributing factor to many major health problems in the United States, such as heart disease, depression, and autoimmune diseases. Relaxation is often recommended in mental health treatment as a frontline strategy to reduce stress, thereby improving health conditions. Twitter is a microblog platform that allows users to post their own personal messages (tweets), including their expressions about feelings and actions related to stress and stress management (eg, relaxing). While Twitter is increasingly used as a source of data for understanding mental health from a population perspective, the specific issue of stress-as manifested on Twitter-has not yet been the focus of any systematic study. Objective: The objective of our study was to understand how people express their feelings of stress and relaxation through Twitter messages. In addition, we aimed at investigating automated natural language processing methods to (1) classify stress versus nonstress and relaxation versus nonrelaxation tweets, and (2) identify first-hand experience-that is, who is the experiencer-in stress and relaxation tweets. Methods: We first performed a qualitative content analysis of 1326 and 781 tweets containing the keywords “stress” and “relax,” respectively. We then investigated the use of machine learning algorithms-in particular naive Bayes and support vector machines-to automatically classify tweets as stress versus nonstress and relaxation versus nonrelaxation. Finally, we applied these classifiers to sample datasets drawn from 4 cities in the United States (Los Angeles, New York, San Diego, and San Francisco) obtained from Twitter's streaming application programming interface, with the goal of evaluating the extent of any correlation between our automatic classification of tweets and results from public stress surveys. Results: Content analysis showed that the most frequent topic of stress tweets was education, followed by work and social relationships. The most frequent topic of relaxation tweets was rest & vacation, followed by nature and water. When we applied the classifiers to the cities dataset, the proportion of stress tweets in New York and San Diego was substantially higher than that in Los Angeles and San Francisco. In addition, we found that characteristic expressions of stress and relaxation varied for each city based on its geolocation. Conclusions: This content analysis and infodemiology study revealed that Twitter, when used in conjunction with natural language processing techniques, is a useful data source for understanding stress and stress management strategies, and can potentially supplement infrequently collected survey-based stress data. © Son Doan, Amanda Ritchart, Nicholas Perry, Juan D Chaparro, Mike Conway.

A preliminary automated approach to assess hospital patient feedback,"Ray, J.; Trovati, M.; Minford, S.","Hospitals gather huge amounts of valuable data every day, from clinical studies to patient satisfaction surveys, whose assessment is often carried out either manually or via limited automated approaches. However, improving analysis of hospital data can contribute to a more informed decision-making process with a positive impact on patients. In particular, analysing patients’ feedback can identify potential events, procedures and infrastructure issues, which might potentially affect hospital users’ well-being and medical treatments. This paper discusses an initial implementation of some components of a data analytics tool, which combines a variety of techniques based on text mining and mathematical modelling. It actively assesses real-time data extracted from patients’ feedback, social media and other suitable data created within a hospital setting, allowing immediate action to be taken. This will provide a system, which actively learns positive actions and outcomes whilst discovering actionable information to facilitate the decision-making process, enhance the patient’s journey, and potentially optimise treatment outcomes. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",2018,,Lecture Notes on Data Engineering and Communications Technologies,8,,585-593,,10.1007/978-3-319-65636-6_53,,#2834,Ray 2018,"",""
Using Self-Reported Patient Experiences to Understand Patient Burden: Learnings from Digital Patient Communities in Ankylosing Spondylitis,"Sunkureddi, P.; Gibson, D.; Doogan, S.; Heid, J.; Benosman, S.; Park, Y.","Introduction: Online communities contain a wealth of information containing unsolicited patient experiences that may go beyond what is captured by guided surveys or patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments used in clinical settings. This study described patient experiences reported online to better understand the day-to-day disease burden of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Methods: Unguided, English-language patient narratives reported between January 2010 and May 2016 were collected from 52 online sources (e.g., general/health social networking sites, patient–physician Q&A sites, AS forums). Using natural language processing combined with manual curation, patient-reported experiences within narratives were evaluated and categorized into social, physical, emotional, cognitive, and role activity (SPEC-R) concepts to assess functional impairment. The same SPEC-R categorization was applied to 5 AS-specific PRO instruments to evaluate their coverage of concepts extracted from patient narratives. Results: A total of 34,780 narratives from 3449 patients with AS were included. Physical aspects of AS (e.g., pain and mobility) were most commonly reported by patients (86.7%), followed by emotional (32.5%), cognitive (23.6%), role activity (8.7%) and social (5.1%). Some frequently discussed subconcepts were effectively captured by ≥ 2 PRO instruments, such as pain (65.3%), asthenia (19.9%), musculoskeletal impairment (19.9%), depression (9.9%), and anger/frustration (5.4%); others [e.g., anxiety (19.1%), mental impairment (3.2%), impulsivity (2.9%)] were not addressed by any of the PRO instruments. Conclusion: These findings highlight the importance of analyzing patient experiences beyond clinical trial settings and physician reports; continuous assessment of existing PRO instruments in collaboration with patients may increase their utility in real-world settings.

Identification of primary medication concerns regarding thyroid hormone replacement therapy from online patient medication reviews: Text mining of social network data,"Park, S.H.; Hong, S.H.","Background: Patients with hypothyroidism report poor health-related quality of life despite having undergone thyroid hormone replacement therapy (THRT). Understanding patient concerns regarding levothyroxine can help improve the treatment outcomes of THRT. Objective: This study aimed to (1) identify the distinctive themes in patient concerns regarding THRT, (2) determine whether patients have unique primary medication concerns specific to their demographics, and (3) determine the predictability of primary medication concerns on patient treatment satisfaction. Methods: We collected patient reviews from WebMD in the United States (1037 reviews about generic levothyroxine and 1075 reviews about the brand version) posted between September 1, 2007, and January 30, 2017. We used natural language processing to identify the themes of medication concerns. Multiple regression analyses were conducted in order to examine the predictability of the primary medication concerns on patient treatment satisfaction. Results: Natural language processing of the patient reviews of levothyroxine posted on a social networking site produced 6 distinctive themes of patient medication concerns related to levothyroxine treatment: how to take the drug, treatment initiation, dose adjustment, symptoms of pain, generic substitutability, and appearance. Patients had different primary medication concerns unique to their gender, age, and treatment duration. Furthermore, treatment satisfaction on levothyroxine depended on what primary medication concerns the patient had. Conclusions: Natural language processing of text content available on social media could identify different themes of patient medication concerns that can be validated in future studies to inform the design of tailored medication counseling for improved patient treatment satisfaction. © 2018 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Predicting mental conditions based on “history of present illness” in psychiatric notes with deep neural networks,"Tran, T.; Kavuluru, R.","Background: Applications of natural language processing to mental health notes are not common given the sensitive nature of the associated narratives. The CEGS N-GRID 2016 Shared Task in Clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) changed this scenario by providing the first set of neuropsychiatric notes to participants. This study summarizes our efforts and results in proposing a novel data use case for this dataset as part of the third track in this shared task. Objective: We explore the feasibility and effectiveness of predicting a set of common mental conditions a patient has based on the short textual description of patient's history of present illness typically occurring in the beginning of a psychiatric initial evaluation note. Materials and methods: We clean and process the 1000 records made available through the N-GRID clinical NLP task into a key-value dictionary and build a dataset of 986 examples for which there is a narrative for history of present illness as well as Yes/No responses with regards to presence of specific mental conditions. We propose two independent deep neural network models: one based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and another based on recurrent neural networks with hierarchical attention (ReHAN), the latter of which allows for interpretation of model decisions. We conduct experiments to compare these methods to each other and to baselines based on linear models and named entity recognition (NER). Results: Our CNN model with optimized thresholding of output probability estimates achieves best overall mean micro-F score of 63.144% for 11 common mental conditions with statistically significant gains (p<0.05) over all other models. The ReHAN model with interpretable attention mechanism scored 61.904% mean micro-F1 score. Both models’ improvements over baseline models (support vector machines and NER) are statistically significant. The ReHAN model additionally aids in interpretation of the results by surfacing important words and sentences that lead to a particular prediction for each instance. Conclusions: Although the history of present illness is a short text segment averaging 300 words, it is a good predictor for a few conditions such as anxiety, depression, panic disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Proposed CNN and RNN models outperform baseline approaches and complement each other when evaluating on a per-label basis. © 2017",2017,,Journal of Biomedical Informatics,75,,S138-S148,,10.1016/j.jbi.2017.06.010,,#2850,Tran 2017,"",""

Analysis to the annotated data indicates that valence and arousal fit the classical U-shaped distribution. Most importantly, the annotated results indicate that the same 2-character word that appears in different 4-character words can indeed show distinct affective meanings which implies that the affective meaning of 4-character words may not be compositional to its component words.

Detection of suicide-related posts in Twitter data streams,"Vioules, M.J.; Moulahi, B.; Aze, J.; Bringay, S.","Suicidal ideation detection in online social networks is an emerging research area with major challenges. Recent research has shown that the publicly available information, spread across social media platforms, holds valuable indicators for effectively detecting individuals with suicidal intentions. The key challenge of suicide prevention is understanding and detecting the complex risk factors and warning signs that may precipitate the event. In this paper, we present a new approach that uses the social media platform Twitter to quantify suicide warning signs for individuals and to detect posts containing suicide-related content. The main originality of this approach is the automatic identification of sudden changes in a user's online behavior. To detect such changes, we combine natural language processing techniques to aggregate behavioral and textual features and pass these features through a martingale framework, which is widely used for change detection in data streams. Experiments show that our text-scoring approach effectively captures warning signs in text compared to traditional machine learning classifiers. Additionally, the application of the martingale framework highlights changes in online behavior and shows promise for detecting behavioral changes in at-risk individuals. © 1957-2012 IBM.",2018,,IBM Journal of Research and Development,62,1,,,10.1147/JRD.2017.2768678,,#2873,Vioules 2018,"",""

Natural language processing of electronic health records is increasingly used to study mental health conditions and risk behaviours on a large scale. However, narrative notes written by clinicians do not capture first-hand the patients' own experiences, and only record cross-sectional, professional impressions at the point of care.

Recorded atypical hallucinations in psychotic and affective disorders and associations with non-benzodiazepine hypnotic use: The South London and Maudsley Case Register,"Birnie, K.I.; Stewart, R.; Kolliakou, A.","Objectives Hallucinations are present in many conditions, notably psychosis. Although under-researched, atypical hallucinations, such as tactile, olfactory and gustatory (TOGHs), may arise secondary to hypnotic drug use, particularly non-benzodiazepine hypnotics ('Z drugs'). This retrospective case-control study investigated the frequency of TOGHs and their associations with prior Z drug use in a large mental healthcare database. Methods TOGHs were ascertained in 2014 using a bespoke natural language processing algorithm and were analysed against covariates (including use of Z drugs, demographic factors, diagnosis, disorder severity and other psychotropic medications) ascertained prior to 2014. Results In 43 339 patients with International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Edition schizophreniform or affective disorder diagnoses, 324 (0.75%) had any TOGH recorded (0.54% tactile, 0.24% olfactory, 0.06% gustatory hallucinations). TOGHs were associated with male gender, black ethnicity, schizophreniform diagnosis and higher disorder severity on Health of the National Outcome Scales. In fully adjusted models, tactile and olfactory hallucinations remained independently associated with prior mention of Z drugs (ORs 1.86 and 1.60, respectively). Conclusions We successfully developed a natural language processing algorithm to identify instances of TOGHs in the clinical record. TOGHs overall, tactile and olfactory hallucinations were shown to be associated with prior mention of Z drugs.

We also examined what proportion of service users with a diagnosis of psychosis were recorded as having received CBTp within their episode of care during defined time periods provided by early intervention or promoting recovery community services for people with psychosis, compared with published audits and whether demographic characteristics differentially predicted the receipt of CBTp. Methods Both free text using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and structured methods of identifying CBTp were combined and evaluated for positive predictive value (PPV) and sensitivity. Using inclusion criteria from two published audits, we identified anonymised cross-sectional samples of 2579 and 2308 service users respectively with a case note diagnosis of schizophrenia or psychosis for further analysis. Results The method achieved PPV of 95% and sensitivity of 96%.

"Narratives of transgender people detained in prison: The role played by the utterances ""not"" (as a feeling of hetero- and auto-rejection) and ""exist"" (as a feeling of hetero- and auto-acceptance) for the construction of a discursive self. A suggestion of ","Hochdorn, A.; Faleiros, V.P.; Valerio, P.; Vitelli, R.","Purpose: Understanding how transgender people, who committed criminal offenses and are detained in prison, produce a narrative representation of self within different prison contexts. More specifically, this study has been based on two sub-aims: On a paradigmatic level, it has been aimed at critically investigating how the discursive positioning among the Self and the Other might promote the internalization of positive and/or negative attitudes toward the self. On a pragmatic level, it intends to offer some suggestions for goals and strategies of psychological counseling with these inmates inside such highly institutionalized contexts. Method and Materials: In total, 23 in-depth interviews were conducted with transgender women detained in either female or male prison contexts in Italy and Brazil. The lexical, semantic, and semiotic structure of the transcribed interviews has been investigated by adopting the quali-quantitative software Iramuteq for performing statistical text-mining analysis. Frequency, correspondences, and distribution of themost representative utterances across the corpus of data have been accessed and critically analyzed. Results: The findings showed that transgender inmates in Brazil made repeated use of the adverb ""not,"" while the verb ""exist"" became the most representative word for the Italian sample. In Brazil, indeed, transgender women assumedmasculine-driven behavior due to a common imprisonment with cis-gender men. On the contrary, transgender women in Italy are detained in protected sections, where they are allowed to wear female clothing and continue hormonal treatments. Surprisingly, transgender inmates in Italy suffered more violence in a female sector when compared to exclusively male jails. Conclusions: Transgender people represent a challenge for prison administration because it is not clear in which penitentiary context they should be detained. They should receive special attentions in order to face their special needs, which are radically different when compared to other typologies of inmates. Within penitentiary contexts, psychological counseling with transgender women should pay a special attention to the several psycho-social dimensions of this existential condition. In particular, psychological counselors should consider its inner complex articulation within different social, cultural and normative contexts. © 2018 Hochdorn, Faleiros, Valerio and Vitelli.",2018,,Frontiers in Psychology,8,,,,10.3389/fpsyg.2017.02367,,#2889,Hochdorn 2018,"",""
"Examining thematic similarity, difference, and membership in three online mental health communities from reddit: A text mining and visualization approach","Park, A.; Conway, M.; Chen, A.T.","Objectives Social media, including online health communities, have become popular platforms for individuals to discuss health challenges and exchange social support with others. These platforms can provide support for individuals who are concerned about social stigma and discrimination associated with their illness. Although mental health conditions can share similar symptoms and even co-occur, the extent to which discussion topics in online mental health communities are similar, different, or overlapping is unknown. Discovering the topical similarities and differences could potentially inform the design of related mental health communities and patient education programs. This study employs text mining, qualitative analysis, and visualization techniques to compare discussion topics in publicly accessible online mental health communities for three conditions: Anxiety, Depression and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Methods First, online discussion content for the three conditions was collected from three Reddit communities (r/Anxiety, r/Depression, and r/PTSD). Second, content was pre-processed, and then clustered using the k-means algorithm to identify themes that were commonly discussed by members. Third, we qualitatively examined the common themes to better understand them as well as their similarities and differences. Fourth, we employed multiple visualization techniques to form a deeper understanding of the relationships among the identified themes for the three mental health conditions. Results The three mental health communities shared four themes: sharing of positive emotion, gratitude for receiving emotional support, and sleep- and work-related issues. Depression clusters tended to focus on self-expressed contextual aspects of depression, whereas the Anxiety Disorders and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder clusters addressed more treatment- and medication-related issues. Visualizations showed that discussion topics from the Anxiety Disorders and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder subreddits shared more similarities to one another than to the depression subreddit. Conclusions We observed that the members of the three communities shared several overlapping concerns (i.e., sleep- and work-related problems) and discussion patterns (i.e., sharing of positive emotion and showing gratitude for receiving emotional support). We also highlighted that the discussions from the r/Anxiety and r/PTSD communities were more similar to one another than to discussions from the r/Depression community. The r/Anxiety and r/PTSD subreddit members are more likely to be individuals whose experiences with a condition are long-term, and who are interested in treatments and medications. The r/Depression subreddit members may be a comparatively diffuse group, many of whom are dealing with transient issues that cause depressed mood. The findings from this study could be used to inform the design of online mental health communities and patient education programs for these conditions. Moreover, we suggest that researchers employ multiple methods to fully understand the subtle differences when comparing similar discussions from online health communities. © 2017",2018,,Computers in Human Behavior,78,,98-112,,10.1016/j.chb.2017.09.001,,#2890,Park 2018,"",""
Stopping antidepressants and anxiolytics as major concerns reported in online health communities: A text mining approach,"Abbe, A.; Falissard, B.","Background: Internet is a particularly dynamic way to quickly capture the perceptions of a population in real time. Complementary to traditional face-to-face communication, online social networks help patients to improve self-esteem and self-help. Objective: The aim of this study was to use text mining on material from an online forum exploring patients' concerns about treatment (antidepressants and anxiolytics). Methods: Concerns about treatment were collected from discussion titles in patients' online community related to antidepressants and anxiolytics. To examine the content of these titles automatically, we used text mining methods, such as word frequency in a document-term matrix and co-occurrence of words using a network analysis. It was thus possible to identify topics discussed on the forum. Results: The forum included 2415 discussions on antidepressants and anxiolytics over a period of 3 years. After a preprocessing step, the text mining algorithm identified the 99 most frequently occurring words in titles, among which were escitalopram, withdrawal, antidepressant, venlafaxine, paroxetine, and effect. Patients' concerns were related to antidepressant withdrawal, the need to share experience about symptoms, effects, and questions on weight gain with some drugs. Conclusions: Patients' expression on the Internet is a potential additional resource in addressing patients' concerns about treatment. Patient profiles are close to that of patients treated in psychiatry. © Adeline Abbe, Bruno Falissard.",2017,,JMIR Mental Health,4,4,,,10.2196/mental.7797,,#2891,Abbe 2017,"",""
Automatic recognition of symptom severity from psychiatric evaluation records,"Goodwin, T.R.; Maldonado, R.; Harabagiu, S.M.","This paper presents a novel method for automatically recognizing symptom severity by using natural language processing of psychiatric evaluation records to extract features that are processed by machine learning techniques to assign a severity score to each record evaluated in the 2016 RDoC for Psychiatry Challenge from CEGS/N-GRID. The natural language processing techniques focused on (a) discerning the discourse information expressed in questions and answers; (b) identifying medical concepts that relate to mental disorders; and (c) accounting for the role of negation. The machine learning techniques rely on the assumptions that (1) the severity of a patient's positive valence symptoms exists on a latent continuous spectrum and (2) all the patient's answers and narratives documented in the psychological evaluation records are informed by the patient's latent severity score along this spectrum. These assumptions motivated our two-step machine learning framework for automatically recognizing psychological symptom severity. In the first step, the latent continuous severity score is inferred from each record; in the second step, the severity score is mapped to one of the four discrete severity levels used in the CEGS/N-GRID challenge. We evaluated three methods for inferring the latent severity score associated with each record: (i) pointwise ridge regression; (ii) pairwise comparison-based classification; and (iii) a hybrid approach combining pointwise regression and the pairwise classifier. The second step was implemented using a tree of cascading support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. While the official evaluation results indicate that all three methods are promising, the hybrid approach not only outperformed the pairwise and pointwise methods, but also produced the second highest performance of all submissions to the CEGS/N-GRID challenge with a normalized MAE score of 84.093% (where higher numbers indicate better performance). These evaluation results enabled us to observe that, for this task, considering pairwise information can produce more accurate severity scores than pointwise regression – an approach widely used in other systems for assigning severity scores. Moreover, our analysis indicates that using a cascading SVM tree outperforms traditional SVM classification methods for the purpose of determining discrete severity levels. © 2017",2017,,Journal of Biomedical Informatics,75,,S71-S84,,10.1016/j.jbi.2017.05.020,,#2899,Goodwin 2017,"",""

To achieve this, we implemented SemEHR, an open source semantic search and analytics tool for EHRs. Methods: SemEHR implements a generic information extraction (IE) and retrieval infrastructure by identifying contextualized mentions of a wide range of biomedical concepts within EHRs. Natural language processing annotations are further assembled at the patient level and extended with EHR-specific knowledge to generate a timeline for each patient. The semantic data are serviced via ontology-based search and analytics interfaces. Results: SemEHR has been deployed at a number of UK hospitals, including the Clinical Record Interactive Search, an anonymized replica of the EHR of the UK South London and Maudsley National Health Service Foundation Trust, one of Europe's largest providers of mental health services. In 2 Clinical Record Interactive Search-based studies, SemEHR achieved 93% (hepatitis C) and 99% (HIV) F-measure results in identifying true positive patients. At King's College Hospital in London, as part of the CogStack program (github.com/cogstack), SemEHR is being used to recruit patients into the UK Department of Health 100 000 Genomes Project (genomicsengland. co.uk). The validation study suggests that the tool can validate previously recruited cases and is very fast at searching phenotypes; time for recruitment criteria checking was reduced from days to minutes. Validated on open intensive care EHR data, Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III, the vital signs extracted by SemEHR can achieve around 97% accuracy. Conclusion: Results from the multiple case studies demonstrate SemEHR's efficiency: weeks or months of work can be done within hours or minutes in some cases.

Deception detection in Russian texts,"Litvinova, O.; Litvinova, T.; Seredin, P.; Lyell, J.","Psychology studies show that people detect deception no more accurately than by chance, and it is therefore important to develop tools to enable the detection of deception. The problem of deception detection has been studied for a significant amount of time, however in the last 10- 15 years we have seen methods of computational linguistics being employed with greater frequency. Texts are processed using different NLP tools and then classified as deceptive/truthful using modern machine learning methods. While most of this research has been performed for the English language, Slavic languages have never been the focus of detection deception studies. This paper deals with deception detection in Russian narratives related to the theme ""How I Spent Yesterday"". It employs a specially designed corpus of truthful and deceptive texts on the same topic from each respondent, such that N = 113. The texts were processed using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count software that is used in most studies of text-based deception detection. The average amount of parameters, a majority of which were related to Part-of-Speech, lexical-semantic group, and other frequencies. Using standard statistical analysis, statistically significant differences between false and truthful Russian texts was uncovered. On the basis of the chosen parameters our classifier reached an accuracy of 68.3%. The accuracy of the model was found to depend on the author's gender. © 2017 Association for Computational Linguistics.",2017,,"15th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, EACL 2017 - Proceedings of the Student Research Workshop",,,43-52,,10.18653/v1/e17-4005,,#2913,Litvinova 2017,"",""
Novel Use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to Predict Suicidal Ideation and Psychiatric Symptoms in a Text-Based Mental Health Intervention in Madrid,"Cook, B.L.; Progovac, A.M.; Chen, P.; Mullin, B.; Hou, S.; Baca-Garcia, E.","Natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning were used to predict suicidal ideation and heightened psychiatric symptoms among adults recently discharged from psychiatric inpatient or emergency room settings in Madrid, Spain. Participants responded to structured mental and physical health instruments at multiple follow-up points. Outcome variables of interest were suicidal ideation and psychiatric symptoms (GHQ-12). Predictor variables included structured items (e.g., relating to sleep and well-being) and responses to one unstructured question, ""how do you feel today?"" We compared NLP-based models using the unstructured question with logistic regression prediction models using structured data. The PPV, sensitivity, and specificity for NLP-based models of suicidal ideation were 0.61, 0.56, and 0.57, respectively, compared to 0.73, 0.76, and 0.62 of structured data-based models. The PPV, sensitivity, and specificity for NLP-based models of heightened psychiatric symptoms (GHQ-12 ≥ 4) were 0.56, 0.59, and 0.60, respectively, compared to 0.79, 0.79, and 0.85 in structured models. NLP-based models were able to generate relatively high predictive values based solely on responses to a simple general mood question. These models have promise for rapidly identifying persons at risk of suicide or psychological distress and could provide a low-cost screening alternative in settings where lengthy structured item surveys are not feasible. © 2016 Benjamin L.

Developing a web-based SKOS editor,"Conway, M.; Khojoyan, A.; Fana, F.; Scuba, W.; Castine, M.; Mowery, D.; Chapman, W.; Jupp, S.","Background: The Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) was introduced to the wider research community by a 2005 World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) working draft, and further developed and refined in a 2009 W3C recommendation. Since then, SKOS has become the de facto standard for representing and sharing thesauri, lexicons, vocabularies, taxonomies, and classification schemes. In this paper, we describe the development of a web-based, free, open-source SKOS editor built for the development, curation, and management of small to medium-sized lexicons for health-related Natural Language Processing (NLP). Results: The web-based SKOS editor allows users to create, curate, version, manage, and visualise SKOS resources. We tested the system against five widely-used, publicly-available SKOS vocabularies of various sizes and found that the editor is suitable for the development and management of small to medium-size lexicons. Qualitative testing has focussed on using the editor to develop lexical resources to drive NLP applications in two domains. First, developing a lexicon to support an Electronic Health Record-based NLP system for the automatic identification of pneumonia symptoms. Second, creating a taxonomy of lexical cues associated with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) diagnoses with the goal of facilitating the automatic identification of symptoms associated with depression from short, informal texts. Conclusions: The SKOS editor we have developed is - to the best of our knowledge - the first free, open-source, web-based, SKOS editor capable of creating, curating, versioning, managing, and visualising SKOS lexicons. © 2015 Conway et al.",2016,,Journal of Biomedical Semantics,7,1,,,10.1186/s13326-015-0043-z,,#2928,Conway 2016,"",""
Predictors of care home and hospital admissions and their costs for older people with Alzheimer's disease: Findings from a large London case register,"Knapp, M.; Chua, K.-C.; Broadbent, M.; Chang, C.-K.; Fernandez, J.-L.; Milea, D.; Romeo, R.; Lovestone, S.; Spencer, M.; Thompson, G.; Stewart, R.; Hayes, R.D.","Objectives: To examine links between clinical and other characteristics of people with Alzheimer's disease living in the community, likelihood of care home or hospital admission, and associated costs. Design: Observational data extracted from clinical records using natural language processing and Hospital Episode Statistics. Statistical analyses examined effects of cognition, physical health, mental health, sociodemographic factors and living circumstances on risk of admission to care home or hospital over 6 months and associated costs, adjusting for repeated observations. Setting: Catchment area for South London and Maudsley National Health Service Foundation Trust, provider for 1.2 million people in Southeast London. Participants: Every individual with diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease seen and treated by mental health services in the catchment area, with at least one rating of cognition, not resident in care home at time of assessment (n=3075). Interventions: Usual treatment. Main outcome measures: Risk of admission to, and days spent in three settings during 6-month period following routine clinical assessment: care home, mental health inpatient care and general hospital inpatient care. Results: Predictors of probability of care home or hospital admission and/or associated costs over 6 months include cognition, functional problems, agitation, depression, physical illness, previous hospitalisations, age, gender, ethnicity, living alone and having a partner. Patterns of association differed considerably by destination. Conclusions: Most people with dementia prefer to remain in their own homes, and funding bodies see this as cheaper than institutionalisation. Better treatment in the community that reduces health and social care needs of Alzheimer's patients would reduce admission rates. Living alone, poor living circumstances and functional problems all raise admission rates, and so major cuts in social care budgets increase the risk of high-cost admissions which older people do not want. Routinely collected data can be used to reveal local patterns of admission and costs. © 2016 Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.",2016,,BMJ Open,6,11,,,10.1136/bmjopen-2016-013591,,#2931,Knapp 2016,"",""
Lexicon-based system for drug abuse entity extraction from Twitter,"Jenhani, F.; Gouider, M.S.; Said, L.B.","Drug abuse and addiction is a serious healthcare problem and social phenomenon that has not received the interest deserved in scientific research due to the lack of information.

Text mining for identifying topics in the literatures about adolescent substance use and depression,"Wang, S.-H.; Ding, Y.; Zhao, W.; Huang, Y.-H.; Perkins, R.; Zou, W.; Chen, J.J.","Background: Both adolescent substance use and adolescent depression are major public health problems, and have the tendency to co-occur. Thousands of articles on adolescent substance use or depression have been published. It is labor intensive and time consuming to extract huge amounts of information from the cumulated collections. Topic modeling offers a computational tool to find relevant topics by capturing meaningful structure among collections of documents. Methods: In this study, a total of 17,723 abstracts from PubMed published from 2000 to 2014 on adolescent substance use and depression were downloaded as objects, and Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) was applied to perform text mining on the dataset. Word clouds were used to visually display the content of topics and demonstrate the distribution of vocabularies over each topic. Results: The LDA topics recaptured the search keywords in PubMed, and further discovered relevant issues, such as intervention program, association links between adolescent substance use and adolescent depression, such as sexual experience and violence, and risk factors of adolescent substance use, such as family factors and peer networks. Using trend analysis to explore the dynamics of proportion of topics, we found that brain research was assessed as a hot issue by the coefficient of the trend test. Conclusions: Topic modeling has the ability to segregate a large collection of articles into distinct themes, and it could be used as a tool to understand the literature, not only by recapturing known facts but also by discovering other relevant topics. © 2016 Wang et al.",2016,,BMC Public Health,16,1,,,10.1186/s12889-016-2932-1,,#2944,Wang 2016,"",""

Setting Electronic records from a large mental healthcare provider serving a geographic catchment of 1.2 million residents in four boroughs of south London, UK. Participants The distribution of derived symptoms was described in 23128 discharge summaries from 7962 patients who had received an SMI diagnosis, and 13496 discharge summaries from 7575 patients who had received a non-SMI diagnosis. Outcome measures Fifty SMI symptoms were identified by a team of psychiatrists for extraction based on salience and linguistic consistency in records, broadly categorised under positive, negative, disorganisation, manic and catatonic subgroups.

Electronic health records (EHRs) can be used to create retrospective clinical cohort data for large samples of children with ASD. However systems to accurately extract suicidality-related concepts need to be developed so that putative models of suicide risk in ASD can be explored. We present a systematic approach to 1) adapt Natural Language Processing (NLP) solutions to screen with high sensitivity for reference to suicidal constructs in a large clinical ASD EHR corpus (230,465 documents), and 2) evaluate within a screened subset of 500 patients, the performance of an NLP classification tool for positive and negated suicidal mentions within clinical text. When evaluated, the NLP classification tool showed high system performance for positive suicidality with precision, recall, and F1 scores all > 0.85 at a document and patient level. The application therefore provides accurate output for epidemiological research into the factors contributing to the onset and recurrence of suicidality, and potential utility within clinical settings as an automated surveillance or risk prediction tool for specialist ASD services.",2017,,AMIA ...

Predicting early psychiatric readmission with natural language processing of narrative discharge summaries,"Rumshisky, A.; Ghassemi, M.; Naumann, T.; Szolovits, P.; Castro, V.M.; McCoy, T.H.; Perlis, R.H.","The ability to predict psychiatric readmission would facilitate the development of interventions to reduce this risk, a major driver of psychiatric health-care costs. The symptoms or characteristics of illness course necessary to develop reliable predictors are not available in coded billing data, but may be present in narrative electronic health record (EHR) discharge summaries. We identified a cohort of individuals admitted to a psychiatric inpatient unit between 1994 and 2012 with a principal diagnosis of major depressive disorder, and extracted inpatient psychiatric discharge narrative notes. Using these data, we trained a 75-topic Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, a form of natural language processing, which identifies groups of words associated with topics discussed in a document collection. The cohort was randomly split to derive a training (70%) and testing (30%) data set, and we trained separate support vector machine models for baseline clinical features alone, baseline features plus common individual words and the above plus topics identified from the 75-topic LDA model. Of 4687 patients with inpatient discharge summaries, 470 were readmitted within 30 days. The 75-topic LDA model included topics linked to psychiatric symptoms (suicide, severe depression, anxiety, trauma, eating/weight and panic) and major depressive disorder comorbidities (infection, postpartum, brain tumor, diarrhea and pulmonary disease).

While many individuals who die by suicide are seen by physicians before their attempt, theymay not seek psychiatric care. OBJECTIVE To determine the extent to which incorporating natural language processing of narrative discharge notes improves stratification of risk for death by suicide after medical or surgical hospital discharge. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this retrospective health care use study, clinical data were analyzed from individuals with discharges from 2 large academic medical centers between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2013. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomewas suicide as a reported cause of death based on Massachusetts Department of Public Health records. Regression models for prediction of death by suicide or accidental death were compared relying solely on coded clinical data and those using natural language processing of hospital discharge notes. RESULTS There were 845 417 hospital discharges represented in the cohort, including 458 053 unique individuals. Overall, all-cause mortality was 18%during 9 years, and the median follow-up was 5.2 years. The cohort included 235 (0.1%) who died by suicide during 2.4 million patient-years of follow-up. Positive valence reflected in narrative notes was associated with a 30% reduction in risk for suicide in models adjusted for coded sociodemographic and clinical features (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95%CI, 0.58-0.85; P < .001) and improved model fit (x2 2 = 14.843, P < .001 by log-likelihood test).

Interweaving domain knowledge and unsupervised learning for psychiatric stressor extraction from clinical notes,"Zhang, O.R.; Zhang, Y.; Xu, J.; Roberts, K.; Zhang, X.Y.; Xu, H.","Mental health is an increasingly important problem in healthcare. Psychiatric stressors are one of the major contributors of mental disorders. Very few studies have investigated stressor data in electronic health records, mostly because they are recorded in narrative texts. This study takes the initiative to develop a natural language processing system to automatically extract psychiatric stressors from clinical notes.

Language sample analysis framework utilizing the natural language toolkit and social media,"Abualsamid, A.; Hughes, C.E.","In this paper we present the Analysis of Social Discourse Framework (ASDF), which utilizes the Natural Language Toolkit [1] (NLTK 3.0 documentation. http://www.nltk.org) to analyze language samples from children on the Autism Spectrum. For those whose anxiety prohibits them from providing speech samples in response to guided elicitation we utilize free form social media posts to obtain the language samples. To demonstrate the value of ASDF, we present a formative case study illustrating the collection of samples via social media posts and the resulting analysis. In addition to providing metrics traditionally used in speech sample analysis, ASDF provides new metrics made possible through natural language processing.

In this paper, we update this register's descriptive data, and describe the substantial expansion and extension of the data resource since its original development. Participants: Descriptive data were generated from the SLaM BRC Case Register on 31 December 2014. Currently, there are over 250 000 patient records accessed through CRIS. Findings to date: Since 2008, the most significant developments in the SLaM BRC Case Register have been the introduction of natural language processing to extract structured data from open-text fields, linkages to external sources of data, and the addition of a parallel relational database (Structured Query Language) output. Natural language processing applications to date have brought in new and hitherto inaccessible data on cognitive function, education, social care receipt, smoking, diagnostic statements and pharmacotherapy. In addition, through external data linkages, large volumes of supplementary information have been accessed on mortality, hospital attendances and cancer registrations. Future plans: Coupled with robust data security and governance structures, electronic health records provide potentially transformative information on mental disorders and outcomes in routine clinical care. The SLaM BRC Case Register continues to grow as a database, with approximately 20 000 new cases added each year, in addition to extension of follow-up for existing cases. Data linkages and natural language processing present important opportunities to enhance this type of research resource further, achieving both volume and depth of data.

Healthcare costs and resource utilization of patients with binge-eating disorder and eating disorder not otherwise specified in the Department of Veterans Affairs,"Bellows, B.K.; DuVall, S.L.; Kamauu, A.W.C.; Supina, D.; Babcock, T.; LaFleur, J.","Objective The objective of this study was to compare the one-year healthcare costs and utilization of patients with binge-eating disorder (BED) to patients with eating disorder not otherwise specified without BED (EDNOS-only) and to matched patients without an eating disorder (NED). Methods A natural language processing (NLP) algorithm identified adults with BED from clinical notes in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) electronic health record database from 2000 to 2011. Patients with EDNOS-only were identified using ICD-9 code (307.50) and those with NLP-identified BED were excluded. First diagnosis date defined the index date for both groups. Patients with NED were randomly matched 4:1, as available, to patients with BED on age, sex, BMI, depression diagnosis, and index month. Patients with cost data (2005-2011) were included. Total healthcare, inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy costs were examined. Generalized linear models were used to compare total one-year healthcare costs while adjusting for baseline patient characteristics. Results There were 257 BED, 743 EDNOS-only, and 823 matched NED patients identified. The mean (SD) total unadjusted one-year costs, in 2011 US dollars, were $33,716 ($38,928) for BED, $37,052 ($40,719) for EDNOS-only, and $19,548 ($35,780) for NED patients. When adjusting for patient characteristics, BED patients had one-year total healthcare costs $5,589 higher than EDNOS-only (p = 0.06) and $18,152 higher than matched NED patients (p < 0.001).

Automated concept and relationship extraction for the semi-automated ontology management (SEAM) system,"Doing-Harris, K.; Livnat, Y.; Meystre, S.","Background: We develop medical-specialty specific ontologies that contain the settled science and common term usage. We leverage current practices in information and relationship extraction to streamline the ontology development process. Our system combines different text types with information and relationship extraction techniques in a low overhead modifiable system. Our SEmi-Automated ontology Maintenance (SEAM) system features a natural language processing pipeline for information extraction. Synonym and hierarchical groups are identified using corpus-based semantics and lexico-syntactic patterns. The semantic vectors we use are term frequency by inverse document frequency and context vectors. Clinical documents contain the terms we want in an ontology. They also contain idiosyncratic usage and are unlikely to contain the linguistic constructs associated with synonym and hierarchy identification. By including both clinical and biomedical texts, SEAM can recommend terms from those appearing in both document types. The set of recommended terms is then used to filter the synonyms and hierarchical relationships extracted from the biomedical corpus. We demonstrate the generality of the system across three use cases: ontologies for acute changes in mental status, Medically Unexplained Syndromes, and echocardiogram summary statements. Results: Across the three uses cases, we held the number of recommended terms relatively constant by changing SEAM's parameters. Experts seem to find more than 300 recommended terms to be overwhelming. The approval rate of recommended terms increased as the number and specificity of clinical documents in the corpus increased. It was 60% when there were 199 clinical documents that were not specific to the ontology domain and 90% when there were 2879 documents very specific to the target domain. We found that fewer than 100 recommended synonym groups were also preferred. Approval rates for synonym recommendations remained low varying from 43% to 25% as the number of journal articles increased from 19 to 47. Overall the number of recommended hierarchical relationships was very low although approval was good. It varied between 67% and 31%. Conclusion: SEAM produced a concise list of recommended clinical terms, synonyms and hierarchical relationships regardless of medical domain. © 2015 Doing-Harris et al.; licensee BioMed Central.",2015,,Journal of Biomedical Semantics,6,1,,,10.1186/s13326-015-0011-7,,#3018,Doing-Harris 2015,"",""

Treatment-resistant depression is a common clinical occurrence among patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), but its neurobiology is poorly understood. We used data collected as part of routine clinical care to study white matter integrity of the brain's limbic system and its association to treatment response. Methods. Electronic medical records of multiple large New England hospitals were screened for patients with an MDD billing diagnosis, and natural language processing was subsequently applied to find those with concurrent diffusion-weighted images, but without any diagnosed brain pathology. Treatment outcome was determined by review of clinical charts. MDD patients (n = 29 non-remitters, n = 26 partial-remitters, and n = 37 full-remitters), and healthy control subjects (n = 58) were analyzed for fractional anisotropy (FA) of the fornix and cingulum bundle. Results. Failure to achieve remission was associated with lower FA among MDD patients, statistically significant for the medial body of the fornix. Moreover, global and regional-selective age-related FA decline was most pronounced in patients with treatment-refractory, non-remitted depression. Conclusions. These findings suggest that specific brain microstructural white matter abnormalities underlie persistent, treatment-resistant depression.

Monitoring suicidal patients in primary care using electronic health records,"Anderson, H.D.; Pace, W.D.; Brandt, E.; Nielsen, R.D.; Allen, R.R.; Libby, A.M.; West, D.R.; Valuck, R.J.","Introduction: Patients at risk for suicide often come into contact with primary care providers, many of whom use electronic health records (EHRs) for charting. It is not known, however, how often suicide ideation or attempts are documented in EHRs. Methods: We used retrospective analyses of de-identified EHR data from a distributed health network of primary care organizations to estimate the frequency of using diagnostic codes to record suicidal ideation and attempts. Data came from 3 sources: a clinician notes field processed using natural language processing; a suicidal ideation item on a patient-reported depression severity instrument (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9]); and diagnostic codes from the EHR. Results: Only 3% of patients with an indication of suicidal ideation in the notes field had a corresponding International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9), code (κ = 0.036). Agreement between an indication of suicidal ideation from item 9 of the PHQ-9 and an ICD-9 code was slightly higher (κ = 0.068). Suicide attempt indicated in the notes field was more likely to be recorded using an ICD-9 code (19%;κ = 0.18).

Identifying psychological theme words from emotion annotated interviews,"Brahmachari, A.; Singh, P.; Garg, A.; Das, D.","Recent achievements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Psychology invoke the challenges to identify the insight of emotions. In the present study, we have identified different psychology related theme words while analyzing emotions on the interview data of ISEAR (International Survey of Emotion Antecedents and Reactions) research group.

We have discussed some of the interesting results as observed from the generated visual graphs. On the other hand, different text clusters are identified from the interview statements by selecting individual as well as different combinations of the variables. Such textual clusters are used not only for retrieving the psychological theme words but also to classify the theme words into their respective emotion classes. In order to retrieve the psychological theme words from the text clusters, we have developed a rule based baseline system considering unigram based keyword spotting technique. The system has been evaluated based on a Top-n ranking strategy (where n=10, 20 or 30 most frequent theme words). Overall, the system achieves the average F-Scores of .42, .32, .36, .42, .35, .40 and .40 in identifying theme words with respect to Joy, Anger, Disgust, Fear, Guilt, Sadness and Shame emotion classes, respectively. © 2013 Springer International Publishing.",2013,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),8284 LNAI,,728-739,,10.1007/978-3-319-03844-5_71,,#3024,Brahmachari 2013,"",""
Efficacy of neurolinguistic programming training on mental health in nursing and midwifery students,"Sahebalzamani, M.","Background: Neurolinguistic programming (NLP) refers to the science and art of reaching success and perfection. It is a collection of the skills based on human beings' psychological characteristics through which the individuals obtain the ability to use their personal capabilities as much as possible.

"Five-Dimensional Sentiment Analysis of Corpora, Documents and Words","Honkela, T.; Korhonen, J.; Lagus, K.; Saarinen, E.","Sentiment analysis has become a widely used approach to assess the emotional content of written documents such as customer feedback. In positive psychology research, the typical one-dimensional analysis framework has been extended to include five dimensions. This five-dimensional model, PERMA, enables a fine-grained analysis of written texts. We propose an approach in which this model, statistical analysis and the self-organizing map are used. We analyze corpora from various genres. A hybrid methodology that uses the self-organizing maps algorithm and human judgment is suggested for expanding the PERMA lexicon. This vocabulary expansion can be useful for English but it is potentially even more crucial in the case of other languages for which the lexicon is not readily available.

We exploit fine-grained drug related adverse event information extracted by text mining from electronic medical records (EMRs) to stratify patients based on their adverse events and to determine adverse event co-occurrences. Methods: We analyzed the similarity of adverse event profiles of 2347 patients extracted from EMRs from a mental health center in Denmark. The patients were clustered based on their adverse event profiles and the similarities were presented as a network. The set of adverse events in each main patient cluster was evaluated. Co-occurrences of adverse events in patients (p-value &#60; 0.01) were identified and presented as well. Results: We found that each cluster of patients typically had a most distinguishing adverse event. Examination of the co-occurrences of adverse events in patients led to the identification of potentially interesting adverse event correlations that may be further investigated as well as provide further patient stratification opportunities. Conclusions: We have demonstrated the feasibility of a novel approach in pharmacovigilance to stratify patients based on fine-grained adverse event profiles, which also makes it possible to identify adverse event correlations.

Large, rare copy number variants (CNVs) play a role in other neuropsychiatric diseases, so we assessed their association with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Methods: We analyzed data from two genome-wide association studies comprising 1263 Caucasian patients with major depressive disorder. One was drawn from a large health system by applying natural language processing to electronic health records (i2b2 cohort). The second consisted of a multicenter study of sequential antidepressant treatments, Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression. The Birdsuite package was used to identify rare deletions and duplications. Individuals without symptomatic remission, despite two antidepressant treatment trials, were contrasted with those who remitted with a first treatment trial. Results: CNV data were derived for 778 subjects in the i2b2 cohort, including 300 subjects (37%) with TRD, and 485 subjects in Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression cohort, including 152 (31%) with TRD. CNV burden analyses identified modest enrichment of duplications in cases (empirical p = .04 for duplications of 100-200 kilobase) and a particular deletion region spanning gene PABPC4L (empirical p = .02, 6 cases: 0 controls). Pathway analysis suggested enrichment of CNVs intersecting genes regulating actin cytoskeleton. However, none of these associations survived genome-wide correction.

The extent of modifiable risk factors - both clinical and socio-demographic - is unclear as most studies have used administrative data or recruited from specialist tertiary referral clinics. We therefore aimed to investigate the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of an epidemiologically representative cohort of pregnant women with affective and non-affective severe mental illness. Methods: Women with severe mental illness were identified from a large electronic mental health case register in south London, and a data linkage with national maternity Hospital Episode Statistics identified pregnancies in 2007-2011. Data were extracted using structured fields, text searching and natural language processing applications. Results: Of 456 pregnant women identified, 236 (51.7%) had schizophrenia and related disorders, 220 (48.3%) had affective psychosis or bipolar disorder. Women with schizophrenia and related disorders were younger, less likely to have a partner in pregnancy, more likely to be black, to smoke or misuse substances and had significantly more time in the two years before pregnancy in acute care (inpatient or intensive home treatment) compared with women with affective disorders. Both groups had high levels of domestic abuse in pregnancy (recorded in 18.9%), were from relatively deprived backgrounds and had impaired functioning measured by the Health of the Nation Outcome Scale. Women in the affective group were more likely to stop medication in the first trimester (39% versus 25%) whereas women with non-affective psychoses were more likely to switch medication. Conclusions: A significant proportion of women, particularly those with non-affective psychoses, have modifiable risk factors requiring tailored care to optimize pregnancy outcomes.

The number of unique antipsychotics prescribed, mediated increased frequency of hospital admission (natural indirect effect 1.09, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.18; total effect 1.50, 1.21 to 1.87), increased likelihood of compulsory admission (natural indirect effect (NIE) 1.27, 1.03 to 1.58; total effect (TE) 1.76, 0.81 to 3.84) and greater number of days spent in hospital (NIE 17.9, 2.4 to 33.4; TE 34.8, 11.6 to 58.1). Conclusions: Cannabis use in patients with FEP was associated with an increased likelihood of hospital admission. This was linked to the prescription of several different antipsychotic drugs, indicating clinical judgement of antipsychotic treatment failure. Together, this suggests that cannabis use might be associated with worse clinical outcomes in psychosis by contributing towards failure of antipsychotic treatment.",2016,,BMJ Open,6,3,,,10.1136/bmjopen-2015-009888,,#3064,Patel 2016,"",""

Inference of the Russian drug community from one of the largest social networks in the Russian Federation,"Dijkstra, L.J.; Yakushev, A.V.; Duijn, P.A.C.; Boukhanovsky, A.V.; Sloot, P.M.A.","The criminal nature of narcotics complicates the direct assessment of a drug community, while having a good understanding of the type of people drawn or currently using drugs is vital for finding effective intervening strategies. Especially for the Russian Federation this is of immediate concern given the dramatic increase it has seen in drug abuse since the fall of the Soviet Union in the early nineties.

Identifying phenotypic signatures of neuropsychiatric disorders from electronic medical records,"Lyalina, S.; Percha, B.; Lependu, P.; Iyer, S.V.; Altman, R.B.; Shah, N.H.","Objective: Mental illness is the leading cause of disability in the USA, but boundaries between different mental illnesses are notoriously difficult to define. Electronic medical records (EMRs) have recently emerged as a powerful new source of information for defining the phenotypic signatures of specific diseases. We investigated how EMR-based text mining and statistical analysis could elucidate the phenotypic boundaries of three important neuropsychiatric illnesses-autism, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Methods: We analyzed the medical records of over 7000 patients at two facilities using an automated textprocessing pipeline to annotate the clinical notes with Unified Medical Language System codes and then searching for enriched codes, and associations among codes, that were representative of the three disorders. We used dimensionality-reduction techniques on individual patient records to understand individual-level phenotypic variation within each disorder, as well as the degree of overlap among disorders. Results: We demonstrate that automated EMR mining can be used to extract relevant drugs and phenotypes associated with neuropsychiatric disorders and characteristic patterns of associations among them. Patient-level analyses suggest a clear separation between autism and the other disorders, while revealing significant overlap between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. They also enable localization of individual patients within the phenotypic 'landscape' of each disorder. Conclusions: Because EMRs reflect the realities of patient care rather than idealized conceptualizations of disease states, we argue that automated EMR mining can help define the boundaries between different mental illnesses, facilitate cohort building for clinical and genomic studies, and reveal how clear expert-defined disease boundaries are in practice.",2013,,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association,20,E2,E297-E305,,10.1136/amiajnl-2013-001933,,#3068,Lyalina 2013,"",""

Literature-based discovery may help to investigate the patterns of multimorbidity and to integrate medical knowledge for improving healthcare delivery for individuals with co-occurring chronic conditions. Objective To explore the usefulness of literature-based discovery in primary care research through the key-case of finding associations between psychiatric and somatic diseases relevant to general practice in a large biomedical literature database (Medline). Methods By using literature based discovery for matching disease profiles as vectors in a highdimensional associative concept space, co-occurrences of a broad spectrum of chronic medical conditions were matched for their potential in biomedicine. An experimental setting was chosen in parallel with expert evaluations and expert meetings to assess performance and to generate targets for integrating literature-based discovery in multidisciplinary medical research of psychiatric and somatic disease associations. Results Through stepwise reductions a reference set of 21 945 disease combinations was generated, from which a set of 166 combinations between psychiatric and somatic diseases was selected and assessed by text mining and expert evaluation. Conclusions Literature-based discovery tools generate specific patterns of associations between psychiatric and somatic diseases: one subset was appraised as promising for further research; the other subset surprised the experts, leading to intricate discussions and further eliciting of frameworks of biomedical knowledge.

Implementation of evidence-based psychotherapies for posttraumatic stress disorder in VA specialty clinics,"Watts, B.V.; Shiner, B.; Zubkoff, L.; Carpenter-Song, E.; Ronconi, J.M.; Coldwell, C.M.","Objective: The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has engaged in substantial efforts to promote the use of evidence-based psychotherapies for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The authors evaluated the effectiveness of these efforts. Methods: This study used a cross-sectional, mixed-methods evaluation of treatment provided by the VA at specialty PTSD clinics in New England during the first six months of fiscal year 2010. Natural language processing algorithms were applied to clinical notes to determine utilization of evidence-based psychotherapy (prolonged exposure therapy and cognitive-processing therapy) among patients who were newly diagnosed as having PTSD. Data regarding efforts to implement evidence-based psychotherapy and other clinic characteristics were obtained through qualitative interviews with clinical and administrative staff (N=30), and the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services framework was used to identify clinic factors associated with use of evidence-based psychotherapy. Results: Six percent of patients (N=1,924) received any sessions of an evidence-based psychotherapy for PTSD (median=five sessions). Several clinic factors were associated with an increased rate of implementation, including prior experience with use of the treatments, customization of training, and prolonged contact with the implementation and training team. Facilitation with broad training goals and clinics with highly organized systems of care were negatively associated with implementation. Conclusions: Few patients with PTSD received evidence-based psychotherapy for PTSD during their first six months of treatment at a VA specialty PTSD clinic. The implementation framework poorly predicted factors associated with uptake of evidence-based psychotherapy. These results suggest that additional research is needed to understand implementation of evidence-based therapy in mental health settings.",2014,,Psychiatric Services,65,5,648-653,,10.1176/appi.ps.201300176,,#3085,Watts 2014,"",""
Extracting antipsychotic polypharmacy data from electronic health records: Developing and evaluating a novel process,"Kadra, G.; Stewart, R.; Shetty, H.; Jackson, R.G.; Greenwood, M.A.; Roberts, A.; Chang, C.-K.; MacCabe, J.H.; Hayes, R.D.","Background: Antipsychotic prescription information is commonly derived from structured fields in clinical health records. However, utilising diverse and comprehensive sources of information is especially important when investigating less frequent patterns of medication prescribing such as antipsychotic polypharmacy (APP). This study describes and evaluates a novel method of extracting APP data from both structured and free-text fields in electronic health records (EHRs), and its use for research purposes. Methods: Using anonymised EHRs, we identified a cohort of patients with serious mental illness (SMI) who were treated in South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust mental health care services between 1 January and 30 June 2012. Information about antipsychotic co-prescribing was extracted using a combination of natural language processing and a bespoke algorithm. The validity of the data derived through this process was assessed against a manually coded gold standard to establish precision and recall. Lastly, we estimated the prevalence and patterns of antipsychotic polypharmacy. Results: Individual instances of antipsychotic prescribing were detected with high precision (0.94 to 0.97) and moderate recall (0.57-0.77). We detected baseline APP (two or more antipsychotics prescribed in any 6-week window) with 0.92 precision and 0.74 recall and long-term APP (antipsychotic co-prescribing for 6 months) with 0.94 precision and 0.60 recall. Of the 7,201 SMI patients receiving active care during the observation period, 338 (4.7 %; 95 % CI 4.2-5.2) were identified as receiving long-term APP. Two second generation antipsychotics (64.8 %); and first -second generation antipsychotics were most commonly co-prescribed (32.5 %). Conclusions: These results suggest that this is a potentially practical tool for identifying polypharmacy from mental health EHRs on a large scale. Furthermore, extracted data can be used to allow researchers to characterize patterns of polypharmacy over time including different drug combinations, trends in polypharmacy prescribing, predictors of polypharmacy prescribing and the impact of polypharmacy on patient outcomes. © 2015 Kadra et al.",2015,,BMC Psychiatry,15,1,,,10.1186/s12888-015-0557-z,,#3086,Kadra 2015,"",""

Methods/Analysis: 96 texts were used for the study which were randomly selected from a corpus of Russian students' essays ""Personality"". Using NLP methods frequencies of POS bigrams in each text (227 types of bigrams were overall identified) were computed, bigrams were then selected which are found in no less than 75% of the analyzed texts. Correlations between POS bigrams frequencies in texts and author gender and personality traits are computed. Findings: Some researchers report consistently positive contribution of POS n-grams in construction of models for personality prediction from text. But these conclusions were drawn based on the analysis of English-language texts. Our finding confirms the efficiency of POS bigrams in predicting personality from texts in Russian. Correlations of POS bigrams frequencies and characteristics of the authors of the texts (gender, personality traits measured with McCrae and Costa questionnaire) were computed. Gender was correlated with frequency of prep_noun bigram in the text, males typically score more on this parameter. For neuroticism the correlations were identified with adj-noun, noun-prep, prep-noun bigrams. There were also correlations with the Openness parameter and frequencies of noun-prep bigram. There were also weak correlations between the scores on Extraversion and frequencies of pers-vfin bigram, the scores on Agreeableness and frequencies of pers-vfin bigrams and ptcl-vfin bigrams. The paper points out that the resulting dependencies should be interpreted based on psychology, psycholinguistics and neurolinguistics data. Novelty of the study: To our knowledge, the current study has been the first one to deal with the frequencies of certain POS bigrams as parameters for written text author profiling for Russian-language texts.

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) clinical data repository affords an opportunity to apply text-mining methodology to study clinical questions in large populations. To assess the feasibility of text mining, investigation of the relationship between exposure to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and recorded diagnoses was conducted among all VA-treated Gulf war veterans, utilizing all progress notes recorded from 2000-2011. Text processing extracted ACE exposures recorded among 44.7 million clinical notes belonging to 243,973 veterans. The relationship of ACE exposure to adult illnesses was analyzed using logistic regression. Bias considerations were assessed. ACE score was strongly associated with suicide attempts and serious mental disorders (ORs = 1.84 to 1.97), and less so with behaviorally mediated and somatic conditions (ORs = 1.02 to 1.36) per unit.

The aim of this study was to develop an application to identify instances of Adverse Drug Events (ADEs) from free text psychiatric EHRs. Methods We used the GATE Natural Language Processing (NLP) software to mine instances of ADEs from free text content within the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) system, a de-identified psychiatric case register developed at the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, UK. The tool was built around a set of four movement disorders (extrapyramidal side effects [EPSEs]) related to antipsychotic therapy and rules were then generalised such that the tool could be applied to additional ADEs. We report the frequencies of recorded EPSEs in patients diagnosed with a Severe Mental Illness (SMI) and then report performance in identifying eight other unrelated ADEs. Results The tool identified EPSEs with >0.85 precision and >0.86 recall during testing. Akathisia was found to be the most prevalent EPSE overall and occurred in the Asian ethnic group with a frequency of 8.13%. The tool performed well when applied to most of the non-EPSEs but least well when applied to rare conditions such as myocarditis, a condition that appears frequently in the text as a side effect warning to patients. Conclusions The developed tool allows us to accurately identify instances of a potential ADE from psychiatric EHRs. As such, we were able to study the prevalence of ADEs within subgroups of patients stratified by SMI diagnosis, gender, age and ethnicity. In addition we demonstrated the generalisability of the application to other ADE types by producing a high precision rate on a non-EPSE related set of ADE containing documents.

Dream sentiment analysis using second order soft co-occurrences (SOSCO) and time course representations,"Razavi, A.H.; Matwin, S.; De Koninck, J.; Amini, R.R.","We describe a project undertaken by an interdisciplinary team combining researchers in sleep psychology and in Natural Language Processing/Machine Learning. The goal is sentiment analysis on a corpus containing short textual descriptions of dreams. Dreams are categorized in a four-level scale of positive and negative sentiments. We chose a four scale annotation to reflect the sentiment strength and simplicity at the same time. The approach is based on a novel representation, taking into account the leading themes of the dream and the sequential unfolding of associated sentiments during the dream. The dream representation is based on three combined parts, two of which are automatically produced from the description of the dream. The first part consists of co-occurrence vector representation of dreams in order to detect sentiment levels in the dream texts. Those vectors unlike the standard Bag-of-words model capture non-local relationships between meanings of word in a corpus. The second part introduces the dynamic representation that captures the sentimental changes throughout the progress of the dream. The third part is the self-reported assessment of the dream by the dreamer according to eight given attributes (self-assessment is different in many respects from the dream's sentiment classification). The three representations are subject to aggressive feature selection. Using an ensemble of classifiers on the combined 3-partite representation, the agreement between machine rating and the human judge scores on the four scales was 64 % which is in the range of human experts' consensus in that domain.

Purpose To determine if natural language processing (NLP) could be applied to information in the electronic health record (EHR) to automatically assess delivery of weight management-related counseling in clinical healthcare encounters. Methods The MediClass system with NLP capabilities was used to identify weight-management counseling in EHRs. Knowledge for the NLP application was derived from the 5As framework for behavior counseling: Ask (evaluate weight and related disease), Advise at-risk patients to lose weight, Assess patients' readiness to change behavior, Assist through discussion of weight-loss methods and programs, and Arrange follow-up efforts including referral.

Detecting causality from online psychiatric texts using inter-sentential language patterns,"Wu, J.-L.; Yu, L.-C.; Chang, P.-C.","Background: Online psychiatric texts are natural language texts expressing depressive problems, published by Internet users via community-based web services such as web forums, message boards and blogs. Understanding the cause-effect relations embedded in these psychiatric texts can provide insight into the authors problems, thus increasing the effectiveness of online psychiatric services. Methods: Previous studies have proposed the use of word pairs extracted from a set of sentence pairs to identify cause-effect relations between sentences. A word pair is made up of two words, with one coming from the cause text span and the other from the effect text span. Analysis of the relationship between these words can be used to capture individual word associations between cause and effect sentences. For instance, (broke up, life) and (boyfriend, meaningless) are two word pairs extracted from the sentence pair: I broke up with my boyfriend. Life is now meaningless to me. The major limitation of word pairs is that individual words in sentences usually cannot reflect the exact meaning of the cause and effect events, and thus may produce semantically incomplete word pairs, as the previous examples show. Therefore, this study proposes the use of inter-sentential language patterns such as ≫broke up, boyfriend<, >life, meaningless≪ to detect causality between sentences. The inter-sentential language patterns can capture associations among multiple words within and between sentences, thus can provide more precise information than word pairs. To acquire inter-sentential language patterns, we develop a text mining framework by extending the classical association rule mining algorithm such that it can discover frequently co-occurring patterns across the sentence boundary. Results: Performance was evaluated on a corpus of texts collected from PsychPark (http://www.psychpark. org), a virtual psychiatric clinic maintained by a group of volunteer professionals from the Taiwan Association of Mental Health Informatics. Experimental results show that the use of inter-sentential language patterns outperformed the use of word pairs proposed in previous studies. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the acquisition of inter-sentential language patterns for causality detection from online psychiatric texts. Such semantically more complete and precise features can improve causality detection performance. © 2012 Wu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2012,,BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making,12,1,,,10.1186/1472-6947-12-72,,#3106,Wu 2012,"",""

A proof of concept for assessing emergency room use with primary care data and natural language processing,"St-Maurice, J.; Kuo, M.-H.; Gooch, P.","Objective: The objective of this study was to undertake a proof of concept that demonstrated the use of primary care data and natural language processing and term extraction to assess emergency room use. The study extracted biopsychosocial concepts from primary care free text and related them to inappropriate emergency room use through the use of odds ratios. Methods: De-identified free text notes were extracted from a primary care clinic in Guelph, Ontario and analyzed with a software toolkit that incorporated General Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE) and MetaMap components for natural language processing and term extraction. Results: Over 10 million concepts were extracted from 13,836 patient records. Codes found in at least 1% percent of the sample were regressed against inappropriate emergency room use. 77 codes fell within the realm of biopsychosocial, were very statistically significant (p < 0.001) and had an OR > 2.0. Thematically, these codes involved mental health and pain related concepts. Conclusions: Analyzed thematically, mental health issues and pain are important themes; we have concluded that pain and mental health problems are primary drivers for inappropriate emergency room use.

However, such studies will require development of tools to define treatment outcome.Method Natural language processing (NLP) was applied to classify notes from 127 504 patients with a billing diagnosis of major depressive disorder, drawn from out-patient psychiatry practices affiliated with multiple, large New England hospitals. Classifications were compared with results using billing data (ICD-9 codes) alone and to a clinical gold standard based on chart review by a panel of senior clinicians. These cross-sectional classifications were then used to define longitudinal treatment outcomes, which were compared with a clinician-rated gold standard.Results Models incorporating NLP were superior to those relying on billing data alone for classifying current mood state (area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.85-0.88 v. 0.54-0.55).

Screening for posttraumatic stress disorder using verbal features in self narratives: A text mining approach,"He, Q.; Veldkamp, B.P.; de Vries, T.","Much evidence has shown that people's physical and mental health can be predicted by the words they use. However, such verbal information is seldom used in the screening and diagnosis process probably because the procedure to handle these words is rather difficult with traditional quantitative methods. The first challenge would be to extract robust information from diversified expression patterns, the second to transform unstructured text into a structuralized dataset. The present study developed a new textual assessment method to screen the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients using lexical features in the self narratives with text mining techniques. Using 300 self narratives collected online, we extracted highly discriminative keywords with the Chi-square algorithm and constructed a textual assessment model to classify individuals with the presence or absence of PTSD. This resulted in a high agreement between computer and psychiatrists' diagnoses for PTSD and revealed some expressive characteristics in the writings of PTSD patients. Although the results of text analysis are not completely analogous to the results of structured interviews in PTSD diagnosis, the application of text mining is a promising addition to assessing PTSD in clinical and research settings. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",2012,,Psychiatry Research,198,3,441-447,,10.1016/j.psychres.2012.01.032,,#3188,He 2012,"",""
Evaluation of Smoking Status Identification Using Electronic Health Records and Open-Text Information in a Large Mental Health Case Register,"Wu, C.-Y.; Chang, C.-K.; Robson, D.; Jackson, R.; Chen, S.-J.; Hayes, R.D.; Stewart, R.","Background:High smoking prevalence is a major public health concern for people with mental disorders. Improved monitoring could be facilitated through electronic health record (EHR) databases. We evaluated whether EHR information held in structured fields might be usefully supplemented by open-text information. The prevalence and correlates of EHR-derived current smoking in people with severe mental illness were also investigated.Methods:All cases had been referred to a secondary mental health service between 2008-2011 and received a diagnosis of schizophreniform or bipolar disorder. The study focused on those aged over 15 years who had received active care from the mental health service for at least a year (N=1,555). The 'CRIS-IE-Smoking' application used General Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE) natural language processing software to extract smoking status information from open-text fields. A combination of CRIS-IE-Smoking with data from structured fields was evaluated for coverage and the prevalence and demographic correlates of current smoking were analysed.Results:Proportions of patients with recorded smoking status increased from 11.6% to 64.0% through supplementing structured fields with CRIS-IE-Smoking data. The prevalence of current smoking was 59.6% in these 995 cases for whom this information was available. After adjustment, younger age (below 65 years), male sex, and non-cohabiting status were associated with current smoking status.Conclusions:A natural language processing application substantially improved routine EHR data on smoking status above structured fields alone and could thus be helpful in improving monitoring of this lifestyle behaviour.

Biomedical informatics techniques for processing and analyzing Web blogs of military service members,"Konovalov, S.; Scotch, M.; Post, L.; Brandt, C.","Introduction: Web logs (""blogs"") have become a popular mechanism for people to express their daily thoughts, feelings, and emotions. Many of these expressions contain health care-related themes, both physical and mental, similar to information discussed during a clinical interview or medical consultation. Thus, some of the information contained in blogs might be important for health care research, especially in mental health where stress-related conditions may be difficult and expensive to diagnose and where early recognition is often key to successful treatment. In the field of biomedical informatics, techniques such as information retrieval (IR) and natural language processing (NLP) are often used to unlock information contained in free-text notes. These methods might assist the clinical research community to better understand feelings and emotions post deployment and the burden of symptoms of stress among US military service members. Methods: In total, 90 military blog posts describing deployment situations and 60 control posts of Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) were collected. After ""stop"" word exclusion and stemming, a ""bag-of-words"" representation and term weighting was performed, and the most relevant words were manually selected out of the high-weight words. A pilot ontology was created using Collaborative Protégé, a knowledge management application. The word lists and the ontology were then used within General Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE), an NLP framework, to create an automated pipeline for recognition and analysis of blogs related to combat exposure. An independent expert opinion was used to create a reference standard and evaluate the results of the GATE pipeline. Results: The 2 dimensions of combat exposure descriptors identified were: words dealing with physical exposure and the soldiers' emotional reactions to it. GATE pipeline was able to retrieve blog texts describing combat exposure with precision 0.9, recall 0.75, and F-score 0.82.

Safety of Large Language Models in Addressing Depression.,Heston TF,"Background Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models, exemplified by systems such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Anthropic, are currently under intense investigation for their potential to address existing gaps in mental health support. One implementation of these large language models involves the development of mental health-focused conversational agents, which utilize pre-structured prompts to facilitate user interaction without requiring specialized knowledge in prompt engineering. However, uncertainties persist regarding the safety and efficacy of these agents in recognizing severe depression and suicidal tendencies. Given the well-established correlation between the severity of depression and the risk of suicide, improperly calibrated conversational agents may inadequately identify and respond to crises. Consequently, it is crucial to investigate whether publicly accessible repositories of mental health-focused conversational agents can consistently and safely address crisis scenarios before considering their adoption in clinical settings. This study assesses the safety of publicly available ChatGPT-3.5 conversational agents by evaluating their responses to a patient simulation indicating worsening depression and suicidality. Methodology This study evaluated ChatGPT-3.5 conversational agents on a publicly available repository specifically designed for mental health counseling. Each conversational agent was evaluated twice by a highly structured patient simulation. First, the simulation indicated escalating suicide risk based on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). For the second patient simulation, the escalating risk was presented in a more generalized manner not associated with an existing risk scale to assess the more generalized ability of the conversational agent to recognize suicidality. Each simulation recorded the exact point at which the conversational agent recommended human support. Then, the simulation continued until the conversational agent stopped entirely and shut down completely, insisting on human intervention. Results All 25 agents available on the public repository FlowGPT.com were evaluated. The point at which the conversational agents referred to a human occurred around the mid-point of the simulation, and definitive shutdown predominantly only happened at the highest risk levels. For the PHQ-9 simulation, the average initial referral and shutdown aligned with PHQ-9 scores of 12 (moderate depression) and 25 (severe depression). Few agents included crisis resources - only two referenced suicide hotlines. Despite the conversational agents insisting on human intervention, 22 out of 25 agents would eventually resume the dialogue if the simulation reverted to a lower risk level. Conclusions Current generative AI-based conversational agents are slow to escalate mental health risk scenarios, postponing referral to a human to potentially dangerous levels. More rigorous testing and oversight of conversational agents are needed before deployment in mental healthcare settings. Additionally, further investigation should explore if sustained engagement worsens outcomes and whether enhanced accessibility outweighs the risks of improper escalation.

The results show that the distribution of some Chinese speech users with depression is significantly different from that of other users. Emotional sadness, fear and disgust are more common in the depression class. For personal pronouns, negative words and interrogative words, there are also great differences between the two data sets. Using topic modeling, we found that patients mainly discussed seven topics: negative emotion fluctuation, disease treatment and somatic responses, sleep disorders, sense of worthlessness, suicidal extreme behavior, seeking emotional support and interpersonal communication. The depression class post negative polarity posts much more frequently than other users. The frequency and characteristics of posts also reveal certain characteristics, such as sleep problems and reduced self-disclosure. In this study, we used Chinese microblog data to conduct a detailed analysis of the users showing depression signs, which helps to identify more patients with depression.

Suicide Risk Assessments Through the Eyes of ChatGPT-3.5 Versus ChatGPT-4: Vignette Study.,Levkovich I; Elyoseph Z,"BACKGROUND: ChatGPT, a linguistic artificial intelligence (AI) model engineered by OpenAI, offers prospective contributions to mental health professionals. Although having significant theoretical implications, ChatGPT's practical capabilities, particularly regarding suicide prevention, have not yet been substantiated. OBJECTIVE: The study's aim was to evaluate ChatGPT's ability to assess suicide risk, taking into consideration 2 discernable factors-perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness-over a 2-month period. In addition, we evaluated whether ChatGPT-4 more accurately evaluated suicide risk than did ChatGPT-3.5. METHODS: ChatGPT was tasked with assessing a vignette that depicted a hypothetical patient exhibiting differing degrees of perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness. The assessments generated by ChatGPT were subsequently contrasted with standard evaluations rendered by mental health professionals. Using both ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4 (May 24, 2023), we executed 3 evaluative procedures in June and July 2023. Our intent was to scrutinize ChatGPT-4's proficiency in assessing various facets of suicide risk in relation to the evaluative abilities of both mental health professionals and an earlier version of ChatGPT-3.5 (March 14 version). RESULTS: During the period of June and July 2023, we found that the likelihood of suicide attempts as evaluated by ChatGPT-4 was similar to the norms of mental health professionals (n=379) under all conditions (average Z score of 0.01). Nonetheless, a pronounced discrepancy was observed regarding the assessments performed by ChatGPT-3.5 (May version), which markedly underestimated the potential for suicide attempts, in comparison to the assessments carried out by the mental health professionals (average Z score of -0.83). The empirical evidence suggests that ChatGPT-4's evaluation of the incidence of suicidal ideation and psychache was higher than that of the mental health professionals (average Z score of 0.47 and 1.00, respectively). Conversely, the level of resilience as assessed by both ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-3.5 (both versions) was observed to be lower in comparison to the assessments offered by mental health professionals (average Z score of -0.89 and -0.90, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that ChatGPT-4 estimates the likelihood of suicide attempts in a manner akin to evaluations provided by professionals. In terms of recognizing suicidal ideation, ChatGPT-4 appears to be more precise. However, regarding psychache, there was an observed overestimation by ChatGPT-4, indicating a need for further research. These results have implications regarding ChatGPT-4's potential to support gatekeepers, patients, and even mental health professionals' decision-making. Despite the clinical potential, intensive follow-up studies are necessary to establish the use of ChatGPT-4's capabilities in clinical practice. The finding that ChatGPT-3.5 frequently underestimates suicide risk, especially in severe cases, is particularly troubling. It indicates that ChatGPT may downplay one's actual suicide risk level.",2023,Sep,JMIR Ment Health,10,,e51232,,10.2196/51232,37728984,#3406,Levkovich 2023,"",""

Behavioral Activation and Depression Symptomatology: Longitudinal Assessment of Linguistic Indicators in Text-Based Therapy Sessions.,Burkhardt HA; Alexopoulos GS; Pullmann MD; Hull TD; Areán PA; Cohen T,"BACKGROUND: Behavioral activation (BA) is rooted in the behavioral theory of depression, which states that increased exposure to meaningful, rewarding activities is a critical factor in the treatment of depression. Assessing constructs relevant to BA currently requires the administration of standardized instruments, such as the Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale (BADS), which places a burden on patients and providers, among other potential limitations. Previous work has shown that depressed and nondepressed individuals may use language differently and that automated tools can detect these differences. The increasing use of online, chat-based mental health counseling presents an unparalleled resource for automated longitudinal linguistic analysis of patients with depression, with the potential to illuminate the role of reward exposure in recovery. OBJECTIVE: This work investigated how linguistic indicators of planning and participation in enjoyable activities identified in online, text-based counseling sessions relate to depression symptomatology over time. METHODS: Using distributional semantics methods applied to a large corpus of text-based online therapy sessions, we devised a set of novel BA-related categories for the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software package. We then analyzed the language used by 10,000 patients in online therapy chat logs for indicators of activation and other depression-related markers using LIWC. RESULTS: Despite their conceptual and operational differences, both previously established LIWC markers of depression and our novel linguistic indicators of activation were strongly associated with depression scores (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ]-9) and longitudinal patient trajectories. Emotional tone; pronoun rates; words related to sadness, health, and biology; and BA-related LIWC categories appear to be complementary, explaining more of the variance in the PHQ score together than they do independently. CONCLUSIONS: This study enables further work in automated diagnosis and assessment of depression, the refinement of BA psychotherapeutic strategies, and the development of predictive models for decision support.",2021,Jul,J Med Internet Res,23,7,e28244,,10.2196/28244,34259637,#3436,Burkhardt 2021,"",""

Depression in South Korean Adolescents Captured by Text and Opinion Mining of Social Big Data.,Song J; Song TM; Lee S; Seo DC,"Depression in adolescence is recognized as an important social and public health issue that interferes with continued physical growth and increases the likelihood of other mental disorders. The goal of this study was to examine online documents posted by South Korean adolescents for 3 years through the text and opinion mining of collectable documents in order to capture their depression. The sample for this study was online text-based individual documents that contained depression-related words among adolescents, and these were collected from 215 social media websites in South Korea from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2014. A sentiment lexicon was developed for adolescent depressive symptoms, and such sentiments were analyzed through opinion mining. The depressive symptoms in the present study were classified into nine categories as suggested by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5). The association analysis and decision tree analysis of data mining were used to build an efficient prediction model of adolescent depression. Opinion mining indicated that 15.5% were emotionally stable, 58.6% moderately stressed, and 25.9% highly distressed. Data mining revealed that the presence of depressed mood most of the day or nearly every day had the greatest effect on adolescents' depression.

Development and validation of MedDRA Tagger: a tool for extraction and structuring medical information from clinical notes.,Humbert-Droz M; Corley J; Tamang S; Gevaert O,"Rapid and automated extraction of clinical information from patients' notes is a desirable though difficult task. Natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning have great potential to automate and accelerate such applications, but developing such models can require a large amount of labeled clinical text, which can be a slow and laborious process. To address this gap, we propose the MedDRA tagger, a fast annotation tool that makes use of industrial level libraries such as spaCy, biomedical ontologies and weak supervision to annotate and extract clinical concepts at scale. The tool can be used to annotate clinical text and obtain labels for training machine learning models and further refine the clinical concept extraction performance, or to extract clinical concepts for observational study purposes. To demonstrate the usability and versatility of our tool, we present three different use cases: we use the tagger to determine patients with a primary brain cancer diagnosis, we show evidence of rising mental health symptoms at the population level and our last use case shows the evolution of COVID-19 symptomatology throughout three waves between February 2020 and October 2021. The validation of our tool showed good performance on both specific annotations from our development set (F1 score 0.81) and open source annotated data set (F1 score 0.79).

We subsequently relate our results to standardized individual-level measures. Participants (n = 1039) took part in the 'My Life with MS' study of the Swiss MS Registry which involved telling their story through self-selected life events using text descriptions and a semi-structured questionnaire. We performed topic modeling ('latent Dirichlet allocation') to identify high-level topics underlying the text descriptions. Using a pre-trained language model, we performed a fine-grained emotion analysis of the text descriptions. A topic modeling analysis of totally 4293 descriptions revealed eight underlying topics. Five topics are common in clinical research: 'diagnosis', 'medication/treatment', 'relapse/child', 'rehabilitation/wheelchair', and 'injection/symptoms'. However, three topics, 'work', 'birth/health', and 'partnership/MS' represent domains that are of great relevance for participants but are generally understudied in MS research. While emotions were predominantly negative (sadness, anxiety), emotions linked to the topics 'birth/health' and 'partnership/MS' was also positive (joy).

Topic modeling on clinical social work notes for exploring social determinants of health factors.,Sun S; Zack T; Williams CYK; Sushil M; Butte AJ,"OBJECTIVE: Existing research on social determinants of health (SDoH) predominantly focuses on physician notes and structured data within electronic medical records. This study posits that social work notes are an untapped, potentially rich source for SDoH information. We hypothesize that clinical notes recorded by social workers, whose role is to ameliorate social and economic factors, might provide a complementary information source of data on SDoH compared to physician notes, which primarily concentrate on medical diagnoses and treatments. We aimed to use word frequency analysis and topic modeling to identify prevalent terms and robust topics of discussion within a large cohort of social work notes including both outpatient and in-patient consultations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrieved a diverse, deidentified corpus of 0.95 million clinical social work notes from 181 644 patients at the University of California, San Francisco. We conducted word frequency analysis related to ICD-10 chapters to identify prevalent terms within the notes. We then applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling analysis to characterize this corpus and identify potential topics of discussion, which was further stratified by note types and disease groups. RESULTS: Word frequency analysis primarily identified medical-related terms associated with specific ICD10 chapters, though it also detected some subtle SDoH terms. In contrast, the LDA topic modeling analysis extracted 11 topics explicitly related to social determinants of health risk factors, such as financial status, abuse history, social support, risk of death, and mental health. The topic modeling approach effectively demonstrated variations between different types of social work notes and across patients with different types of diseases or conditions. DISCUSSION: Our findings highlight LDA topic modeling's effectiveness in extracting SDoH-related themes and capturing variations in social work notes, demonstrating its potential for informing targeted interventions for at-risk populations. CONCLUSION: Social work notes offer a wealth of unique and valuable information on an individual's SDoH. These notes present consistent and meaningful topics of discussion that can be effectively analyzed and utilized to improve patient care and inform targeted interventions for at-risk populations.",2024,Apr,JAMIA Open,7,1,ooad112,,10.1093/jamiaopen/ooad112,38223407,#3518,Sun 2024,"",""

Using General-purpose Sentiment Lexicons for Suicide Risk Assessment in Electronic Health Records: Corpus-Based Analysis.,Bittar A; Velupillai S; Roberts A; Dutta R,"BACKGROUND: Suicide is a serious public health issue, accounting for 1.4% of all deaths worldwide. Current risk assessment tools are reported as performing little better than chance in predicting suicide. New methods for studying dynamic features in electronic health records (EHRs) are being increasingly explored. One avenue of research involves using sentiment analysis to examine clinicians' subjective judgments when reporting on patients. Several recent studies have used general-purpose sentiment analysis tools to automatically identify negative and positive words within EHRs to test correlations between sentiment extracted from the texts and specific medical outcomes (eg, risk of suicide or in-hospital mortality). However, little attention has been paid to analyzing the specific words identified by general-purpose sentiment lexicons when applied to EHR corpora. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the coverage of six general-purpose sentiment lexicons against a corpus of EHR texts to ascertain the extent to which such lexical resources are fit for use in suicide risk assessment. METHODS: The data for this study were a corpus of 198,451 EHR texts made up of two subcorpora drawn from a 1:4 case-control study comparing clinical notes written over the period leading up to a suicide attempt (cases, n=2913) with those not preceding such an attempt (controls, n=14,727). We calculated word frequency distributions within each subcorpus to identify representative keywords for both the case and control subcorpora. We quantified the relative coverage of the 6 lexicons with respect to this list of representative keywords in terms of weighted precision, recall, and F score. RESULTS: The six lexicons achieved reasonable precision (0.53-0.68) but very low recall (0.04-0.36). Many of the most representative keywords in the suicide-related (case) subcorpus were not identified by any of the lexicons. The sentiment-bearing status of these keywords for this use case is thus doubtful.

ChatGPT in Answering Queries Related to Lifestyle-Related Diseases and Disorders.,Mondal H; Dash I; Mondal S; Behera JK,"Background Lifestyle-related diseases and disorders have become a significant global health burden. However, the majority of the population ignores or do not consult doctors for such disease or disorders. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT (GPT3.5) is capable of generating customized queries of a user. Hence, it can act as a virtual telehealth agent. Its capability to answer lifestyle-related diseases or disorders has not been explored. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of ChatGPT, an LLM, in providing answers to queries related to lifestyle-related diseases or disorders. Methods A set of 20 lifestyle-related disease or disorder cases covering a wide range of topics such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular health, and mental health were prepared with four questions. The case and questions were presented to ChatGPT and asked for the answers to those questions. Two physicians rated the content on a three-point Likert-like scale ranging from accurate (2), partially accurate (1), and inaccurate (0). Further, the content was rated as adequate (2), inadequate (1), and misguiding (0) for testing the applicability of the guides for patients. The readability of the text was analyzed by the Flesch-Kincaid Ease Score (FKES).  Results Among 20 cases, the average score of accuracy was 1.83±0.37 and guidance was 1.9±0.21.

Predicting Suicide Among US Veterans Using Natural Language Processing-enriched Social and Behavioral Determinants of Health.,Mitra A; Chen K; Liu W; Kessler RC; Yu H,"Despite recognizing the critical association between social and behavioral determinants of health (SBDH) and suicide risk, SBDHs from unstructured electronic health record (EHR) notes for suicide predictive modeling remain underutilized. This study investigates the impact of SBDH, identified from both structured and unstructured data utilizing a natural language processing (NLP) system, on suicide prediction within 7, 30, 90, and 180 days of discharge. Using EHR data of 2,987,006 Veterans between October 1, 2009, and September 30, 2015, from the US Veterans Health Administration (VHA), we designed a case-control study that demonstrates that incorporating structured and NLP-extracted SBDH significantly enhances the performance of three architecturally distinct suicide predictive models - elastic-net logistic regression, random forest (RF), and multilayer perceptron. For example, RF achieved notable improvements in suicide prediction within 180 days of discharge, with an increase in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve from 83.57-84.25% (95% CI = 0.63%-0.98%, p-val < 0.001) and the area under the precision recall curve from 57.38-59.87% (95% CI = 3.86%-4.82%, p-val < 0.001) after integrating NLP-extracted SBDH. These findings underscore the potential of NLP-extracted SBDH in enhancing suicide prediction across various prediction timeframes, offering valuable insights for healthcare practitioners and policymakers.",2024,Apr,Res Sq,,,,,10.21203/rs.3.rs-4290732/v1,38746180,#3552,Mitra 2024,"",""
A critical analysis of COVID-19 research literature: Text mining approach.,Zengul FD; Zengul AG; Mugavero MJ; Oner N; Ozaydin B; Delen D; Willig JH; Kennedy KC; Cimino J,"OBJECTIVE: Among the stakeholders of COVID-19 research, clinicians particularly experience difficulty keeping up with the deluge of SARS-CoV-2 literature while performing their much needed clinical duties. By revealing major topics, this study proposes a text-mining approach as an alternative to navigating large volumes of COVID-19 literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained 85,268 references from the NIH COVID-19 Portfolio as of November 21. After the exclusion based on inadequate abstracts, 65,262 articles remained in the final corpus. We utilized natural language processing to curate and generate the term list. We applied topic modeling analyses and multiple correspondence analyses to reveal the major topics and the associations among topics, journal countries, and publication sources. RESULTS: In our text mining analyses of NIH's COVID-19 Portfolio, we discovered two sets of eleven major research topics by analyzing abstracts and titles of the articles separately. The eleven major areas of COVID-19 research based on abstracts included the following topics: 1) Public Health, 2) Patient Care & Outcomes, 3) Epidemiologic Modeling, 4) Diagnosis and Complications, 5) Mechanism of Disease, 6) Health System Response, 7) Pandemic Control, 8) Protection/Prevention, 9) Mental/Behavioral Health, 10) Detection/Testing, 11) Treatment Options. Further analyses revealed that five (2,3,4,5, and 9) of the eleven abstract-based topics showed a significant correlation (ranked from moderate to weak) with title-based topics.

Identifying Supplement Use Within Clinical Notes: An Applicationof Natural Language Processing.,Sharma V; Sarkar IN,"Recent statistics indicate that the use of dietary supplements has increased over the years. Although being popular among consumers who use them for a variety of reasons, there have been limited clinical data-driven studies of the impact of dietary supplements on health outcomes. Challenges that impede such analyses in a comprehensive manner include either the sequestered nature of such data or their embedding within biomedical and clinical text. This study explored the feasibility to uncover patterns in the use of supplements, focusing on vitamin use among patients diagnosed with mental illness within patient records from the MIMIC-III database. The relevance of vitamin(s) was calculated at different levels of granularity and compared with association identified from Dietary Supplement Subset of MEDLINE.

Indirect Identification of Perinatal Psychosocial Risks from Natural Language.,Allen KC; Davis A; Krishnamurti T,"During the perinatal period, psychosocial health risks, including depression and intimate partner violence, are associated with serious adverse health outcomes for birth parents and children. To appropriately intervene, healthcare professionals must first identify those at risk, yet stigma often prevents people from directly disclosing the information needed to prompt an assessment. In this research we use short diary entries to indirectly elicit information that could indicate psychosocial risks, then examine patterns that emerge in the language of those at risk. We find that diary entries exhibit consistent themes, extracted using topic modeling, and emotional perspective, drawn from dictionary-informed sentiment features. Using these features, we use regularized regression to predict screening measures for depression and psychological aggression by an intimate partner. Journal text entries quantified through topic models and sentiment features show promise for depression prediction, corresponding with self-reported screening measures almost as well as closed-form questions. Text-based features are less useful in predicting intimate partner violence, but topic models generate themes that align with known risk correlates.

"Non-negative matrix factorization temporal topic models and clinical text data identify COVID-19 pandemic effects on primary healthcare and community health in Toronto, Canada.",Meaney C; Escobar M; Moineddin R; Stukel TA; Kalia S; Aliarzadeh B; Chen T; O'Neill B; Greiver M,"OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate how non-negative matrix factorization can be used to learn a temporal topic model over a large collection of primary care clinical notes, characterizing diverse COVID-19 pandemic effects on the physical/mental/social health of residents of Toronto, Canada. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study employs a retrospective open cohort design, consisting of 382,666 primary care progress notes from 44,828 patients, 54 physicians, and 12 clinics collected 01/01/2017 through 31/12/2020. Non-negative matrix factorization uncovers a meaningful latent topical structure permeating the corpus of primary care notes. The learned latent topical basis is transformed into a multivariate time series data structure. Time series methods and plots showcase the evolution/dynamics of learned topics over the study period and allow the identification of COVID-19 pandemic effects. We perform several post-hoc checks of model robustness to increase trust that descriptive/unsupervised inferences are stable over hyper-parameter configurations and/or data perturbations. RESULTS: Temporal topic modelling uncovers a myriad of pandemic-related effects from the expressive clinical text data. In terms of direct effects on patient-health, topics encoding respiratory disease symptoms display altered dynamics during the pandemic year. Further, the pandemic was associated with a multitude of indirect patient-level effects on topical domains representing mental health, sleep, social and familial dynamics, measurement of vitals/labs, uptake of prevention/screening maneuvers, and referrals to medical specialists. Finally, topic models capture changes in primary care practice patterns resulting from the pandemic, including changes in EMR documentation strategies and the uptake of telemedicine. CONCLUSION: Temporal topic modelling applied to a large corpus of rich primary care clinical text data, can identify a meaningful topical/thematic summarization which can provide policymakers and public health stakeholders a passive, cost-effective, technology for understanding holistic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the primary healthcare system and community/public-health.",2022,Apr,J Biomed Inform,128,,104034,,10.1016/j.jbi.2022.104034,35202844,#3573,Meaney 2022,"",""
Computational analyses identify addiction help-seeking behaviors on the social networking website Reddit: Insights into online social interactions and addiction support communities.,Valdez D; Patterson MS,"INTRODUCTION: Although social connection to others with lived addiction experiences is a strong predictor of long-term recovery from substance use disorders (SUD), the COVID-19 pandemic greatly altered global abilities to physically connect with other people. Evidence suggests online forums for people with SUD may serve as a sufficient proxy for social connection, however efficacy of online spaces as addiction treatment adjuncts remains empirically understudied. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to analyze a collection of Reddit posts germane to addiction and recovery collected between March-August 2022. METHODS: We collected (n = 9,066) Reddit posts (1) r/addiction; (2) r/DecidingToBeBetter, (3) r/SelfImprovement, (4) r/OpitatesRecovery, (5) r/StopSpeeding, (6) r/RedditorsInRecovery, and (7) r/StopSmoking subreddits. We applied several classes of natural language processing (NLP) methods to analyze and visualize our data including term frequency inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) calculations, k-means clustering, and principal components analysis (PCA). We also applied a Valence Aware Dictional and sEntiment [sic] Reasoner (VADER) sentiment analysis to determine affect in our data. RESULTS: Our analyses revealed three distinct clusters: (1) Personal addiction struggle, or sharing one's recovery journey (n = 2,520), (2) Giving advice, or offering counseling based on first-hand experiences (n = 3,885), and (3) Seeking advice, or asking for support or advice related to addiction (n = 2,661).

Measuring Adoption of Patient Priorities-Aligned Care Using Natural Language Processing of Electronic Health Records: Development and Validation of the Model.,Razjouyan J; Freytag J; Dindo L; Kiefer L; Odom E; Halaszynski J; Silva JW; Naik AD,"BACKGROUND: Patient Priorities Care (PPC) is a model of care that aligns health care recommendations with priorities of older adults who have multiple chronic conditions. Following identification of patient priorities, this information is documented in the patient's electronic health record (EHR). OBJECTIVE: Our goal is to develop and validate a natural language processing (NLP) model that reliably documents when clinicians identify patient priorities (ie, values, outcome goals, and care preferences) within the EHR as a measure of PPC adoption. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of unstructured National Veteran Health Administration EHR free-text notes using an NLP model. The data were sourced from 778 patient notes of 658 patients from encounters with 144 social workers in the primary care setting. Each patient's free-text clinical note was reviewed by 2 independent reviewers for the presence of PPC language such as priorities, values, and goals. We developed an NLP model that utilized statistical machine learning approaches. The performance of the NLP model in training and validation with 10-fold cross-validation is reported via accuracy, recall, and precision in comparison to the chart review. RESULTS: Of 778 notes, 589 (75.7%) were identified as containing PPC language (kappa=0.82, P<.001). The NLP model in the training stage had an accuracy of 0.98 (95% CI 0.98-0.99), a recall of 0.98 (95% CI 0.98-0.99), and precision of 0.98 (95% CI 0.97-1.00). The NLP model in the validation stage had an accuracy of 0.92 (95% CI 0.90-0.94), recall of 0.84 (95% CI 0.79-0.89), and precision of 0.84 (95% CI 0.77-0.91). In contrast, an approach using simple search terms for PPC only had a precision of 0.757.

We employ two distinct large-margin models capable of handling multiple labels. The first uses one classifier per emotion, and is built to simplify label balance issues and to allow extremely fast development. This approach is very effective, scoring an F-measure of 55.22 and placing fourth in the competition, making it the best system that does not use web-derived statistics or re-annotated training data.

"Utilizing Text Mining, Data Linkage and Deep Learning in Police and Health Records to Predict Future Offenses in Family and Domestic Violence.",Karystianis G; Cabral RC; Han SC; Poon J; Butler T,"Family and Domestic violence (FDV) is a global problem with significant social, economic, and health consequences for victims including increased health care costs, mental trauma, and social stigmatization. In Australia, the estimated annual cost of FDV is $22 billion, with one woman being murdered by a current or former partner every week. Despite this, tools that can predict future FDV based on the features of the person of interest (POI) and victim are lacking. The New South Wales Police Force attends thousands of FDV events each year and records details as fixed fields (e.g., demographic information for individuals involved in the event) and as text narratives which describe abuse types, victim injuries, threats, including the mental health status for POIs and victims. This information within the narratives is mostly untapped for research and reporting purposes. After applying a text mining methodology to extract information from 492,393 FDV event narratives (abuse types, victim injuries, mental illness mentions), we linked these characteristics with the respective fixed fields and with actual mental health diagnoses obtained from the NSW Ministry of Health for the same cohort to form a comprehensive FDV dataset. These data were input into five deep learning models (MLP, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, Bi-GRU, BERT) to predict three FDV offense types (""hands-on,"" ""hands-off,"" ""Apprehended Domestic Violence Order (ADVO) breach""). The transformer model with BERT embeddings returned the best performance (69.00% accuracy; 66.76% ROC) for ""ADVO breach"" in a multilabel classification setup while the binary classification setup generated similar results. ""Hands-off"" offenses proved the hardest offense type to predict (60.72% accuracy; 57.86% ROC using BERT) but showed potential to improve with fine-tuning of binary classification setups. ""Hands-on"" offenses benefitted least from the contextual information gained through BERT embeddings in which MLP with categorical embeddings outperformed it in three out of four metrics (65.95% accuracy; 78.03% F1-score; 70.00% precision).

Detecting depression of Chinese microblog users via text analysis: Combining Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC) with culture and suicide related lexicons.,Lyu S; Ren X; Du Y; Zhao N,"INTRODUCTION: In recent years, research has used psycholinguistic features in public discourse, networking behaviors on social media and profile information to train models for depression detection. However, the most widely adopted approach for the extraction of psycholinguistic features is to use the Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC) dictionary and various affective lexicons. Other features related to cultural factors and suicide risk have not been explored. Moreover, the use of social networking behavioral features and profile features would limit the generalizability of the model. Therefore, our study aimed at building a prediction model of depression for text-only social media data through a wider range of possible linguistic features related to depression, and illuminate the relationship between linguistic expression and depression. METHODS: We collected 789 users' depression scores as well as their past posts on Weibo, and extracted a total of 117 lexical features via Simplified Chinese Linguistic Inquiry Word Count, Chinese Suicide Dictionary, Chinese Version of Moral Foundations Dictionary, Chinese Version of Moral Motivation Dictionary, and Chinese Individualism/Collectivism Dictionary. RESULTS: Results showed that all the dictionaries contributed to the prediction. The best performing model occurred with linear regression, with the Pearson correlation coefficient between predicted values and self-reported values was 0.33, the R-squared was 0.10, and the split-half reliability was 0.75. DISCUSSION: This study did not only develop a predictive model applicable to text-only social media data, but also demonstrated the importance taking cultural psychological factors and suicide related expressions into consideration in the calculation of word frequency.

Enabling Early Health Care Intervention by Detecting Depression in Users of Web-Based Forums using Language Models: Longitudinal Analysis and Evaluation.,Owen D; Antypas D; Hassoulas A; Pardiñas AF; Espinosa-Anke L; Collados JC,"BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder is a common mental disorder affecting 5% of adults worldwide. Early contact with health care services is critical for achieving accurate diagnosis and improving patient outcomes. Key symptoms of major depressive disorder (depression hereafter) such as cognitive distortions are observed in verbal communication, which can also manifest in the structure of written language. Thus, the automatic analysis of text outputs may provide opportunities for early intervention in settings where written communication is rich and regular, such as social media and web-based forums. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was 2-fold. We sought to gauge the effectiveness of different machine learning approaches to identify users of the mass web-based forum Reddit, who eventually disclose a diagnosis of depression. We then aimed to determine whether the time between a forum post and a depression diagnosis date was a relevant factor in performing this detection. METHODS: A total of 2 Reddit data sets containing posts belonging to users with and without a history of depression diagnosis were obtained. The intersection of these data sets provided users with an estimated date of depression diagnosis. This derived data set was used as an input for several machine learning classifiers, including transformer-based language models (LMs). RESULTS: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and MentalBERT transformer-based LMs proved the most effective in distinguishing forum users with a known depression diagnosis from those without. They each obtained a mean F(1)-score of 0.64 across the experimental setups used for binary classification. The results also suggested that the final 12 to 16 weeks (about 3-4 months) of posts before a depressed user's estimated diagnosis date are the most indicative of their illness, with data before that period not helping the models detect more accurately. Furthermore, in the 4- to 8-week period before the user's estimated diagnosis date, their posts exhibited more negative sentiment than any other 4-week period in their post history. CONCLUSIONS: Transformer-based LMs may be used on data from web-based social media forums to identify users at risk for psychiatric conditions such as depression. Language features picked up by these classifiers might predate depression onset by weeks to months, enabling proactive mental health care interventions to support those at risk for this condition.",2023,Mar,JMIR AI,2,,e41205,,10.2196/41205,37525646,#3640,Owen 2023,"",""
"Identifying Psychosis Episodes in Psychiatric Admission Notes via Rule-based Methods, Machine Learning, and Pre-Trained Language Models.",Hua Y; Blackley SV; Shinn AK; Skinner JP; Moran LV; Zhou L,"Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and improved outcomes, yet identifying psychotic episodes presents significant challenges due to its complex nature and the varied presentation of symptoms among individuals. One of the primary difficulties lies in the underreporting and underdiagnosis of psychosis, compounded by the stigma surrounding mental health and the individuals' often diminished insight into their condition. Existing efforts leveraging Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to retrospectively identify psychosis typically rely on structured data, such as medical codes and patient demographics, which frequently lack essential information. Addressing these challenges, our study leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to analyze psychiatric admission notes for the diagnosis of psychosis, providing a detailed evaluation of rule-based algorithms, machine learning models, and pre-trained language models. Additionally, the study investigates the effectiveness of employing keywords to streamline extensive note data before training and evaluating the models. Analyzing 4,617 initial psychiatric admission notes (1,196 cases of psychosis versus 3,433 controls) from 2005 to 2019, we discovered that the XGBoost classifier employing Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) features derived from notes pre-selected by expert-curated keywords, attained the highest performance with an F1 score of 0.8881 (AUROC [95% CI]: 0.9725 [0.9717, 0.9733]). BlueBERT demonstrated comparable efficacy an F1 score of 0.8841 (AUROC [95% CI]: 0.97 [0.9580, 0.9820]) on the same set of notes. Both models markedly outperformed traditional International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code-based detection methods from discharge summaries, which had an F1 score of 0.7608, thus improving the margin by 0.12. Furthermore, our findings indicate that keyword pre-selection markedly enhances the performance of both machine learning and pre-trained language models. This study illustrates the potential of NLP techniques to improve psychosis detection within admission notes and aims to serve as a foundational reference for future research on applying NLP for psychosis identification in EHR notes.",2024,Mar,medRxiv,,,,,10.1101/2024.03.18.24304475,38562701,#3652,Hua 2024,"",""

In responses about risk factors, individuals frequently mentioned generic terms like ""illness"" while organizations mentioned specific terms like ""traumatic brain injury."" Organizations and individuals described unique barriers to care and emphasized ways to integrate data and research to improve points of care. Organizations often identified lack of funding as barriers while individuals often identified key moments for prevention such as military transitions and ensuring care providers have military cultural understanding. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an example of a rapid, adaptive analysis of a large body of qualitative, public response data about veteran suicide to support a federal strategy for an important public health topic. Combining qualitative and text-mining methods allowed a representation of voices and perspectives including the lived experiences of individuals who described stories of military transition, treatments that worked or did not, and the perspective of organizations treating veterans for suicide. The results supported the development of a national strategy to reduce suicide risks for veterans as well as civilians.",2022,Jun,Health Serv Res,57 Suppl 1,Suppl 1,32-41,,10.1111/1475-6773.13931,35238027,#3654,Kalvesmaki 2022,"",""
Enhancing post-traumatic stress disorder patient assessment: leveraging natural language processing for research of domain criteria identification using electronic medical records.,Miranda O; Kiehl SM; Qi X; Brannock MD; Kosten T; Ryan ND; Kirisci L; Wang Y; Wang L,"BACKGROUND: Extracting research of domain criteria (RDoC) from high-risk populations like those with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is crucial for positive mental health improvements and policy enhancements. The intricacies of collecting, integrating, and effectively leveraging clinical notes for this purpose introduce complexities. METHODS: In our study, we created a natural language processing (NLP) workflow to analyze electronic medical record (EMR) data and identify and extract research of domain criteria using a pre-trained transformer-based natural language model, all-mpnet-base-v2. We subsequently built dictionaries from 100,000 clinical notes and analyzed 5.67 million clinical notes from 38,807 PTSD patients from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Subsequently, we showcased the significance of our approach by extracting and visualizing RDoC information in two use cases: (i) across multiple patient populations and (ii) throughout various disease trajectories. RESULTS: The sentence transformer model demonstrated high F1 macro scores across all RDoC domains, achieving the highest performance with a cosine similarity threshold value of 0.3. This ensured an F1 score of at least 80% across all RDoC domains. The study revealed consistent reductions in all six RDoC domains among PTSD patients after psychotherapy. We found that 60.6% of PTSD women have at least one abnormal instance of the six RDoC domains as compared to PTSD men (51.3%), with 45.1% of PTSD women with higher levels of sensorimotor disturbances compared to men (41.3%). We also found that 57.3% of PTSD patients have at least one abnormal instance of the six RDoC domains based on our records. Also, veterans had the higher abnormalities of negative and positive valence systems (60% and 51.9% of veterans respectively) compared to non-veterans (59.1% and 49.2% respectively). The domains following first diagnoses of PTSD were associated with heightened cue reactivity to trauma, suicide, alcohol, and substance consumption.

Text-mining as a methodology to assess eating disorder-relevant factors: Comparing mentions of fitness tracking technology across online communities.,McCaig D; Bhatia S; Elliott MT; Walasek L; Meyer C,"OBJECTIVE: Text-mining offers a technique to identify and extract information from a large corpus of textual data. As an example, this study presents the application of text-mining to assess and compare interest in fitness tracking technology across eating disorder and health-related online communities. METHOD: A list of fitness tracking technology terms was developed, and communities (i.e., 'subreddits') on a large online discussion platform (Reddit) were compared regarding the frequency with which these terms occurred. The corpus used in this study comprised all comments posted between May 2015 and January 2018 (inclusive) on six subreddits-three eating disorder-related, and three relating to either fitness, weight-management, or nutrition. All comments relating to the same 'thread' (i.e., conversation) were concatenated, and formed the cases used in this study (N = 377,276). RESULTS: Within the eating disorder-related subreddits, the findings indicated that a 'pro-eating disorder' subreddit, which is less recovery focused than the other eating disorder subreddits, had the highest frequency of fitness tracker terms. Across all subreddits, the weight-management subreddit had the highest frequency of the fitness tracker terms' occurrence, and MyFitnessPal was the most frequently mentioned fitness tracker. DISCUSSION: The technique exemplified here can potentially be used to assess group differences to identify at-risk populations, generate and explore clinically relevant research questions in populations who are difficult to recruit, and scope an area for which there is little extant literature. The technique also facilitates methodological triangulation of research findings obtained through more 'traditional' techniques, such as surveys or interviews.",2018,Jul,Int J Eat Disord,51,7,647-655,,10.1002/eat.22882,29734478,#3688,McCaig 2018,"",""

Identifying and Predicting Intentional Self-Harm in Electronic Health Record Clinical Notes: Deep Learning Approach.,Obeid JS; Dahne J; Christensen S; Howard S; Crawford T; Frey LJ; Stecker T; Bunnell BE,"BACKGROUND: Suicide is an important public health concern in the United States and around the world. There has been significant work examining machine learning approaches to identify and predict intentional self-harm and suicide using existing data sets. With recent advances in computing, deep learning applications in health care are gaining momentum. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to leverage the information in clinical notes using deep neural networks (DNNs) to (1) improve the identification of patients treated for intentional self-harm and (2) predict future self-harm events. METHODS: We extracted clinical text notes from electronic health records (EHRs) of 835 patients with International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for intentional self-harm and 1670 matched controls who never had any intentional self-harm ICD codes. The data were divided into training and holdout test sets. We tested a number of algorithms on clinical notes associated with the intentional self-harm codes using the training set, including several traditional bag-of-words-based models and 2 DNN models: a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a long short-term memory model. We also evaluated the predictive performance of the DNNs on a subset of patients who had clinical notes 1 to 6 months before the first intentional self-harm event. Finally, we evaluated the impact of a pretrained model using Word2vec (W2V) on performance. RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the CNN on the phenotyping task, that is, the detection of intentional self-harm in clinical notes concurrent with the events was 0.999, with an F1 score of 0.985. In the predictive task, the CNN achieved the highest performance with an AUC of 0.882 and an F1 score of 0.769. Although pretraining with W2V shortened the DNN training time, it did not improve performance. CONCLUSIONS: The strong performance on the first task, namely, phenotyping based on clinical notes, suggests that such models could be used effectively for surveillance of intentional self-harm in clinical text in an EHR. The modest performance on the predictive task notwithstanding, the results using DNN models on clinical text alone are competitive with other reports in the literature using risk factors from structured EHR data.",2020,Jul,JMIR Med Inform,8,7,e17784,,10.2196/17784,32729840,#3697,Obeid 2020,"",""

We developed a methodology to capture 2 rare and severe social determinants of health, homelessness and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), from a large EHR repository. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We first constructed lexicons to capture homelessness and ACE phenotypic profiles. We employed word2vec and lexical associations to mine homelessness-related words. Next, using relevance feedback, we refined the 2 profiles with iterative searches over 100 million notes from the Vanderbilt EHR. Seven assessors manually reviewed the top-ranked results of 2544 patient visits relevant for homelessness and 1000 patients relevant for ACE. RESULTS: word2vec yielded better performance (area under the precision-recall curve [AUPRC] of 0.94) than lexical associations (AUPRC = 0.83) for extracting homelessness-related words. A comparative study of searches for the 2 phenotypes revealed a higher performance achieved for homelessness (AUPRC = 0.95) than ACE (AUPRC = 0.79).

Detection of Personal and Family History of Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors using Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing: A Multi-Site Study.,Adekkanattu P; Furmanchuk A; Wu Y; Pathak A; Patra BG; Bost S; Morrow D; Wang GH; Yang Y; Forrest NJ; Luo Y; Walunas TL; Jenny WL; Gelad W; Bian J; Bao Y; Weiner M; Oslin D; Pathak J,"OBJECTIVE: Personal and family history of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (PSH and FSH, respectively) are significant risk factors associated with future suicide events. These are often captured in narrative clinical notes in electronic health records (EHRs). Collaboratively, Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM), Northwestern Medicine (NM), and the University of Florida (UF) developed and validated deep learning (DL)-based natural language processing (NLP) tools to detect PSH and FSH from such notes. The tool's performance was further benchmarked against a method relying exclusively on ICD-9/10 diagnosis codes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed DL-based NLP tools utilizing pre-trained transformer models Bio_ClinicalBERT and GatorTron, and compared them with expert-informed, rule-based methods. The tools were initially developed and validated using manually annotated clinical notes at WCM. Their portability and performance were further evaluated using clinical notes at NM and UF. RESULTS: The DL tools outperformed the rule-based NLP tool in identifying PSH and FHS. For detecting PSH, the rule-based system obtained an F1-score of 0.75 ± 0.07, while the Bio_ClinicalBERT and GatorTron DL tools scored 0.83 ± 0.09 and 0.84 ± 0.07, respectively. For detecting FSH, the rule-based NLP tool's F1-score was 0.69 ± 0.11, compared to 0.89 ± 0.10 for Bio_ClinicalBERT and 0.92 ± 0.07 for GatorTron. For the gold standard corpora across the three sites, only 2.2% (WCM), 9.3% (NM), and 7.8% (UF) of patients reported to have an ICD-9/10 diagnosis code for suicidal thoughts and behaviors prior to the clinical notes report date. The best performing GatorTron DL tool identified 93.0% (WCM), 80.4% (NM), and 89.0% (UF) of patients with documented PSH, and 85.0%(WCM), 89.5%(NM), and 100%(UF) of patients with documented FSH in their notes. DISCUSSION: While PSH and FSH are significant risk factors for future suicide events, little effort has been made previously to identify individuals with these history. To address this, we developed a transformer based DL method and compared with conventional rule-based NLP approach. The varying effectiveness of the rule-based tools across sites suggests a need for improvement in its dictionary-based approach. In contrast, the performances of the DL tools were higher and comparable across sites. Furthermore, DL tools were fine-tuned using only small number of annotated notes at each site, underscores its greater adaptability to local documentation practices and lexical variations. CONCLUSION: Variations in local documentation practices across health care systems pose challenges to rule-based NLP tools. In contrast, the developed DL tools can effectively extract PSH and FSH information from unstructured clinical notes. These tools will provide clinicians with crucial information for assessing and treating patients at elevated risk for suicide who are rarely been diagnosed.",2024,Mar,Res Sq,,,,,10.21203/rs.3.rs-4014472/v1,38559051,#3714,Adekkanattu 2024,"",""
Comparison of Methods for Estimating Temporal Topic Models From Primary Care Clinical Text Data: Retrospective Closed Cohort Study.,Meaney C; Escobar M; Stukel TA; Austin PC; Jaakkimainen L,"BACKGROUND: Health care organizations are collecting increasing volumes of clinical text data. Topic models are a class of unsupervised machine learning algorithms for discovering latent thematic patterns in these large unstructured document collections. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to comparatively evaluate several methods for estimating temporal topic models using clinical notes obtained from primary care electronic medical records from Ontario, Canada. METHODS: We used a retrospective closed cohort design. The study spanned from January 01, 2011, through December 31, 2015, discretized into 20 quarterly periods. Patients were included in the study if they generated at least 1 primary care clinical note in each of the 20 quarterly periods. These patients represented a unique cohort of individuals engaging in high-frequency use of the primary care system. The following temporal topic modeling algorithms were fitted to the clinical note corpus: nonnegative matrix factorization, latent Dirichlet allocation, the structural topic model, and the BERTopic model. RESULTS: Temporal topic models consistently identified latent topical patterns in the clinical note corpus. The learned topical bases identified meaningful activities conducted by the primary health care system. Latent topics displaying near-constant temporal dynamics were consistently estimated across models (eg, pain, hypertension, diabetes, sleep, mood, anxiety, and depression). Several topics displayed predictable seasonal patterns over the study period (eg, respiratory disease and influenza immunization programs). CONCLUSIONS: Nonnegative matrix factorization, latent Dirichlet allocation, structural topic model, and BERTopic are based on different underlying statistical frameworks (eg, linear algebra and optimization, Bayesian graphical models, and neural embeddings), require tuning unique hyperparameters (optimizers, priors, etc), and have distinct computational requirements (data structures, computational hardware, etc). Despite the heterogeneity in statistical methodology, the learned latent topical summarizations and their temporal evolution over the study period were consistently estimated. Temporal topic models represent an interesting class of models for characterizing and monitoring the primary health care system.",2022,Dec,JMIR Med Inform,10,12,e40102,,10.2196/40102,36534443,#3718,Meaney 2022,"",""

A Fresh Perspective on Examining Population Emotional Well-Being Trends by Internet Search Engine: An Emerging Composite Anxiety and Depression Index.,Wang Y; Deng H; Gao S; Li T; Wang F,"Traditional assessments of anxiety and depression face challenges and difficulties when it comes to understanding trends in-group psychological characteristics. As people become more accustomed to expressing their opinions online, location-based online media and cutting-edge algorithms offer new opportunities to identify associations between group sentiment and economic- or healthcare-related variables. Our research provides a novel approach to analyzing emotional well-being trends in a population by focusing on retrieving online information. We used emotionally enriched texts on social media to build the Public Opinion Dictionary (POD). Then, combining POD with the word vector model and search trend, we developed the Composite Anxiety and Depression Index (CADI), which can reflect the mental health level of a region during a specific time period. We utilized the representative external data by CHARLS to validate the effectiveness of CADI, indicating that CADI can serve as a representative indicator of the prevalence of mental disorders. Regression and subgroup analysis are employed to further elucidate the association between public mental health (measured by CADI) with economic development and medical burden. The results of comprehensive regression analysis show that the Import-Export index (-16.272, p < 0.001) and average cost of patients (4.412, p < 0.001) were significantly negatively associated with the CADI, and the sub-models stratificated by GDP showed the same situation. Disposable income (-28.389, p < 0.001) became significant in the subgroup with lower GDP, while the rate of unemployment (2.399, p < 0.001) became significant in the higher subgroup.

Analyzing EHR data from 13,607 patients diagnosed with MDD over 15 years, we identified 1,610 cases of conversion to BD. Using a multivariate Cox regression model, we identified severity of the initial MDD episode, the presence of psychosis and hospitalization at first episode, family history of mood or psychotic disorders, female gender to be predictive of the conversion to BD. Additionally, we observed associations with medication classes (prescriptions of mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and antidepressants) and clinical features (delusions, suicide attempt, suicidal ideation, use of marijuana and alcohol use/abuse) derived from natural language processing (NLP) of clinical notes. Together, these risk factors predicted BD conversion within five years of the initial MDD diagnosis, with a recall of 72% and a precision of 38%. Our study confirms many previously identified risk factors identified through registry-based studies (such as female gender and psychotic depression at the index MDD episode), and identifies novel ones (specifically, suicidal ideation and suicide attempt extracted from clinical notes).

"A multimodal dialog approach to mental state characterization in clinically depressed, anxious, and suicidal populations.",Cohen J; Richter V; Neumann M; Black D; Haq A; Wright-Berryman J; Ramanarayanan V,"BACKGROUND: The rise of depression, anxiety, and suicide rates has led to increased demand for telemedicine-based mental health screening and remote patient monitoring (RPM) solutions to alleviate the burden on, and enhance the efficiency of, mental health practitioners. Multimodal dialog systems (MDS) that conduct on-demand, structured interviews offer a scalable and cost-effective solution to address this need. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the feasibility of a cloud based MDS agent, Tina, for mental state characterization in participants with depression, anxiety, and suicide risk. METHOD: Sixty-eight participants were recruited through an online health registry and completed 73 sessions, with 15 (20.6%), 21 (28.8%), and 26 (35.6%) sessions screening positive for depression, anxiety, and suicide risk, respectively using conventional screening instruments. Participants then interacted with Tina as they completed a structured interview designed to elicit calibrated, open-ended responses regarding the participants' feelings and emotional state. Simultaneously, the platform streamed their speech and video recordings in real-time to a HIPAA-compliant cloud server, to compute speech, language, and facial movement-based biomarkers. After their sessions, participants completed user experience surveys. Machine learning models were developed using extracted features and evaluated with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: For both depression and suicide risk, affected individuals tended to have a higher percent pause time, while those positive for anxiety showed reduced lip movement relative to healthy controls. In terms of single-modality classification models, speech features performed best for depression (AUC = 0.64; 95% CI = 0.51-0.78), facial features for anxiety (AUC = 0.57; 95% CI = 0.43-0.71), and text features for suicide risk (AUC = 0.65; 95% CI = 0.52-0.78). Best overall performance was achieved by decision fusion of all models in identifying suicide risk (AUC = 0.76; 95% CI = 0.65-0.87). Participants reported the experience comfortable and shared their feelings. CONCLUSION: MDS is a feasible, useful, effective, and interpretable solution for RPM in real-world clinical depression, anxiety, and suicidal populations.

The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5; cutoff 31) was used to assess CB-PTSD. By developing an ML model that utilizes numerical vector representation of the ADA model, we identify CB-PTSD via narrative classification. Our model outperformed (F1 score: 0.82) ChatGPT and six previously published large language models (LLMs) trained on mental health or clinical domains data, suggesting that the ADA model can be harnessed to identify CB-PTSD. Our modeling approach could be generalized to assess other mental health disorders.",2024,Feb,Res Sq,,,,,10.21203/rs.3.rs-3428787/v2,37886525,#3761,Bartal 2024,"",""
The PSYchiatric clinical outcome prediction (PSYCOP) cohort: leveraging the potential of electronic health records in the treatment of mental disorders.,Hansen L; Enevoldsen KC; Bernstorff M; Nielbo KL; Danielsen AA; Østergaard SD,"BACKGROUND: The quality of life and lifespan are greatly reduced among individuals with mental illness. To improve prognosis, the nascent field of precision psychiatry aims to provide personalised predictions for the course of illness and response to treatment. Unfortunately, the results of precision psychiatry studies are rarely externally validated, almost never implemented in clinical practice, and tend to focus on a few selected outcomes. To overcome these challenges, we have established the PSYchiatric Clinical Outcome Prediction (PSYCOP) cohort, which will form the basis for extensive studies in the upcoming years. METHODS: PSYCOP is a retrospective cohort study that includes all patients with at least one contact with the psychiatric services of the Central Denmark Region in the period from January 1, 2011, to October 28, 2020 (n = 119 291). All data from the electronic health records (EHR) are included, spanning diagnoses, information on treatments, clinical notes, discharge summaries, laboratory tests, etc. Based on these data, machine learning methods will be used to make prediction models for a range of clinical outcomes, such as diagnostic shifts, treatment response, medical comorbidity, and premature mortality, with an explicit focus on clinical feasibility and implementation. DISCUSSIONS: We expect that studies based on the PSYCOP cohort will advance the field of precision psychiatry through the use of state-of-the-art machine learning methods on a large and representative data set. Implementation of prediction models in clinical psychiatry will likely improve treatment and, hopefully, increase the quality of life and lifespan of those with mental illness.",2021,Dec,Acta Neuropsychiatr,33,6,323-330,,10.1017/neu.2021.22,34369330,#3768,Hansen 2021,"",""
"Predicting mental conditions based on ""history of present illness"" in psychiatric notes with deep neural networks.",Tran T; Kavuluru R,"BACKGROUND: Applications of natural language processing to mental health notes are not common given the sensitive nature of the associated narratives. The CEGS N-GRID 2016 Shared Task in Clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) changed this scenario by providing the first set of neuropsychiatric notes to participants. This study summarizes our efforts and results in proposing a novel data use case for this dataset as part of the third track in this shared task. OBJECTIVE: We explore the feasibility and effectiveness of predicting a set of common mental conditions a patient has based on the short textual description of patient's history of present illness typically occurring in the beginning of a psychiatric initial evaluation note. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We clean and process the 1000 records made available through the N-GRID clinical NLP task into a key-value dictionary and build a dataset of 986 examples for which there is a narrative for history of present illness as well as Yes/No responses with regards to presence of specific mental conditions. We propose two independent deep neural network models: one based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and another based on recurrent neural networks with hierarchical attention (ReHAN), the latter of which allows for interpretation of model decisions. We conduct experiments to compare these methods to each other and to baselines based on linear models and named entity recognition (NER). RESULTS: Our CNN model with optimized thresholding of output probability estimates achieves best overall mean micro-F score of 63.144% for 11 common mental conditions with statistically significant gains (p<0.05) over all other models. The ReHAN model with interpretable attention mechanism scored 61.904% mean micro-F1 score. Both models' improvements over baseline models (support vector machines and NER) are statistically significant. The ReHAN model additionally aids in interpretation of the results by surfacing important words and sentences that lead to a particular prediction for each instance. CONCLUSIONS: Although the history of present illness is a short text segment averaging 300 words, it is a good predictor for a few conditions such as anxiety, depression, panic disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Proposed CNN and RNN models outperform baseline approaches and complement each other when evaluating on a per-label basis.",2017,Nov,J Biomed Inform,75S,,S138-S148,,10.1016/j.jbi.2017.06.010,28606869,#3771,Tran 2017,"",""
A pilot study on the capability of artificial intelligence in preparation of patients' educational materials for Indian public health issues.,Mondal H; Panigrahi M; Mishra B; Behera JK; Mondal S,"BACKGROUND: Patient education is an essential component of improving public health as it empowers individuals with the knowledge and skills necessary for making informed decisions about their health and well-being. Primary care physicians play a crucial role in patients' education as they are the first contact between the patients and the healthcare system. However, they may not get adequate time to prepare educational material for their patients. An artificial intelligence-based writer like ChatGPT can help write the material for physicians. AIM: This study aimed to ascertain the capability of ChatGPT for generating patients' educational materials for common public health issues in India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This observational study was conducted on the internet using the free research version of ChatGPT, a conversational artificial intelligence that can generate human-like text output. We conversed with the program with the question - ""prepare a patients' education material for X in India."" In the X, we used the following words or phrases - ""air pollution,"" ""malnutrition,"" ""maternal and child health,"" ""mental health,"" ""noncommunicable diseases,"" ""road traffic accidents,"" ""tuberculosis,"" and ""water-borne diseases."" The textual response in the conversation was collected and stored for further analysis. The text was analyzed for readability, grammatical errors, and text similarity. RESULT: We generated a total of eight educational documents with a median of 26 (Q1-Q3: 21.5-34) sentences with a median of 349 (Q1-Q3: 329-450.5) words. The median Flesch Reading Ease Score was 48.2 (Q1-Q3: 39-50.65). It indicates that the text can be understood by a college student. The text was grammatically correct with very few (seven errors in 3415 words) errors. The text was very clear in the majority (8 out of 9) of documents with a median score of 85 (Q1-Q3: 82.5-85) in 100. The overall text similarity index was 18% (Q1-Q3: 7.5-26). CONCLUSION: The research version of the ChatGPT (January 30, 2023 version) is capable of generating patients' educational materials for common public health issues in India with a difficulty level ideal for college students with high grammatical accuracy.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to harness AI methodologies to uncover hidden risk factors that trigger or aggravate suicide behaviors. METHODS: The primary dataset included 228,052 Facebook postings by 1,006 users who completed the gold-standard Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. This dataset was analyzed using a bottom-up research pipeline without a-priory hypotheses and its findings were validated using a top-down analysis of a new dataset. This secondary dataset included responses by 1,062 participants to the same suicide scale as well as to well-validated scales measuring depression and boredom. RESULTS: An almost fully automated, AI-guided research pipeline resulted in four Facebook topics that predicted the risk of suicide, of which the strongest predictor was boredom. A comprehensive literature review using APA PsycInfo revealed that boredom is rarely perceived as a unique risk factor of suicide. A complementing top-down path analysis of the secondary dataset uncovered an indirect relationship between boredom and suicide, which was mediated by depression. An equivalent mediated relationship was observed in the primary Facebook dataset as well. However, here, a direct relationship between boredom and suicide risk was also observed. CONCLUSION: Integrating AI methods allowed the discovery of an under-researched risk factor of suicide. The study signals boredom as a maladaptive 'ingredient' that might trigger suicide behaviors, regardless of depression.

Detecting Signs of Depression in Tweets in Spanish: Behavioral and Linguistic Analysis.,Leis A; Ronzano F; Mayer MA; Furlong LI; Sanz F,"BACKGROUND: Mental disorders have become a major concern in public health, and they are one of the main causes of the overall disease burden worldwide. Social media platforms allow us to observe the activities, thoughts, and feelings of people's daily lives, including those of patients suffering from mental disorders. There are studies that have analyzed the influence of mental disorders, including depression, in the behavior of social media users, but they have been usually focused on messages written in English. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to identify the linguistic features of tweets in Spanish and the behavioral patterns of Twitter users who generate them, which could suggest signs of depression. METHODS: This study was developed in 2 steps. In the first step, the selection of users and the compilation of tweets were performed. A total of 3 datasets of tweets were created, a depressive users dataset (made up of the timeline of 90 users who explicitly mentioned that they suffer from depression), a depressive tweets dataset (a manual selection of tweets from the previous users, which included expressions indicative of depression), and a control dataset (made up of the timeline of 450 randomly selected users). In the second step, the comparison and analysis of the 3 datasets of tweets were carried out. RESULTS: In comparison with the control dataset, the depressive users are less active in posting tweets, doing it more frequently between 23:00 and 6:00 (P<.001). The percentage of nouns used by the control dataset almost doubles that of the depressive users (P<.001). By contrast, the use of verbs is more common in the depressive users dataset (P<.001). The first-person singular pronoun was by far the most used in the depressive users dataset (80%), and the first- and the second-person plural pronouns were the least frequent (0.4% in both cases), this distribution being different from that of the control dataset (P<.001). Emotions related to sadness, anger, and disgust were more common in the depressive users and depressive tweets datasets, with significant differences when comparing these datasets with the control dataset (P<.001). As for negation words, they were detected in 34% and 46% of tweets in among depressive users and in depressive tweets, respectively, which are significantly different from the control dataset (P<.001). Negative polarity was more frequent in the depressive users (54%) and depressive tweets (65%) datasets than in the control dataset (43.5%; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Twitter users who are potentially suffering from depression modify the general characteristics of their language and the way they interact on social media.

Emotional Expression on Social Media Support Forums for Substance Cessation: Observational Study of Text-Based Reddit Posts.,Yang G; King SG; Lin HM; Goldstein RZ,"BACKGROUND: Substance use disorder is characterized by distinct cognitive processes involved in emotion regulation as well as unique emotional experiences related to the relapsing cycle of drug use and recovery. Web-based communities and the posts they generate represent an unprecedented resource for studying subjective emotional experiences, capturing population types and sizes not typically available in the laboratory. Here, we mined text data from Reddit, a social media website that hosts discussions from pseudonymous users on specific topic forums, including forums for individuals who are trying to abstain from using drugs, to explore the putative specificity of the emotional experience of substance cessation. OBJECTIVE: An important motivation for this study was to investigate transdiagnostic clues that could ultimately be used for mental health outreach. Specifically, we aimed to characterize the emotions associated with cessation of 3 major substances and compare them to emotional experiences reported in nonsubstance cessation posts, including on forums related to psychiatric conditions of high comorbidity with addiction. METHODS: Raw text from 2 million posts made, respectively, in the fall of 2020 (discovery data set) and fall of 2019 (replication data set) were obtained from 394 forums hosted by Reddit through the application programming interface. We quantified emotion word frequencies in 3 substance cessation forums for alcohol, nicotine, and cannabis topic categories and performed comparisons with general forums. Emotion word frequencies were classified into distinct categories and represented as a multidimensional emotion vector for each forum. We further quantified the degree of emotional resemblance between different forums by computing cosine similarity on these vectorized representations. For substance cessation posts with self-reported time since last use, we explored changes in the use of emotion words as a function of abstinence duration. RESULTS: Compared to posts from general forums, substance cessation posts showed more expressions of anxiety, disgust, pride, and gratitude words. ""Anxiety"" emotion words were attenuated for abstinence durations >100 days compared to shorter durations (t(12)=3.08, 2-tailed; P=.001). The cosine similarity analysis identified an emotion profile preferentially expressed in the cessation posts across substances, with lesser but still prominent similarities to posts about social anxiety and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. These results were replicated in the 2019 (pre-COVID-19) data and were distinct from control analyses using nonemotion words. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a unique subjective experience phenotype of emotions associated with the cessation of 3 major substances, replicable across 2 time periods, with changes as a function of abstinence duration. Although to a lesser extent, this phenotype also quantifiably resembled the emotion phenomenology of other relevant subjective experiences (social anxiety and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder). Taken together, these transdiagnostic results suggest a novel approach for the future identification of at-risk populations, allowing for the development and deployment of specific and timely interventions.",2023,Jul,J Med Internet Res,25,,e45267,,10.2196/45267,37467010,#3890,Yang 2023,"",""
Detection of Suicidality Among Opioid Users on Reddit: Machine Learning-Based Approach.,Yao H; Rashidian S; Dong X; Duanmu H; Rosenthal RN; Wang F,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, both suicide and overdose rates have been increasing. Many individuals who struggle with opioid use disorder are prone to suicidal ideation; this may often result in overdose. However, these fatal overdoses are difficult to classify as intentional or unintentional. Intentional overdose is difficult to detect, partially due to the lack of predictors and social stigmas that push individuals away from seeking help. These individuals may instead use web-based means to articulate their concerns. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to extract posts of suicidality among opioid users on Reddit using machine learning methods. The performance of the models is derivative of the data purity, and the results will help us to better understand the rationale of these users, providing new insights into individuals who are part of the opioid epidemic. METHODS: Reddit posts between June 2017 and June 2018 were collected from r/suicidewatch, r/depression, a set of opioid-related subreddits, and a control subreddit set. We first classified suicidal versus nonsuicidal languages and then classified users with opioid usage versus those without opioid usage. Several traditional baselines and neural network (NN) text classifiers were trained using subreddit names as the labels and combinations of semantic inputs. We then attempted to extract out-of-sample data belonging to the intersection of suicide ideation and opioid abuse. Amazon Mechanical Turk was used to provide labels for the out-of-sample data. RESULTS: Classification results were at least 90% across all models for at least one combination of input; the best classifier was convolutional neural network, which obtained an F(1) score of 96.6%. When predicting out-of-sample data for posts containing both suicidal ideation and signs of opioid addiction, NN classifiers produced more false positives and traditional methods produced more false negatives, which is less desirable for predicting suicidal sentiments. CONCLUSIONS: Opioid abuse is linked to the risk of unintentional overdose and suicide risk. Social media platforms such as Reddit contain metadata that can aid machine learning and provide information at a personal level that cannot be obtained elsewhere. We demonstrate that it is possible to use NNs as a tool to predict an out-of-sample target with a model built from data sets labeled by characteristics we wish to distinguish in the out-of-sample target.",2020,Nov,J Med Internet Res,22,11,e15293,,10.2196/15293,33245287,#3891,Yao 2020,"",""
Using natural language from a smartphone pregnancy app to identify maternal depression.,Krishnamurti T; Allen K; Hayani L; Rodriguez S; Rothenberger S; Moses-Kolko E; Simhan H,"Depression is highly prevalent in pregnancy, yet it often goes undiagnosed and untreated. Language can be an indicator of psychological well-being. This longitudinal, observational cohort study of 1,274 pregnancies examined written language shared in a prenatal smartphone app. Natural language feature of text entered in the app (e.g. in a journaling feature) throughout the course of participants' pregnancies were used to model subsequent depression symptoms. Language features were predictive of incident depression symptoms in a 30-day window (AUROC = 0.72) and offer insights into topics most salient in the writing of individuals experiencing those symptoms. When natural language inputs were combined with self-reported current mood, a stronger predictive model was produced (AUROC = 0.84). Pregnancy apps are a promising way to illuminate experiences contributing to depression symptoms. Even sparse language and simple patient-reports collected directly from these tools may support earlier, more nuanced depression symptom identification.",2023,Feb,Res Sq,,,,,10.21203/rs.3.rs-2583296/v1,36865248,#3895,Krishnamurti 2023,"",""
Identifying suicide documentation in clinical notes through zero-shot learning.,Workman TE; Goulet JL; Brandt CA; Warren AR; Eleazer J; Skanderson M; Lindemann L; Blosnich JR; O'Leary J; Zeng-Treitler Q,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In deep learning, a major difficulty in identifying suicidality and its risk factors in clinical notes is the lack of training samples given the small number of true positive instances among the number of patients screened. This paper describes a novel methodology that identifies suicidality in clinical notes by addressing this data sparsity issue through zero-shot learning. Our general aim was to develop a tool that leveraged zero-shot learning to effectively identify suicidality documentation in all types of clinical notes. METHODS: US Veterans Affairs clinical notes served as data. The training data set label was determined using diagnostic codes of suicide attempt and self-harm. We used a base string associated with the target label of suicidality to provide auxiliary information by narrowing the positive training cases to those containing the base string. We trained a deep neural network by mapping the training documents' contents to a semantic space. For comparison, we trained another deep neural network using the identical training data set labels, and bag-of-words features. RESULTS: The zero-shot learning model outperformed the baseline model in terms of area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value at multiple probability thresholds. In applying a 0.90 probability threshold, the methodology identified notes documenting suicidality but not associated with a relevant ICD-10-CM code, with 94% accuracy. CONCLUSION: This method can effectively identify suicidality without manual annotation.",2023,Sep,Health Sci Rep,6,9,e1526,,10.1002/hsr2.1526,37706016,#3899,Workman 2023,"",""

Large-scale Analysis of Counseling Conversations: An Application of Natural Language Processing to Mental Health.,Althoff T; Clark K; Leskovec J,"Mental illness is one of the most pressing public health issues of our time. While counseling and psychotherapy can be effective treatments, our knowledge about how to conduct successful counseling conversations has been limited due to lack of large-scale data with labeled outcomes of the conversations.

We develop a set of novel computational discourse analysis methods to measure how various linguistic aspects of conversations are correlated with conversation outcomes.

Publicly available machine learning models for identifying opioid misuse from the clinical notes of hospitalized patients.,Sharma B; Dligach D; Swope K; Salisbury-Afshar E; Karnik NS; Joyce C; Afshar M,"BACKGROUND: Automated de-identification methods for removing protected health information (PHI) from the source notes of the electronic health record (EHR) rely on building systems to recognize mentions of PHI in text, but they remain inadequate at ensuring perfect PHI removal. As an alternative to relying on de-identification systems, we propose the following solutions: (1) Mapping the corpus of documents to standardized medical vocabulary (concept unique identifier [CUI] codes mapped from the Unified Medical Language System) thus eliminating PHI as inputs to a machine learning model; and (2) training character-based machine learning models that obviate the need for a dictionary containing input words/n-grams. We aim to test the performance of models with and without PHI in a use-case for an opioid misuse classifier. METHODS: An observational cohort sampled from adult hospital inpatient encounters at a health system between 2007 and 2017. A case-control stratified sampling (n = 1000) was performed to build an annotated dataset for a reference standard of cases and non-cases of opioid misuse. Models for training and testing included CUI codes, character-based, and n-gram features. Models applied were machine learning with neural network and logistic regression as well as expert consensus with a rule-based model for opioid misuse. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC) were compared between models for discrimination. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test and visual plots measured model fit and calibration. RESULTS: Machine learning models with CUI codes performed similarly to n-gram models with PHI. The top performing models with AUROCs > 0.90 included CUI codes as inputs to a convolutional neural network, max pooling network, and logistic regression model. The top calibrated models with the best model fit were the CUI-based convolutional neural network and max pooling network. The top weighted CUI codes in logistic regression has the related terms 'Heroin' and 'Victim of abuse'.

ARCH: Large-scale Knowledge Graph via Aggregated Narrative Codified Health Records Analysis.,Gan Z; Zhou D; Rush E; Panickan VA; Ho YL; Ostrouchov G; Xu Z; Shen S; Xiong X; Greco KF; Hong C; Bonzel CL; Wen J; Costa L; Cai T; Begoli E; Xia Z; Gaziano JM; Liao KP; Cho K; Lu J,"OBJECTIVE: Electronic health record (EHR) systems contain a wealth of clinical data stored as both codified data and free-text narrative notes, covering hundreds of thousands of clinical concepts available for research and clinical care. The complex, massive, heterogeneous, and noisy nature of EHR data imposes significant challenges for feature representation, information extraction, and uncertainty quantification. To address these challenges, we proposed an efficient Aggregated naRrative Codified Health (ARCH) records analysis to generate a large-scale knowledge graph (KG) for a comprehensive set of EHR codified and narrative features. METHODS: The ARCH algorithm first derives embedding vectors from a co-occurrence matrix of all EHR concepts and then generates cosine similarities along with associated p-values to measure the strength of relatedness between clinical features with statistical certainty quantification. In the final step, ARCH performs a sparse embedding regression to remove indirect linkage between entity pairs. We validated the clinical utility of the ARCH knowledge graph, generated from 12.5 million patients in the Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system, through downstream tasks including detecting known relationships between entity pairs, predicting drug side effects, disease phenotyping, as well as sub-typing Alzheimer's disease patients. RESULTS: ARCH produces high-quality clinical embeddings and KG for over 60,000 EHR concepts, as visualized in the R-shiny powered web-API (https://celehs.hms.harvard.edu/ARCH/). The ARCH embeddings attained an average area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.926 and 0.861 for detecting pairs of similar EHR concepts when the concepts are mapped to codified data and to NLP data; and 0.810 (codified) and 0.843 (NLP) for detecting related pairs. Based on the p-values computed by ARCH, the sensitivity of detecting similar and related entity pairs are 0.906 and 0.888 under false discovery rate (FDR) control of 5%. For detecting drug side effects, the cosine similarity based on the ARCH semantic representations achieved an AUC of 0.723 while the AUC improved to 0.826 after few-shot training via minimizing the loss function on the training data set. Incorporating NLP data substantially improved the ability to detect side effects in the EHR. For example, based on unsupervised ARCH embeddings, the power of detecting drug-side effects pairs when using codified data only was 0.15, much lower than the power of 0.51 when using both codified and NLP concepts. Compared to existing large-scale representation learning methods including PubmedBERT, BioBERT and SAPBERT, ARCH attains the most robust performance and substantially higher accuracy in detecting these relationships. Incorporating ARCH selected features in weakly supervised phenotyping algorithms can improve the robustness of algorithm performance, especially for diseases that benefit from NLP features as supporting evidence. For example, the phenotyping algorithm for depression attained an AUC of 0.927 when using ARCH selected features but only 0.857 when using codified features selected via the KESER network[1]. In addition, embeddings and knowledge graphs generated from the ARCH network were able to cluster AD patients into two subgroups, where the fast progression subgroup had a much higher mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed ARCH algorithm generates large-scale high-quality semantic representations and knowledge graph for both codified and NLP EHR features, useful for a wide range of predictive modeling tasks.",2023,May,medRxiv,,,,,10.1101/2023.05.14.23289955,37293026,#3919,Gan 2023,"",""

Data are obtained from multiple sources, including service-specific surveys and widely used generic surveys. There are concerns about the timeliness of feedback, that some groups of patients and carers do not give feedback and that free-text feedback may be useful but is difficult to analyse. OBJECTIVE: To understand how to improve the collection and usefulness of patient experience data in services for people with long-term conditions using digital data capture and improved analysis of comments. DESIGN: The DEPEND study is a mixed-methods study with four parts: qualitative research to explore the perspectives of patients, carers and staff; use of computer science text-analytics methods to analyse comments; co-design of new tools to improve data collection and usefulness; and implementation and process evaluation to assess use of the tools and any impacts. SETTING: Services for people with severe mental illness and musculoskeletal conditions at four sites as exemplars to reflect both mental health and physical long-terms conditions: an acute trust (site A), a mental health trust (site B) and two general practices (sites C1 and C2). PARTICIPANTS: A total of 100 staff members with diverse roles in patient experience management, clinical practice and information technology; 59 patients and 21 carers participated in the qualitative research components. INTERVENTIONS: The tools comprised a digital survey completed using a tablet device (kiosk) or a pen and paper/online version; guidance and information for patients, carers and staff; text-mining programs; reporting templates; and a process for eliciting and recording verbal feedback in community mental health services. RESULTS: We found a lack of understanding and experience of the process of giving feedback. People wanted more meaningful and informal feedback to suit local contexts. Text mining enabled systematic analysis, although challenges remained, and qualitative analysis provided additional insights. All sites managed to collect feedback digitally; however, there was a perceived need for additional resources, and engagement varied. Observation indicated that patients were apprehensive about using kiosks but often would participate with support. The process for collecting and recording verbal feedback in mental health services made sense to participants, but was not successfully adopted, with staff workload and technical problems often highlighted as barriers. Staff thought that new methods were insightful, but observation did not reveal changes in services during the testing period. CONCLUSIONS: The use of digital methods can produce some improvements in the collection and usefulness of feedback. Context and flexibility are important, and digital methods need to be complemented with alternative methods. Text mining can provide useful analysis for reporting on large data sets within large organisations, but qualitative analysis may be more useful for small data sets and in small organisations. LIMITATIONS: New practices need time and support to be adopted and this study had limited resources and a limited testing time. FUTURE WORK: Further research is needed to improve text-analysis methods for routine use in services and to evaluate the impact of methods (digital and non-digital) on service improvement in varied contexts and among diverse patients and carers.

Can Text Messages Identify Suicide Risk in Real Time? A Within-Subjects Pilot Examination of Temporally Sensitive Markers of Suicide Risk.,Glenn JJ; Nobles AL; Barnes LE; Teachman BA,"Objective tools to assess suicide risk are needed to determine when someone is at imminent risk.

Mixed-effects models tested whether these constructs differed in general (means) and over time (slopes) two weeks before a suicide attempt, relative to lower-risk periods. Regarding mean differences, no language features uniquely differentiated suicide attempts from other episodes.

Identifying Women with Post-Delivery Posttraumatic Stress Disorder using Natural Language Processing of Personal Childbirth Narratives.,Bartal A; Jagodnik KM; Chan SJ; Babu MS; Dekel S,"BACKGROUND: Maternal mental disorders are considered a leading complication of childbirth and a common contributor to maternal death. In addition to undermining maternal welfare, untreated postpartum psychopathology can result in child emotional and physical neglect, and associated significant pediatric health costs. Some women may experience a traumatic childbirth and develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms following delivery (CB-PTSD). Although women are routinely screened for postpartum depression in the U.S., there is no recommended protocol to inform the identification of women who are likely to experience CB-PTSD. Advancements in computational methods of free text has shown promise in informing diagnosis of psychiatric conditions. Although the language in narratives of stressful events has been associated with post-trauma outcomes, whether the narratives of childbirth processed via machine learning can be useful for CB-PTSD screening is unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the utility of written narrative accounts of personal childbirth experience for the identification of women with provisional CB-PTSD. To this end, we developed a model based on natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) algorithms to identify CB-PTSD via classification of birth narratives. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 1,127 eligible postpartum women who enrolled in a study survey during the COVID-19 era provided short written childbirth narrative accounts in which they were instructed to focus on the most distressing aspects of their childbirth experience. They also completed a PTSD symptom screen to determine provisional CB-PTSD. After exclusion criteria were applied, data from 995 participants was analyzed. An ML-based Sentence-Transformer NLP model was used to represent narratives as vectors that served as inputs for a neural network ML model developed in this study to identify participants with provisional CB-PTSD. RESULTS: The ML model derived from NLP of childbirth narratives achieved good performance: AUC 0.75, F1-score 0.76, sensitivity 0.8, and specificity 0.70. Moreover, women with provisional CB-PTSD generated longer narratives (t-test results: t=2 . 30, p=0 . 02 ) and used more negative emotional expressions (Wilcoxon test: 'sadness': p=8 . 90e- (04) , W=31,017 ; 'anger': p=1 . 32e- (02) , W=35,005 . 50 ) and death-related words (Wilcoxon test: p=3 . 48e- (05) , W=34,538 ) in describing their childbirth experience than those with no CB-PTSD. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides proof of concept that personal childbirth narrative accounts generated in the early postpartum period and analyzed via advanced computational methods can detect with relatively high accuracy women who are likely to endorse CB-PTSD and those at low risk. This suggests that birth narratives could be promising for informing low-cost, non-invasive tools for maternal mental health screening, and more research that utilizes ML to predict early signs of maternal psychiatric morbidity is warranted.",2022,Aug,medRxiv,,,,,10.1101/2022.08.30.22279394,36093354,#3945,Bartal 2022,"",""

Attention-Based Models for Classifying Small Data Sets Using Community-Engaged Research Protocols: Classification System Development and Validation Pilot Study.,Ferrell BJ; Raskin SE; Zimmerman EB; Timberline DH; McInnes BT; Krist AH,"BACKGROUND: Community-engaged research (CEnR) is a research approach in which scholars partner with community organizations or individuals with whom they share an interest in the study topic, typically with the goal of supporting that community's well-being. CEnR is well-established in numerous disciplines including the clinical and social sciences. However, universities experience challenges reporting comprehensive CEnR metrics, limiting the development of appropriate CEnR infrastructure and the advancement of relationships with communities, funders, and stakeholders. OBJECTIVE: We propose a novel approach to identifying and categorizing community-engaged studies by applying attention-based deep learning models to human participants protocols that have been submitted to the university's institutional review board (IRB). METHODS: We manually classified a sample of 280 protocols submitted to the IRB using a 3- and 6-level CEnR heuristic. We then trained an attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory unit (Bi-LSTM) on the classified protocols and compared it to transformer models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations From Transformers (BERT), Bio + Clinical BERT, and Cross-lingual Language Model-Robustly Optimized BERT Pre-training Approach (XLM-RoBERTa). We applied the best-performing models to the full sample of unlabeled IRB protocols submitted in the years 2013-2019 (n>6000). RESULTS: Although transfer learning is superior, receiving a 0.9952 evaluation F1 score for all transformer models implemented compared to the attention-based Bi-LSTM (between 48%-80%), there were key issues with overfitting. This finding is consistent across several methodological adjustments: an augmented data set with and without cross-validation, an unaugmented data set with and without cross-validation, a 6-class CEnR spectrum, and a 3-class one. CONCLUSIONS: Transfer learning is a more viable method than the attention-based bidirectional-LSTM for differentiating small data sets characterized by the idiosyncrasies and variability of CEnR descriptions used by principal investigators in research protocols. Despite these issues involving overfitting, BERT and the other transformer models remarkably showed an understanding of our data unlike the attention-based Bi-LSTM model, promising a more realistic path toward solving this real-world application.",2022,Sep,JMIR Form Res,6,9,e32460,,10.2196/32460,36066925,#3959,Ferrell 2022,"",""
Knowledge discovery for Deep Phenotyping serious mental illness from Electronic Mental Health records.,Jackson R; Patel R; Velupillai S; Gkotsis G; Hoyle D; Stewart R,"Background: Deep Phenotyping is the precise and comprehensive analysis of phenotypic features in which the individual components of the phenotype are observed and described. In UK mental health clinical practice, most clinically relevant information is recorded as free text in the Electronic Health Record, and offers a granularity of information beyond what is expressed in most medical knowledge bases. The SNOMED CT nomenclature potentially offers the means to model such information at scale, yet given a sufficiently large body of clinical text collected over many years, it is difficult to identify the language that clinicians favour to express concepts. Methods: By utilising a large corpus of healthcare data, we sought to make use of semantic modelling and clustering techniques to represent the relationship between the clinical vocabulary of internationally recognised SMI symptoms and the preferred language used by clinicians within a care setting. We explore how such models can be used for discovering novel vocabulary relevant to the task of phenotyping Serious Mental Illness (SMI) with only a small amount of prior knowledge.  Results: 20 403 terms were derived and curated via a two stage methodology. The list was reduced to 557 putative concepts based on eliminating redundant information content. These were then organised into 9 distinct categories pertaining to different aspects of psychiatric assessment. 235 concepts were found to be expressions of putative clinical significance. Of these, 53 were identified having novel synonymy with existing SNOMED CT concepts. 106 had no mapping to SNOMED CT. Conclusions: We demonstrate a scalable approach to discovering new concepts of SMI symptomatology based on real-world clinical observation. Such approaches may offer the opportunity to consider broader manifestations of SMI symptomatology than is typically assessed via current diagnostic frameworks, and create the potential for enhancing nomenclatures such as SNOMED CT based on real-world expressions.",2018,,F1000Res,7,,210,,10.12688/f1000research.13830.2,29899974,#3977,Jackson 2018,"",""

Cross-lingual Unified Medical Language System entity linking in online health communities.,Bitton Y; Cohen R; Schifter T; Bachmat E; Elhadad M; Elhadad N,"OBJECTIVE: In Hebrew online health communities, participants commonly write medical terms that appear as transliterated forms of a source term in English. Such transliterations introduce high variability in text and challenge text-analytics methods. To reduce their variability, medical terms must be normalized, such as linking them to Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) concepts. We present a method to identify both transliterated and translated Hebrew medical terms and link them with UMLS entities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigate the effect of linking terms in Camoni, a popular Israeli online health community in Hebrew. Our method, MDTEL (Medical Deep Transliteration Entity Linking), includes (1) an attention-based recurrent neural network encoder-decoder to transliterate words and mapping UMLS from English to Hebrew, (2) an unsupervised method for creating a transliteration dataset in any language without manually labeled data, and (3) an efficient way to identify and link medical entities in the Hebrew corpus to UMLS concepts, by producing a high-recall list of candidate medical terms in the corpus, and then filtering the candidates to relevant medical terms. RESULTS: We carry out experiments on 3 disease-specific communities: diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and depression.

Well-structured open data and the smart systems that make the appropriate use of it are invaluable and can help health researchers and professionals to find the appropriate information by, e.g., configuring the monitoring of information or refining a specific query on a disease. METHODS: We present an automated text classifier approach based on the MEDLINE/MeSH thesaurus, trained on the manual annotation of more than 26 million expert-annotated scientific abstracts. The classifier was developed tailor-fit to the public health and health research domain experts, in the light of their specific challenges and needs. We have applied the proposed methodology on three specific health domains: the Coronavirus, Mental Health and Diabetes, considering the pertinence of the first, and the known relations with the other two health topics. RESULTS: A classifier is trained on the MEDLINE dataset that can automatically annotate text, such as scientific articles, news articles or medical reports with relevant concepts from the MeSH thesaurus. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed text classifier shows promising results in the evaluation of health-related news. The application of the developed classifier enables the exploration of news and extraction of health-related insights, based on the MeSH thesaurus, through a similar workflow as in the usage of PubMed, with which most health researchers are familiar.",2021,Apr,Artif Intell Med,114,,102053,,10.1016/j.artmed.2021.102053,33875160,#3992,PitaCosta 2021,"",""
Analysis of associations between emotions and activities of drug users and their addiction recovery tendencies from social media posts using structural equation modeling.,Jha D; Singh R,"BACKGROUND: Addiction to drugs and alcohol constitutes one of the significant factors underlying the decline in life expectancy in the US. Several context-specific reasons influence drug use and recovery. In particular emotional distress, physical pain, relationships, and self-development efforts are known to be some of the factors associated with addiction recovery. Unfortunately, many of these factors are not directly observable and quantifying, and assessing their impact can be difficult. Based on social media posts of users engaged in substance use and recovery on the forum Reddit, we employed two psycholinguistic tools, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count and Empath and activities of substance users on various Reddit sub-forums to analyze behavior underlining addiction recovery and relapse. We then employed a statistical analysis technique called structural equation modeling to assess the effects of these latent factors on recovery and relapse. RESULTS: We found that both emotional distress and physical pain significantly influence addiction recovery behavior. Self-development activities and social relationships of the substance users were also found to enable recovery. Furthermore, within the context of self-development activities, those that were related to influencing the mental and physical well-being of substance users were found to be positively associated with addiction recovery. We also determined that lack of social activities and physical exercise can enable a relapse. Moreover, geography, especially life in rural areas, appears to have a greater correlation with addiction relapse. CONCLUSIONS: The paper describes how observable variables can be extracted from social media and then be used to model important latent constructs that impact addiction recovery and relapse. We also report factors that impact self-induced addiction recovery and relapse. To the best of our knowledge, this paper represents the first use of structural equation modeling of social media data with the goal of analyzing factors influencing addiction recovery.",2020,Dec,BMC Bioinformatics,21,Suppl 18,554,,10.1186/s12859-020-03893-9,33375934,#3996,Jha 2020,"",""
Diversity in Psychological Research Activities: Quantitative Approach With Topic Modeling.,Otsuka S; Ueda Y; Saiki J,"Recent cultural studies have discussed universality and diversity in human behavior using numerous samples investigated worldwide. We aimed to quantitatively extend this discussion to various research activities in psychology in terms of geographic regions and time trends. Most psychology departments have specialists in various fields of psychology. Further, research institutions in all regions typically aim to provide systematic and balanced research education. Nevertheless, most researchers recognize universal features and patterns of diversity in research activities in psychology in terms of regional differences and time trends. However, these arguments remain intuitive and vague, and no studies have conducted quantitative analyses. To this end, we conducted topic modeling for the abstracts of psychological articles with the regions of author affiliations and publication periods as covariates. The results showed that the topic proportions related to basic research were high in North-Central America, whereas those related to clinical research were high in Europe. Interestingly, the regional differences shown by topic modeling were not observed in the frequency analysis of keywords, indicating that topic modeling revealed implicit characteristics. Moreover, we observed an increasing trend of neuroscience topics across publication periods. However, this trend was not valid for the psychology journal Psychological Science. Taken together, our results suggest diversity of geographic regions and periods in research activities in psychology. More importantly, our findings indicate that universality holds neither for human behavior nor research activities on human mental processes.",2021,,Front Psychol,12,,773916,,10.3389/fpsyg.2021.773916,34975665,#4002,Otsuka 2021,"",""

A naïve Bayes classifier was trained using the features extracted from the training data consisting of 600 manually annotated suicide notes. Classification was then performed using the naïve Bayes classifier as well as a set of pattern-matching rules. The classification performance was evaluated against a manually prepared gold standard consisting of 300 suicide notes, in which 1,091 out of a total of 2,037 sentences were associated with a total of 1,272 annotations.

This study aimed to clarify children's opinions by examining the structure of their text responses to open-ended web survey questions, as well as how they differed to the psychological and socio-economic status of their parents.Method　From September to October 2020, approximately six months after the temporary closure of schools in Japan due to COVID-19, 2,111 respondents (elementary, junior high, and high school students) answered a questionnaire on ""The third wave of CORONA-CODOMO project"" website. The text data of 1,140 students who provided free-text answers to open-ended questions such as, ""what are you concerned about and what do you want to say?"" (comments) and ""how should I get them to understand?"" (proposals) were analyzed. Results were stratified by parental demographics such as age, employment status, the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6), and financial status. The text mining assessed the frequency of word appearances, analyzed characteristic words, and showed a term network (word-relationship diagram).Results　The total number of lines (number of respondents) of comments and proposal texts were 531 and 1,017, respectively, and the average line length (number of characters) was 21.5 and 31.5, respectively. In the dependency relations frequency analysis, the actions of proposals and comments such as ""speaking-listening"", ""event-disappearing"", and ""mask-removing"" appeared. In the word network, words such as ""moving"" and ""speaking"" formed a strong co-occurrence network to ""I"", which had the largest node in proposals, while ""COVID-19"" in the comments strongly co-occurred with ""end+?""

Using the COVID-19 Pandemic to Assess the Influence of News Affect on Online Mental Health-Related Search Behavior Across the United States: Integrated Sentiment Analysis and the Circumplex Model of Affect.,Lekkas D; Gyorda JA; Price GD; Wortzman Z; Jacobson NC,"BACKGROUND: The digital era has ushered in an unprecedented volume of readily accessible information, including news coverage of current events. Research has shown that the sentiment of news articles can evoke emotional responses from readers on a daily basis with specific evidence for increased anxiety and depression in response to coverage of the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Given the primacy and relevance of such information exposure, its daily impact on the mental health of the general population within this modality warrants further nuanced investigation. OBJECTIVE: Using the COVID-19 pandemic as a subject-specific example, this work aimed to profile and examine associations between the dynamics of semantic affect in online local news headlines and same-day online mental health term search behavior over time across the United States. METHODS: Using COVID-19-related news headlines from a database of online news stories in conjunction with mental health-related online search data from Google Trends, this paper first explored the statistical and qualitative affective properties of state-specific COVID-19 news coverage across the United States from January 23, 2020, to October 22, 2020. The resultant operationalizations and findings from the joint application of dictionary-based sentiment analysis and the circumplex theory of affect informed the construction of subsequent hypothesis-driven mixed effects models. Daily state-specific counts of mental health search queries were regressed on circumplex-derived features of semantic affect, time, and state (as a random effect) to model the associations between the dynamics of news affect and search behavior throughout the pandemic. Search terms were also grouped into depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and nonspecific depression and anxiety symptoms to model the broad impact of news coverage on mental health. RESULTS: Exploratory efforts revealed patterns in day-to-day news headline affect variation across the first 9 months of the pandemic. In addition, circumplex mapping of the most frequently used words in state-specific headlines uncovered time-agnostic similarities and differences across the United States, including the ubiquitous use of negatively valenced and strongly arousing language. Subsequent mixed effects modeling implicated increased consistency in affective tone (Spin(VA) β=-.207; P<.001) as predictive of increased depression-related search term activity, with emotional language patterns indicative of affective uncontrollability (Flux(A) β=.221; P<.001) contributing generally to an increase in online mental health search term frequency. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated promise in applying the circumplex model of affect to written content and provided a practical example for how circumplex theory can be integrated with sentiment analysis techniques to interrogate mental health-related associations. The findings from pandemic-specific news headlines highlighted arousal, flux, and spin as potentially significant affect-based foci for further study. Future efforts may also benefit from more expansive sentiment analysis approaches to more broadly test the practical application and theoretical capabilities of the circumplex model of affect on text-based data.",2022,Jan,J Med Internet Res,24,1,e32731,,10.2196/32731,34932494,#4030,Lekkas 2022,"",""
Development and Evaluation of a Digital Scribe: Conversation Summarization Pipeline for Emergency Department Counseling Sessions towards Reducing Documentation Burden.,Sezgin E; Sirrianni J; Kranz K,"OBJECTIVE: We present a proof-of-concept digital scribe system as an ED clinical conversation summarization pipeline and report its performance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We use four pre-trained large language models to establish the digital scribe system: T5-small, T5-base, PEGASUS-PubMed, and BART-Large-CNN via zero-shot and fine-tuning approaches. Our dataset includes 100 referral conversations among ED clinicians and medical records. We report the ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L to compare model performance. In addition, we annotated transcriptions to assess the quality of generated summaries. RESULTS: The fine-tuned BART-Large-CNN model demonstrates greater performance in summarization tasks with the highest ROUGE scores (F1(ROUGE-1)=0.49, F1(ROUGE-2)=0.23, F1(ROUGE-L)=0.35) scores. In contrast, PEGASUS-PubMed lags notably (F1(ROUGE-1)=0.28, F1(ROUGE-2)=0.11, F1(ROUGE-L)=0.22). BART-Large-CNN's performance decreases by more than 50% with the zero-shot approach. Annotations show that BART-Large-CNN performs 71.4% recall in identifying key information and a 67.7% accuracy rate. DISCUSSION: The BART-Large-CNN model demonstrates a high level of understanding of clinical dialogue structure, indicated by its performance with and without fine-tuning. Despite some instances of high recall, there is variability in the model's performance, particularly in achieving consistent correctness, suggesting room for refinement. The model's recall ability varies across different information categories.

A hybrid system for emotion extraction from suicide notes.,Nikfarjam A; Emadzadeh E; Gonzalez G,"The reasons that drive someone to commit suicide are complex and their study has attracted the attention of scientists in different domains. Analyzing this phenomenon could significantly improve the preventive efforts. In this paper we present a method for sentiment analysis of suicide notes submitted to the i2b2/VA/Cincinnati Shared Task 2011. In this task the sentences of 900 suicide notes were labeled with the possible emotions that they reflect. In order to label the sentence with emotions, we propose a hybrid approach which utilizes both rule based and machine learning techniques. To solve the multi class problem a rule-based engine and an SVM model is used for each category. A set of syntactic and semantic features are selected for each sentence to build the rules and train the classifier. The rules are generated manually based on a set of lexical and emotional clues. We propose a new approach to extract the sentence's clauses and constitutive grammatical elements and to use them in syntactic and semantic feature generation. The method utilizes a novel method to measure the polarity of the sentence based on the extracted grammatical elements, reaching precision of 41.79 with recall of 55.03 for an f-measure of 47.50.

"Using a conversational agent for thought recording as a cognitive therapy task: Feasibility, content, and feedback.",Burger F; Neerincx MA; Brinkman WP,"E-mental health for depression is increasingly used in clinical practice, but patient adherence suffers as therapist involvement decreases. One reason may be the low responsiveness of existing programs: especially autonomous systems are lacking in their input interpretation and feedback-giving capabilities. Here, we explore (a) to what extent a more socially intelligent and, therefore, technologically advanced solution, namely a conversational agent, is a feasible means of collecting thought record data in dialog, (b) what people write about in their thought records, (c) whether providing content-based feedback increases motivation for thought recording, a core technique of cognitive therapy that helps patients gain an understanding of how their thoughts cause their feelings. Using the crowd-sourcing platform Prolific, 308 participants with subclinical depression symptoms were recruited and split into three conditions of varying feedback richness using the minimization method of randomization. They completed two thought recording sessions with the conversational agent: one practice session with scenarios and one open session using situations from their own lives. All participants were able to complete thought records with the agent such that the thoughts could be interpreted by the machine learning algorithm, rendering the completion of thought records with the agent feasible. Participants chose interpersonal situations nearly three times as often as achievement-related situations in the open chat session.

Detection of Cases of Noncompliance to Drug Treatment in Patient Forum Posts: Topic Model Approach.,Abdellaoui R; Foulquié P; Texier N; Faviez C; Burgun A; Schück S,"BACKGROUND: Medication nonadherence is a major impediment to the management of many health conditions. A better understanding of the factors underlying noncompliance to treatment may help health professionals to address it. Patients use peer-to-peer virtual communities and social media to share their experiences regarding their treatments and diseases. Using topic models makes it possible to model themes present in a collection of posts, thus to identify cases of noncompliance. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to detect messages describing patients' noncompliant behaviors associated with a drug of interest. Thus, the objective was the clustering of posts featuring a homogeneous vocabulary related to nonadherent attitudes. METHODS: We focused on escitalopram and aripiprazole used to treat depression and psychotic conditions, respectively. We implemented a probabilistic topic model to identify the topics that occurred in a corpus of messages mentioning these drugs, posted from 2004 to 2013 on three of the most popular French forums. Data were collected using a Web crawler designed by Kappa Santé as part of the Detec't project to analyze social media for drug safety. Several topics were related to noncompliance to treatment. RESULTS: Starting from a corpus of 3650 posts related to an antidepressant drug (escitalopram) and 2164 posts related to an antipsychotic drug (aripiprazole), the use of latent Dirichlet allocation allowed us to model several themes, including interruptions of treatment and changes in dosage. The topic model approach detected cases of noncompliance behaviors with a recall of 98.5% (272/276) and a precision of 32.6% (272/844). CONCLUSIONS: Topic models enabled us to explore patients' discussions on community websites and to identify posts related with noncompliant behaviors.

The Effect of Photoperiod on the Mood of Reddit Users.,Ethayarajh K; Rudzicz F,"Research into the seasonality of mood has long been stymied by a lack of data, in part due to the prohibitive cost of traditional data collection and the tendency for data to be highly localized.

We rely on the probability estimates returned by an SVM classifier and experimentally set thresholds on these probabilities. Emotion labels are assigned only if their probability exceeds a certain threshold and if the probability of the sentence being emotion-free is low enough.

Finding the Best Match - a Case Study on the (Text-)Feature and Model Choice in Digital Mental Health Interventions.,Zantvoort K; Scharfenberger J; Boß L; Lehr D; Funk B,"With the need for psychological help long exceeding the supply, finding ways of scaling, and better allocating mental health support is a necessity. This paper contributes by investigating how to best predict intervention dropout and failure to allow for a need-based adaptation of treatment. We systematically compare the predictive power of different text representation methods (metadata, TF-IDF, sentiment and topic analysis, and word embeddings) in combination with supplementary numerical inputs (socio-demographic, evaluation, and closed-question data). Additionally, we address the research gap of which ML model types - ranging from linear to sophisticated deep learning models - are best suited for different features and outcome variables. To this end, we analyze nearly 16.000 open-text answers from 849 German-speaking users in a Digital Mental Health Intervention (DMHI) for stress. Our research proves that - contrary to previous findings - there is great promise in using neural network approaches on DMHI text data. We propose a task-specific LSTM-based model architecture to tackle the challenge of long input sequences and thereby demonstrate the potential of word embeddings (AUC scores of up to 0.7) for predictions in DMHIs. Despite the relatively small data set, sequential deep learning models, on average, outperform simpler features such as metadata and bag-of-words approaches when predicting dropout. The conclusion is that user-generated text of the first two sessions carries predictive power regarding patients' dropout and intervention failure risk.

METHODS: Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity calculation method was used to screen the active components of CSP. Traditional Chinese Medicine System Pharmacological Database Analysis Platform and text mining tool (GoPuMed database) were used to predict and screen the active ingredients of CSP and anti-depressive targets. Through Genetic Association Database, Therapeutic Target Database, and PharmGkb database targets for depression were obtained. Cytoscape3.2.1 software was used to establish a network map of the active ingredients-targets of CSP, and to analyze gene function and metabolic pathways through Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery and the Omicshare database. RESULTS: The 121 active ingredients and 15 depression-related targets which were screened from the database can exert antidepressant effects by improving the neural plasticity, growth, transfer condition and gene expression of neuronal cell, and the raise of the expression of gap junction protein. The 15 targets passed 14 metabolic pathways, mainly involved in the regulation of neurotransmitters (5-hydroxytryptamine, dopamine and epinephrine), inflammatory mediator regulation of TRP channels, calcium signaling pathway, cyclic adenosine monophosphate signaling pathway and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and other signal channels to exert anti-depressant effects.

Removing Biases in Communication of Severity Assessments of Intimate Partner Violence: Model Development and Evaluation.,Sikstrom S; Dahl M; Claesdotter-Knutsson E,"BACKGROUND: To support a victim of violence and establish the correct penalty for the perpetrator, it is crucial to correctly evaluate and communicate the severity of the violence. Recent data have shown these communications to be biased. However, computational language models provide opportunities for automated evaluation of the severity to mitigate the biases. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether these biases can be removed with computational algorithms trained to measure the severity of violence described. METHODS: In phase 1 (P1), participants (N=71) were instructed to write some text and type 5 keywords describing an event where they experienced physical violence and 1 keyword describing an event where they experienced psychological violence in an intimate partner relationship. They were also asked to rate the severity. In phase 2 (P2), another set of participants (N=40) read the texts and rated them for severity of violence on the same scale as in P1. We also quantified the text data to word embeddings. Machine learning was used to train a model to predict the severity ratings. RESULTS: For physical violence, there was a greater accuracy bias for humans (r(2)=0.22) compared to the computational model (r(2)=0.31; t(38)=-2.37, P=.023). For psychological violence, the accuracy bias was greater for humans (r(2)=0.058) than for the computational model (r(2)=0.35; t(38)=-14.58, P<.001). Participants in P1 experienced psychological violence as more severe (mean 6.46, SD 1.69) than participants rating the same events in P2 (mean 5.84, SD 2.80; t(86)=-2.22, P=.029<.05), whereas no calibration bias was found for the computational model (t(134)=1.30, P=.195). However, no calibration bias was found for physical violence for humans between P1 (mean 6.59, SD 1.81) and P2 (mean 7.54, SD 2.62; t(86)=1.32, P=.19) or for the computational model (t(134)=0.62, P=.534). There was no difference in the severity ratings between psychological and physical violence in P1. However, the bias (ie, the ratings in P2 minus the ratings in P1) was highly negatively correlated with the severity ratings in P1 (r(2)=0.29) and in P2 (r(2)=0.37), whereas the ratings in P1 and P2 were somewhat less correlated (r(2)=0.11) using the psychological and physical data combined. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the computational model mitigates accuracy bias and removes calibration biases. These results suggest that computational models can be used for debiasing the severity evaluations of violence. These findings may have application in a legal context, prioritizing resources in society and how violent events are presented in the media.",2023,Apr,J Med Internet Res,25,,e43499,,10.2196/43499,37115589,#4101,Sikstrom 2023,"",""
Fine-tuning Strategies for Classifying Community-Engaged Research Studies Using Transformer-Based Models: Algorithm Development and Improvement Study.,Ferrell BJ,"BACKGROUND: Community-engaged research (CEnR) involves institutions of higher education collaborating with organizations in their communities to exchange resources and knowledge to benefit a community's well-being. While community engagement is a critical aspect of a university's mission, tracking and reporting CEnR metrics can be challenging, particularly in terms of external community relations and federally funded research programs. In this study, we aimed to develop a method for classifying CEnR studies that have been submitted to our university's institutional review board (IRB) to capture the level of community involvement in research studies. Tracking studies in which communities are ""highly engaged"" enables institutions to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the prevalence of CEnR. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop an updated experiment to classify CEnR and capture the distinct levels of involvement that a community partner has in the direction of a research study. To achieve this goal, we used a deep learning-based approach and evaluated the effectiveness of fine-tuning strategies on transformer-based models. METHODS: In this study, we used fine-tuning techniques such as discriminative learning rates and freezing layers to train and test 135 slightly modified classification models based on 3 transformer-based architectures: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), Bio+ClinicalBERT, and XLM-RoBERTa. For the discriminative learning rate technique, we applied different learning rates to different layers of the model, with the aim of providing higher learning rates to layers that are more specialized to the task at hand. For the freezing layers technique, we compared models with different levels of layer freezing, starting with all layers frozen and gradually unfreezing different layer groups. We evaluated the performance of the trained models using a holdout data set to assess their generalizability. RESULTS: Of the models evaluated, Bio+ClinicalBERT performed particularly well, achieving an accuracy of 73.08% and an F(1)-score of 62.94% on the holdout data set. All the models trained in this study outperformed our previous models by 10%-23% in terms of both F(1)-score and accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that transfer learning is a viable method for tracking CEnR studies and provide evidence that the use of fine-tuning strategies significantly improves transformer-based models. Our study also presents a tool for categorizing the type and volume of community engagement in research, which may be useful in addressing the challenges associated with reporting CEnR metrics.",2023,Feb,JMIR Form Res,7,,e41137,,10.2196/41137,36749611,#4102,Ferrell 2023,"",""
Toward Linguistic Recognition of Generalized Anxiety Disorder.,Rook L; Mazza MC; Lefter I; Brazier F,"BACKGROUND: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) refers to extreme, uncontrollable, and persistent worry and anxiety. The disorder is known to affect the social functioning and well-being of millions of people, but despite its prevalence and burden to society, it has proven difficult to identify unique behavioral markers. Interestingly, the worrying behavior observed in GAD is argued to stem from a verbal linguistic process. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate if GAD can be predicted from the language people use to put their anxious worries into words. Given the importance of avoidance sensitivity (a higher likelihood to respond anxiously to novel or unexpected triggers) in GAD, this study also explored if prediction accuracy increases when individual differences in behavioral avoidance and approach sensitivity are taken into account. METHOD: An expressive writing exercise was used to explore whether GAD can be predicted from linguistic characteristics of written narratives. Specifically, 144 undergraduate student participants were asked to recall an anxious experience during their university life, and describe this experience in written form. Clinically validated behavioral measures for GAD and self-reported sensitivity in behavioral avoidance/inhibition (BIS) and behavioral approach (BAS), were collected. A set of classification experiments was performed to evaluate GAD predictability based on linguistic features, BIS/BAS scores, and a concatenation of the two. RESULTS: The classification results show that GAD can, indeed, be successfully predicted from anxiety-focused written narratives. Prediction accuracy increased when differences in BIS and BAS were included, which suggests that, under those conditions, negatively valenced emotion words and words relating to social processes could be sufficient for recognition of GAD. CONCLUSIONS: Undergraduate students with a high GAD score can be identified based on their written recollection of an anxious experience during university life. This insight is an important first step toward development of text-based digital health applications and technologies aimed at remote screening for GAD. Future work should investigate the extent to which these results uniquely apply to university campus populations or generalize to other demographics.",2022,,Front Digit Health,4,,779039,,10.3389/fdgth.2022.779039,35493530,#4108,Rook 2022,"",""
Detecting Problematic Opioid Use in the Electronic Health Record: Automation of the Addiction Behaviors Checklist in a Chronic Pain Population.,Chatham AH; Bradley ED; Schirle L; Sanchez-Roige S; Samuels DC; Jeffery AD,"IMPORTANCE: Individuals whose chronic pain is managed with opioids are at high risk of developing an opioid use disorder. Large data sets, such as electronic health records, are required for conducting studies that assist with identification and management of problematic opioid use. OBJECTIVE: Determine whether regular expressions, a highly interpretable natural language processing technique, could automate a validated clinical tool (Addiction Behaviors Checklist(1)) to expedite the identification of problematic opioid use in the electronic health record. DESIGN: This cross-sectional study reports on a retrospective cohort with data analyzed from 2021 through 2023. The approach was evaluated against a blinded, manually reviewed holdout test set of 100 patients. SETTING: The study used data from Vanderbilt University Medical Center's Synthetic Derivative, a de-identified version of the electronic health record for research purposes. PARTICIPANTS: This cohort comprised 8,063 individuals with chronic pain. Chronic pain was defined by International Classification of Disease codes occurring on at least two different days.(18) We collected demographic, billing code, and free-text notes from patients' electronic health records. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the evaluation of the automated method in identifying patients demonstrating problematic opioid use and its comparison to opioid use disorder diagnostic codes. We evaluated the methods with F1 scores and areas under the curve - indicators of sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 8,063 individuals with chronic pain (mean [SD] age at earliest chronic pain diagnosis, 56.2 [16.3] years; 5081 [63.0%] females; 2982 [37.0%] male patients; 76 [1.0%] Asian, 1336 [16.6%] Black, 56 [1.0%] other, 30 [0.4%] unknown race patients, and 6499 [80.6%] White; 135 [1.7%] Hispanic/Latino, 7898 [98.0%] Non-Hispanic/Latino, and 30 [0.4%] unknown ethnicity patients).

Exploring the Online Behavior of Users of Online Depression-Focused Communities: Comparing Communities with Different Management Types.,Tang J; Yao X; Yu G,"INTRODUCTION: Online depression-focused communities (ODCs) are popular avenues that help people cope with depression. However, to the best of our knowledge, research on online behavior and differences among users from managed and unmanaged ODCs has not been explored. METHODS: We collected data from the most popular managed depression-focused community (MDC) and unmanaged depression-focused community (UDC) in China. Text classifiers were built using deep-learning methods to identify social support (ie, informational and emotional support) and companionship expressed in the posts of these communities. Based on the content of their posts, community users were clustered into supporters and ordinary members. Econometrics was used to analyze the factors that influence supporters' contributions and ordinary members' participation in MDCs and UDCs. RESULTS: Community response has a positive impact on supporters' social support and time span in the UDC, but this impact is not significant in the MDC. Supporters expressing positive emotions provide more social support, and they are more willing to serve in the MDC. Supporters expressing negative emotions tend to have longer engagement with the UDC. In addition, community response has a positive effect on ordinary members' participation in both communities, and this effect is greater in the UDC. Ordinary members expressing positive emotions are more active in the MDC, and ordinary members expressing negative emotions are more active in the UDC. CONCLUSION: This study improves the understanding of users' online behaviors in ODCs, provides decision-making support for designers and managers of ODCs, and provides information that can be used to help improve aid for people with depression provided by community and mental health professionals.",2021,,Psychol Res Behav Manag,14,,1707-1724,,10.2147/PRBM.S323027,34703334,#4117,Tang 2021,"",""
Digital hermeneutics: scaled readings of online depression discourses.,van de Ven I; van Nuenen T,"When it comes to understanding experiences of illness, humanities and social sciences research have traditionally reserved a prominent role for narrative. Yet, depression has characteristics that withstand the form of traditional narratives, such as a lack of desire and an impotence to act. How can a 'datafied' approach to online forms of depression writing pose a valuable addition to existing narrative approaches in health humanities? In this article, we analyse lay people's depression discourses online. Our approach, 'digital hermeneutics', is inspired by Gadamer's dialogical hermeneutics. It consists of a 'scaled reading' on five different scales: platform hermeneutics; contextual reading with term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF); distant reading with natural language processing topic modelling; hyper-reading with concordance views and close reading. Our corpus consisted of three data sets, from the blogs and message boards of, respectively, time-to-change.org.uk, a UK-based social organisation and movement that aims to counter mental health discrimination and alleviate social isolation by spreading awareness; Sane.org.uk, a leading UK mental health charity that seeks to help people in facing the challenges of mental illness and to improve quality of life; and the subreddit 'r/depression' on web discussion platform reddit. We found that the manner in which people express experiences of illness online is very much dependent on the specific affordances of platforms. We found degrees of 'narrativity' to be correlated to authorship and identity markers: the less 'anonymous' the writing, generally speaking, the more conventionally 'narrative' it was. Pseudonimity was related to more intimate and singular forms, with less pressure to conform to socially accepted and positive narratives of the 'restitution' type. We also found that interactive affordances of the platforms were used to a limited extent, nuancing assumptions about the polyvocality of online depression writing. We conclude by making a claim for increased cooperation between digital and medical humanities that might lead to a field of 'Digital Medical Humanities'.",2022,Sep,Med Humanit,48,3,335-346,,10.1136/medhum-2020-012104,34649932,#4119,vandeVen 2022,"",""
Artificial intelligence language predictors of two-year trauma-related outcomes.,Oltmanns JR; Schwartz HA; Ruggero C; Son Y; Miao J; Waszczuk M; Clouston SAP; Bromet EJ; Luft BJ; Kotov R,"BACKGROUND: Recent research on artificial intelligence has demonstrated that natural language can be used to provide valid indicators of psychopathology.

METHODS: The responders (N = 174, M(age) = 55.4 years) provided daily voicemail updates over 14 days. Algorithms developed using machine learning in large social media discovery samples were applied to the voicemail transcriptions to derive ALP scores for several risk factors (depressivity, anxiousness, anger proneness, stress, and personality). Responders also completed self-report assessments of these risk factors at baseline and trauma-related mental and physical health outcomes at two-year follow-up (including symptoms of depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, sleep disturbance, respiratory problems, and GERD). RESULTS: Voicemail ALPs were significantly associated with a majority of the trauma-related outcomes at two-year follow-up, over and above corresponding baseline self-reports. ALPs showed significant convergence with corresponding self-report scales, but also considerable uniqueness from each other and from self-report scales.

Interdisciplinary approach to identify language markers for post-traumatic stress disorder using machine learning and deep learning.,Quillivic R; Gayraud F; Auxéméry Y; Vanni L; Peschanski D; Eustache F; Dayan J; Mesmoudi S,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) lacks clear biomarkers in clinical practice. Language as a potential diagnostic biomarker for PTSD is investigated in this study. We analyze an original cohort of 148 individuals exposed to the November 13, 2015, terrorist attacks in Paris. The interviews, conducted 5-11 months after the event, include individuals from similar socioeconomic backgrounds exposed to the same incident, responding to identical questions and using uniform PTSD measures. Using this dataset to collect nuanced insights that might be clinically relevant, we propose a three-step interdisciplinary methodology that integrates expertise from psychiatry, linguistics, and the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community to examine the relationship between language and PTSD. The first step assesses a clinical psychiatrist's ability to diagnose PTSD using interview transcription alone. The second step uses statistical analysis and machine learning models to create language features based on psycholinguistic hypotheses and evaluate their predictive strength. The third step is the application of a hypothesis-free deep learning approach to the classification of PTSD in our cohort. Results show that the clinical psychiatrist achieved a diagnosis of PTSD with an AUC of 0.72. This is comparable to a gold standard questionnaire (Area Under Curve (AUC) ≈ 0.80).

Identification of social determinants of health using multi-label classification of electronic health record clinical notes.,Stemerman R; Arguello J; Brice J; Krishnamurthy A; Houston M; Kitzmiller R,"OBJECTIVES: Social determinants of health (SDH), key contributors to health, are rarely systematically measured and collected in the electronic health record (EHR). We investigate how to leverage clinical notes using novel applications of multi-label learning (MLL) to classify SDH in mental health and substance use disorder patients who frequent the emergency department. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We labeled a gold-standard corpus of EHR clinical note sentences (N = 4063) with 6 identified SDH-related domains recommended by the Institute of Medicine for inclusion in the EHR. We then trained 5 classification models: linear-Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, XGBoost, and bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BI-LSTM). We adopted 5 common evaluation measures: accuracy, average precision-recall (AP), area under the curve receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC), Hamming loss, and log loss to compare the performance of different methods for MLL classification using the F1 score as the primary evaluation metric. RESULTS: Our results suggested that, overall, BI-LSTM outperformed the other classification models in terms of AUC-ROC (93.9), AP (0.76), and Hamming loss (0.12). The AUC-ROC values of MLL models of SDH related domains varied between (0.59-1.0). We found that 44.6% of our study population (N = 1119) had at least one positive documentation of SDH.

Analyzing Suicide Risk From Linguistic Features in Social Media: Evaluation Study.,Lao C; Lane J; Suominen H,"BACKGROUND: Effective suicide risk assessments and interventions are vital for suicide prevention. Although assessing such risks is best done by health care professionals, people experiencing suicidal ideation may not seek help. Hence, machine learning (ML) and computational linguistics can provide analytical tools for understanding and analyzing risks. This, therefore, facilitates suicide intervention and prevention. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore, using statistical analyses and ML, whether computerized language analysis could be applied to assess and better understand a person's suicide risk on social media. METHODS: We used the University of Maryland Suicidality Dataset comprising text posts written by users (N=866) of mental health-related forums on Reddit. Each user was classified with a suicide risk rating (no, low, moderate, or severe) by either medical experts or crowdsourced annotators, denoting their estimated likelihood of dying by suicide. In language analysis, the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count lexicon assessed sentiment, thinking styles, and part of speech, whereas readability was explored using the TextStat library. The Mann-Whitney U test identified differences between at-risk (low, moderate, and severe risk) and no-risk users. Meanwhile, the Kruskal-Wallis test and Spearman correlation coefficient were used for granular analysis between risk levels and to identify redundancy, respectively. In the ML experiments, gradient boost, random forest, and support vector machine models were trained using 10-fold cross validation. The area under the receiver operator curve and F(1)-score were the primary measures. Finally, permutation importance uncovered the features that contributed the most to each model's decision-making. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences (P<.05) were identified between the at-risk (671/866, 77.5%) and no-risk groups (195/866, 22.5%). This was true for both the crowd- and expert-annotated samples. Overall, at-risk users had higher median values for most variables (authenticity, first-person pronouns, and negation), with a notable exception of clout, which indicated that at-risk users were less likely to engage in social posturing. A high positive correlation (ρ>0.84) was present between the part of speech variables, which implied redundancy and demonstrated the utility of aggregate features. All ML models performed similarly in their area under the curve (0.66-0.68); however, the random forest and gradient boost models were noticeably better in their F(1)-score (0.65 and 0.62) than the support vector machine (0.52). The features that contributed the most to the ML models were authenticity, clout, and negative emotions. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our statistical analyses found linguistic features associated with suicide risk, such as social posturing (eg, authenticity and clout), first-person singular pronouns, and negation. This increased our understanding of the behavioral and thought patterns of social media users and provided insights into the mechanisms behind ML models. We also demonstrated the applicative potential of ML in assisting health care professionals to assess and manage individuals experiencing suicide risk.",2022,Aug,JMIR Form Res,6,8,e35563,,10.2196/35563,36040781,#4156,Lao 2022,"",""
Automatic extraction of informal topics from online suicidal ideation.,Grant RN; Kucher D; León AM; Gemmell JF; Raicu DS; Fodeh SJ,"BACKGROUND: Suicide is an alarming public health problem accounting for a considerable number of deaths each year worldwide. Many more individuals contemplate suicide. Understanding the attributes, characteristics, and exposures correlated with suicide remains an urgent and significant problem. As social networking sites have become more common, users have adopted these sites to talk about intensely personal topics, among them their thoughts about suicide. Such data has previously been evaluated by analyzing the language features of social media posts and using factors derived by domain experts to identify at-risk users. RESULTS: In this work, we automatically extract informal latent recurring topics of suicidal ideation found in social media posts. Our evaluation demonstrates that we are able to automatically reproduce many of the expertly determined risk factors for suicide. Moreover, we identify many informal latent topics related to suicide ideation such as concerns over health, work, self-image, and financial issues. CONCLUSIONS: These informal topics topics can be more specific or more general. Some of our topics express meaningful ideas not contained in the risk factors and some risk factors do not have complimentary latent topics. In short, our analysis of the latent topics extracted from social media containing suicidal ideations suggests that users of these systems express ideas that are complementary to the topics defined by experts but differ in their scope, focus, and precision of language.",2018,Jun,BMC Bioinformatics,19,Suppl 8,211,,10.1186/s12859-018-2197-z,29897319,#4161,Grant 2018,"",""

More research is needed to understand user experiences of SCRA-related effects. We use semi-automated information processing techniques through eDrugTrends platform to examine SCRA-related effects and their variations through a longitudinal content analysis of web-forum data. METHOD: English language posts from three drug-focused web-forums were extracted and analyzed between January 1st 2008 and September 30th 2015. Search terms are based on the Drug Use Ontology (DAO) created for this study (189 SCRA-related and 501 effect-related terms). EDrugTrends NLP-based text processing tools were used to extract posts mentioning SCRA and their effects. Generalized linear regression was used to fit restricted cubic spline functions of time to test whether the proportion of drug-related posts that mention SCRA (and no other drug) and the proportion of these ""SCRA-only"" posts that mention SCRA effects have changed over time, with an adjustment for multiple testing. RESULTS: 19,052 SCRA-related posts (Bluelight (n=2782), Forum A (n=3882), and Forum B (n=12,388)) posted by 2543 international users were extracted. The most frequently mentioned effects were ""getting high"" (44.0%), ""hallucinations"" (10.8%), and ""anxiety"" (10.2%). The frequency of SCRA-only posts declined steadily over the study period.

Machine learning and natural language processing in psychotherapy research: Alliance as example use case.,Goldberg SB; Flemotomos N; Martinez VR; Tanana MJ; Kuo PB; Pace BT; Villatte JL; Georgiou PG; Van Epps J; Imel ZE; Narayanan SS; Atkins DC,"Artificial intelligence generally and machine learning specifically have become deeply woven into the lives and technologies of modern life. Machine learning is dramatically changing scientific research and industry and may also hold promise for addressing limitations encountered in mental health care and psychotherapy. The current paper introduces machine learning and natural language processing as related methodologies that may prove valuable for automating the assessment of meaningful aspects of treatment. Prediction of therapeutic alliance from session recordings is used as a case in point. Recordings from 1,235 sessions of 386 clients seen by 40 therapists at a university counseling center were processed using automatic speech recognition software. Machine learning algorithms learned associations between client ratings of therapeutic alliance exclusively from session linguistic content. Using a portion of the data to train the model, machine learning algorithms modestly predicted alliance ratings from session content in an independent test set (Spearman's ρ = .15, p < .001). These results highlight the potential to harness natural language processing and machine learning to predict a key psychotherapy process variable that is relatively distal from linguistic content. Six practical suggestions for conducting psychotherapy research using machine learning are presented along with several directions for future research. Questions of dissemination and implementation may be particularly important to explore as machine learning improves in its ability to automate assessment of psychotherapy process and outcome.

The Capability of ChatGPT in Predicting and Explaining Common Drug-Drug Interactions.,Juhi A; Pipil N; Santra S; Mondal S; Behera JK; Mondal H,"Background Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) can have serious consequences for patient health and well-being. Patients who are taking multiple medications may be at an increased risk of experiencing adverse events or drug toxicity if they are not aware of potential interactions between their medications. Many times, patients self-prescribe medications without knowing DDI. Objective The objective is to investigate the effectiveness of ChatGPT, a large language model, in predicting and explaining common DDIs. Methods A total of 40 DDIs lists were prepared from previously published literature. This list was used to converse with ChatGPT with a two-stage question. The first question was asked as ""can I take X and Y together?"" with two drug names. After storing the output, the next question was asked. The second question was asked as ""why should I not take X and Y together?"" The output was stored for further analysis. The responses were checked by two pharmacologists and the consensus output was categorized as ""correct"" and ""incorrect."" The ""correct"" ones were further classified as ""conclusive"" and ""inconclusive."" The text was checked for reading ease scores and grades of education required to understand the text. Data were tested by descriptive and inferential statistics. Results Among the 40 DDI pairs, one answer was incorrect in the first question. Among correct answers, 19 were conclusive and 20 were inconclusive. For the second question, one answer was wrong. Among correct answers, 17 were conclusive and 22 were inconclusive. The mean Flesch reading ease score was 27.64±10.85 in answers to the first question and 29.35±10.16 in answers to the second question, p = 0.47. The mean Flesh-Kincaid grade level was 15.06±2.79 in answers to the first question and 14.85±1.97 in answers to the second question, p = 0.69. When we compared the reading levels with hypothetical 6th grade, the grades were significantly higher than expected (t = 20.57, p < 0.0001 for first answers and t = 28.43, p < 0.0001 for second answers). Conclusion ChatGPT is a partially effective tool for predicting and explaining DDIs. Patients, who may not have immediate access to the healthcare facility for getting information about DDIs, may take help from ChatGPT. However, on several occasions, it may provide incomplete guidance. Further improvement is required for potential usage by patients for getting ideas about DDI.",2023,Mar,Cureus,15,3,e36272,,10.7759/cureus.36272,37073184,#4179,Juhi 2023,"",""

Examining Linguistic Differences in Electronic Health Records for Diverse Patients With Diabetes: Natural Language Processing Analysis.,Bilotta I; Tonidandel S; Liaw WR; King E; Carvajal DN; Taylor A; Thamby J; Xiang Y; Tao C; Hansen M,"BACKGROUND: Individuals from minoritized racial and ethnic backgrounds experience pernicious and pervasive health disparities that have emerged, in part, from clinician bias. OBJECTIVE: We used a natural language processing approach to examine whether linguistic markers in electronic health record (EHR) notes differ based on the race and ethnicity of the patient. To validate this methodological approach, we also assessed the extent to which clinicians perceive linguistic markers to be indicative of bias. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we extracted EHR notes for patients who were aged 18 years or older; had more than 5 years of diabetes diagnosis codes; and received care between 2006 and 2014 from family physicians, general internists, or endocrinologists practicing in an urban, academic network of clinics. The race and ethnicity of patients were defined as White non-Hispanic, Black non-Hispanic, or Hispanic or Latino. We hypothesized that Sentiment Analysis and Social Cognition Engine (SEANCE) components (ie, negative adjectives, positive adjectives, joy words, fear and disgust words, politics words, respect words, trust verbs, and well-being words) and mean word count would be indicators of bias if racial differences emerged. We performed linear mixed effects analyses to examine the relationship between the outcomes of interest (the SEANCE components and word count) and patient race and ethnicity, controlling for patient age. To validate this approach, we asked clinicians to indicate the extent to which they thought variation in the use of SEANCE language domains for different racial and ethnic groups was reflective of bias in EHR notes. RESULTS: We examined EHR notes (n=12,905) of Black non-Hispanic, White non-Hispanic, and Hispanic or Latino patients (n=1562), who were seen by 281 physicians. A total of 27 clinicians participated in the validation study. In terms of bias, participants rated negative adjectives as 8.63 (SD 2.06), fear and disgust words as 8.11 (SD 2.15), and positive adjectives as 7.93 (SD 2.46) on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being extremely indicative of bias. Notes for Black non-Hispanic patients contained significantly more negative adjectives (coefficient 0.07, SE 0.02) and significantly more fear and disgust words (coefficient 0.007, SE 0.002) than those for White non-Hispanic patients. The notes for Hispanic or Latino patients included significantly fewer positive adjectives (coefficient -0.02, SE 0.007), trust verbs (coefficient -0.009, SE 0.004), and joy words (coefficient -0.03, SE 0.01) than those for White non-Hispanic patients. CONCLUSIONS: This approach may enable physicians and researchers to identify and mitigate bias in medical interactions, with the goal of reducing health disparities stemming from bias.",2024,May,JMIR Med Inform,12,,e50428,,10.2196/50428,38787295,#4185,Bilotta 2024,"",""
Promoting Reproducible Research for Characterizing Nonmedical Use of Medications Through Data Annotation: Description of a Twitter Corpus and Guidelines.,O'Connor K; Sarker A; Perrone J; Gonzalez Hernandez G,"BACKGROUND: Social media data are being increasingly used for population-level health research because it provides near real-time access to large volumes of consumer-generated data. Recently, a number of studies have explored the possibility of using social media data, such as from Twitter, for monitoring prescription medication abuse. However, there is a paucity of annotated data or guidelines for data characterization that discuss how information related to abuse-prone medications is presented on Twitter. OBJECTIVE: This study discusses the creation of an annotated corpus suitable for training supervised classification algorithms for the automatic classification of medication abuse-related chatter. The annotation strategies used for improving interannotator agreement (IAA), a detailed annotation guideline, and machine learning experiments that illustrate the utility of the annotated corpus are also described. METHODS: We employed an iterative annotation strategy, with interannotator discussions held and updates made to the annotation guidelines at each iteration to improve IAA for the manual annotation task. Using the grounded theory approach, we first characterized tweets into fine-grained categories and then grouped them into 4 broad classes-abuse or misuse, personal consumption, mention, and unrelated. After the completion of manual annotations, we experimented with several machine learning algorithms to illustrate the utility of the corpus and generate baseline performance metrics for automatic classification on these data. RESULTS: Our final annotated set consisted of 16,443 tweets mentioning at least 20 abuse-prone medications including opioids, benzodiazepines, atypical antipsychotics, central nervous system stimulants, and gamma-aminobutyric acid analogs. Our final overall IAA was 0.86 (Cohen kappa), which represents high agreement. The manual annotation process revealed the variety of ways in which prescription medication misuse or abuse is discussed on Twitter, including expressions indicating coingestion, nonmedical use, nonstandard route of intake, and consumption above the prescribed doses. Among machine learning classifiers, support vector machines obtained the highest automatic classification accuracy of 73.00% (95% CI 71.4-74.5) over the test set (n=3271). CONCLUSIONS: Our manual analysis and annotations of a large number of tweets have revealed types of information posted on Twitter about a set of abuse-prone prescription medications and their distributions. In the interests of reproducible and community-driven research, we have made our detailed annotation guidelines and the training data for the classification experiments publicly available, and the test data will be used in future shared tasks.",2020,Feb,J Med Internet Res,22,2,e15861,,10.2196/15861,32130117,#4198,O'Connor 2020,"",""
Verification in the Early Stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Sentiment Analysis of Japanese Twitter Users.,Ueda R; Han F; Zhang H; Aoki T; Ogasawara K,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic prompted global behavioral restrictions, impacting public mental health. Sentiment analysis, a tool for assessing individual and public emotions from text data, gained importance amid the pandemic. This study focuses on Japan's early public health interventions during COVID-19, utilizing sentiment analysis in infodemiology to gauge public sentiment on social media regarding these interventions. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate shifts in public emotions and sentiments before and after the first state of emergency was declared in Japan. By analyzing both user-generated tweets and retweets, we aim to discern patterns in emotional responses during this critical period. METHODS: We conducted a day-by-day analysis of Twitter (now known as X) data using 4,894,009 tweets containing the keywords ""corona,"" ""COVID-19,"" and ""new pneumonia"" from March 23 to April 21, 2020, approximately 2 weeks before and after the first declaration of a state of emergency in Japan. We also processed tweet data into vectors for each word, employing the Fuzzy-C-Means (FCM) method, a type of cluster analysis, for the words in the sentiment dictionary. We set up 7 sentiment clusters (negative: anger, sadness, surprise, disgust; neutral: anxiety; positive: trust and joy) and conducted sentiment analysis of the tweet groups and retweet groups. RESULTS: The analysis revealed a mix of positive and negative sentiments, with ""joy"" significantly increasing in the retweet group after the state of emergency declaration. Negative emotions, such as ""worry"" and ""disgust,"" were prevalent in both tweet and retweet groups. Furthermore, the retweet group had a tendency to share more negative content compared to the tweet group. CONCLUSIONS: This study conducted sentiment analysis of Japanese tweets and retweets to explore public sentiments during the early stages of COVID-19 in Japan, spanning 2 weeks before and after the first state of emergency declaration. The analysis revealed a mix of positive (joy) and negative (anxiety, disgust) emotions. Notably, joy increased in the retweet group after the emergency declaration, but this group also tended to share more negative content than the tweet group. This study suggests that the state of emergency heightened positive sentiments due to expectations for infection prevention measures, yet negative information also gained traction.

Pediatric Diabetes Technology Management: An Italian Exploratory Study on Its Representations by Psychologists and Diabetologists.,Tupputi A; Giardinieri L; Monaco S; Di Trani M,"The incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) has increased by about 3% per year over the last two decades. Continuous Insulin Subcutaneous Therapy (CSII) is widely used in the pediatric population with diabetes; however, it requires more preparation by the treating team and a careful selection of its potential users. Prescriptive provisions vary from region to region, and the perspective of health workers in this regard remains an unexplored area. The aim of this research project is to explore the representations of a group of diabetologists and psychologists working in pediatric diabetology throughout the country, regarding their roles, functions, and activities as part of a multidisciplinary team; it also aims to investigate their views on the potential benefits of CSII and the types of individuals who apply for the use of this technology. A socio-anagraphic data sheet was administered, and two homogeneous focus groups were conducted, one for each profession, which were then audio recorded. The transcripts produced were analyzed using the Emotional Text Mining (ETM) methodology. Each of the two corpora generated three clusters and two factors. For diabetologists, a focus on patient care emerged at different levels, involving collaboration with other health professionals and engagement with the community, often incorporating technology in medical interventions. Similarly, psychologists' representations highlighted interdisciplinary networking with a stronger emphasis on the psychological processes involved in managing the disease, from acceptance to the elaboration and integration of diabetes into the family narrative.

Early identification of persistent somatic symptoms in primary care: data-driven and theory-driven predictive modelling based on electronic medical records of Dutch general practices.,Kitselaar WM; Büchner FL; van der Vaart R; Sutch SP; Bennis FC; Evers AW; Numans ME,"OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to early identify patients with persistent somatic symptoms (PSS) in primary care by exploring routine care data-based approaches. DESIGN/SETTING: A cohort study based on routine primary care data from 76 general practices in the Netherlands was executed for predictive modelling. PARTICIPANTS: Inclusion of 94 440 adult patients was based on: at least 7-year general practice enrolment, having more than one symptom/disease registration and >10 consultations. METHODS: Cases were selected based on the first PSS registration in 2017-2018. Candidate predictors were selected 2-5 years prior to PSS and categorised into data-driven approaches: symptoms/diseases, medications, referrals, sequential patterns and changing lab results; and theory-driven approaches: constructed factors based on literature and terminology in free text. Of these, 12 candidate predictor categories were formed and used to develop prediction models by cross-validated least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression on 80% of the dataset. Derived models were internally validated on the remaining 20% of the dataset. RESULTS: All models had comparable predictive values (area under the receiver operating characteristic curves=0.70 to 0.72). Predictors are related to genital complaints, specific symptoms (eg, digestive, fatigue and mood), healthcare utilisation, and number of complaints. Most fruitful predictor categories are literature-based and medications. Predictors often had overlapping constructs, such as digestive symptoms (symptom/disease codes) and drugs for anti-constipation (medication codes), indicating that registration is inconsistent between general practitioners (GPs). CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate low to moderate diagnostic accuracy for early identification of PSS based on routine primary care data. Nonetheless, simple clinical decision rules based on structured symptom/disease or medication codes could possibly be an efficient way to support GPs in identifying patients at risk of PSS.

Automatic recognition of symptom severity from psychiatric evaluation records.,Goodwin TR; Maldonado R; Harabagiu SM,"This paper presents a novel method for automatically recognizing symptom severity by using natural language processing of psychiatric evaluation records to extract features that are processed by machine learning techniques to assign a severity score to each record evaluated in the 2016 RDoC for Psychiatry Challenge from CEGS/N-GRID. The natural language processing techniques focused on (a) discerning the discourse information expressed in questions and answers; (b) identifying medical concepts that relate to mental disorders; and (c) accounting for the role of negation. The machine learning techniques rely on the assumptions that (1) the severity of a patient's positive valence symptoms exists on a latent continuous spectrum and (2) all the patient's answers and narratives documented in the psychological evaluation records are informed by the patient's latent severity score along this spectrum. These assumptions motivated our two-step machine learning framework for automatically recognizing psychological symptom severity. In the first step, the latent continuous severity score is inferred from each record; in the second step, the severity score is mapped to one of the four discrete severity levels used in the CEGS/N-GRID challenge. We evaluated three methods for inferring the latent severity score associated with each record: (i) pointwise ridge regression; (ii) pairwise comparison-based classification; and (iii) a hybrid approach combining pointwise regression and the pairwise classifier. The second step was implemented using a tree of cascading support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. While the official evaluation results indicate that all three methods are promising, the hybrid approach not only outperformed the pairwise and pointwise methods, but also produced the second highest performance of all submissions to the CEGS/N-GRID challenge with a normalized MAE score of 84.093% (where higher numbers indicate better performance). These evaluation results enabled us to observe that, for this task, considering pairwise information can produce more accurate severity scores than pointwise regression - an approach widely used in other systems for assigning severity scores. Moreover, our analysis indicates that using a cascading SVM tree outperforms traditional SVM classification methods for the purpose of determining discrete severity levels.",2017,Nov,J Biomed Inform,75S,,S71-S84,,10.1016/j.jbi.2017.05.020,28576748,#4254,Goodwin 2017,"",""

Statistically significant associations were found between mental illness statuses and sentiments and emotions. Posts expressing mental illness showed more negative sentiments and were more likely to express sadness and fear. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Patterns in social media discussions indicate both academic and non-academic consequences of having student debt, including users' desire to know more about their debts. Interventions should address the skill and information gaps between what is desired by the borrowers and what is offered to them in understanding and managing their debts. Cognitive burden created by student debts manifest itself on social media and can be used as an important marker to develop a nuanced understanding of people's expressions on a variety of socioeconomic issues. Higher volumes of negative sentiments and emotions of sadness, fear, and anger warrant immediate attention of policymakers and practitioners to reduce the cognitive burden of student debts.",2023,Sep,J Evid Based Soc Work (2019),20,5,727-742,,10.1080/26408066.2023.2202668,37461303,#4258,Sinha 2023,"",""
Schizophrenia Detection Using Machine Learning Approach from Social Media Content.,Bae YJ; Shim M; Lee WH,"Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder that ranks among the leading causes of disability worldwide. However, many cases of schizophrenia remain untreated due to failure to diagnose, self-denial, and social stigma. With the advent of social media, individuals suffering from schizophrenia share their mental health problems and seek support and treatment options. Machine learning approaches are increasingly used for detecting schizophrenia from social media posts. This study aims to determine whether machine learning could be effectively used to detect signs of schizophrenia in social media users by analyzing their social media texts. To this end, we collected posts from the social media platform Reddit focusing on schizophrenia, along with non-mental health related posts (fitness, jokes, meditation, parenting, relationships, and teaching) for the control group. We extracted linguistic features and content topics from the posts. Using supervised machine learning, we classified posts belonging to schizophrenia and interpreted important features to identify linguistic markers of schizophrenia. We applied unsupervised clustering to the features to uncover a coherent semantic representation of words in schizophrenia. We identified significant differences in linguistic features and topics including increased use of third person plural pronouns and negative emotion words and symptom-related topics. We distinguished schizophrenic from control posts with an accuracy of 96%. Finally, we found that coherent semantic groups of words were the key to detecting schizophrenia. Our findings suggest that machine learning approaches could help us understand the linguistic characteristics of schizophrenia and identify schizophrenia or otherwise at-risk individuals using social media texts.",2021,Sep,Sensors (Basel),21,17,,,10.3390/s21175924,34502815,#4266,Bae 2021,"",""
Emotional Contagion in the Online Depression Community.,Tang J; Yu G; Yao X,"Negative emotions are prevalent in the online depression community (ODC), which potentially puts members at risk, according to the theory of emotional contagion. However, emotional contagion in the ODC has not been confirmed. The generalized estimating equation (GEE) was used to verify the extent of emotional contagion using data from 1548 sample users in China's popular ODC. During interaction, the emotional themes were analyzed according to language use. The diurnal patterns of the interaction behaviors were also analyzed. We identified the susceptible groups and analyzed their characteristics. The results confirmed the occurrence of emotional contagion in ODC, that is, the extent to which the user's emotion was affected by the received emotion. Our study also found that when positive emotional contagion occurred, the replies contained more hopefulness, and when negative emotional contagion occurred, the replies contained more hopelessness and fear. Second, positive emotions were easier to spread, and people with higher activity in ODC were more susceptible. In addition, nighttime was an active period for user interaction. The results can help community managers and support groups take measures to promote the spread of positive emotions and reduce the spread of negative emotions.",2021,Nov,Healthcare (Basel),9,12,,,10.3390/healthcare9121609,34946335,#4274,Tang 2021,"",""
Time-synchronic comments on video streaming website reveal core structures of audience engagement in movie viewing.,Ni W; Coupé C,"To what extent movie viewers are swept into a fictional world has long been pondered by psychologists and filmmakers. With the development of time-synchronic comments on online viewing platforms, we can now analyze viewers' immediate responses toward movies. In this study, we collected over 3 million Chinese time-synchronic comments from a video streaming website. We first assessed emotion and cognition-related word rates in these comments with the Simplified Chinese version of the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (SCLIWC) and applied time-series clustering to the word rates. Then Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) was conducted on the text to investigate the prevalent topics among the comments. We found different commenting behaviors in front of various movies and prototypical diachronic trajectories of the psychological engagement of the audience. We further identified how topics are discussed through time, and tried to account for viewer's engagement, considering successively movie genres, topics and movie content. Among other points, we finally discussed the challenge in explaining the trajectories of engagement and the disconnection with narrative content.

This study used topic modeling to describe the most prevalent topics about alcohol in an online smoking cessation community, the prevalence of negative sentiment expressed about alcohol use in the context of a quit attempt (i.e., alcohol should be limited or avoided during a quit attempt) within topics, and the degree to which topics differed by user social connectivity within the network. METHODS: Data were analyzed from posts from the online community of a larger Internet cessation program, spanning January 1, 2012 to May 31, 2015 and included records of 814,258 online posts. Posts containing alcohol-related content (n = 7,199) were coded via supervised machine learning text classification to determine whether the post expressed negative sentiment about drinking in the context of a quit attempt. Correlated topic modeling (CTM) was used to identify a set of 10 topics of at least 1% prevalence based on the frequency of word occurrences among alcohol-related posts; the distribution of negative sentiment and user social network connectivity was examined across the most salient topics. RESULTS: Three salient topics (with prevalence ≥10%) emerged from the CTM, with distinct themes of (i) cravings and temptations; (ii) parallel between nicotine addiction and alcoholism; and (iii) celebratory discussions of quit milestones including ""virtual"" alcohol use and toasts. Most topics skewed toward nonnegative sentiment about alcohol. The prevalence of each topic differed by users' social connectivity in the network.

Therapeutic Claims in Cannabidiol (CBD) Marketing Messages on Twitter.,Soleymanpour M; Saderholm S; Kavuluru R,"Although the U.S. FDA has only approved exactly one cannabidiol (CBD) drug product (specifically to treat seizures), CBD products are proliferating rapidly through different modes of usage including food products, cosmetics, vaping pods, and supplements (typically, oils). Despite the FDA clearly warning consumers about unproven health claims made by manufacturers selling CBD products over the counter, the CBD market share was nearly 3 billion USD in 2020 and is expected to top 55 billion USD in 2028. In this context, it is important to assess the presence of health claims being made on social media, especially claims that are part of marketing messages. To this end, we collected over two million English tweets discussing CBD themes. We created a hand-labeled dataset and built machine learned classifiers to identify marketing tweets from regular tweets that may be generated by consumers. The best classifier achieved 85% precision, 83% recall, and 84% F-score. Our analyses showed that pain, anxiety disorders, sleep disorders, and stress are the four main therapeutic claims made constituting 31.67%, 27.11%, 13.77%, and 10.37% of all medical claims made on Twitter, respectively. Also, more than 93% of advertised CBD products are edibles or oil/tinctures. Our effort is the first to demonstrate the feasibility of surveillance of marketing claims for CBD products.

How Do Team-Level and Individual-Level Linguistic Styles Affect Patients' Emotional Well-Being-Evidence from Online Doctor Teams.,Liu X; Zhou S; Chi X,"BACKGROUND: In the post-epidemic era, online medical care is developing rapidly, and online doctor teams are attracting attention as a high-quality online medical service model that can provide more social support for patients. METHODS: Using online doctor teams on the Haodf.com platform as the research subject, this study investigates the key factors in the process of doctor-patient communication, which affects patients' emotional well-being. We also explore the different roles played by doctors as leaders and non-leaders in doctor-patient communication. From the perspective of language style, we select representative factors in the process of doctor-patient communication, namely the richness of health vocabulary, the expression of emotions, and the use of health-related terms (including perceptual words and biological words). We extract both team-level and individual-level linguistic communication styles through textual and sentiment analysis methods and empirically analyze their effects on patients' emotional well-being using multiple linear regression models. RESULTS: The results show that the expression of positive emotions by the team and attention to patients' perceptions and biological conditions benefit patients' emotional well-being. Leaders should focus on the emotional expression, whereas non-leaders should focus on the use of perceptual and biological words.

Trends in Language Use During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Relationship Between Language Use and Mental Health: Text Analysis Based on Free Responses From a Longitudinal Study.,Weger R; Lossio-Ventura JA; Rose-McCandlish M; Shaw JS; Sinclair S; Pereira F; Chung JY; Atlas LY,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated restrictions have been a major stressor that has exacerbated mental health worldwide. Qualitative data play a unique role in documenting mental states through both language features and content. Text analysis methods can provide insights into the associations between language use and mental health and reveal relevant themes that emerge organically in open-ended responses. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this web-based longitudinal study on mental health during the early COVID-19 pandemic was to use text analysis methods to analyze free responses to the question, ""Is there anything else you would like to tell us that might be important that we did not ask about?"" Our goals were to determine whether individuals who responded to the item differed from nonresponders, to determine whether there were associations between language use and psychological status, and to characterize the content of responses and how responses changed over time. METHODS: A total of 3655 individuals enrolled in the study were asked to complete self-reported measures of mental health and COVID-19 pandemic-related questions every 2 weeks for 6 months. Of these 3655 participants, 2497 (68.32%) provided at least 1 free response (9741 total responses). We used various text analysis methods to measure the links between language use and mental health and to characterize response themes over the first year of the pandemic. RESULTS: Response likelihood was influenced by demographic factors and health status: those who were male, Asian, Black, or Hispanic were less likely to respond, and the odds of responding increased with age and education as well as with a history of physical health conditions. Although mental health treatment history did not influence the overall likelihood of responding, it was associated with more negative sentiment, negative word use, and higher use of first-person singular pronouns. Responses were dynamically influenced by psychological status such that distress and loneliness were positively associated with an individual's likelihood to respond at a given time point and were associated with more negativity. Finally, the responses were negative in valence overall and exhibited fluctuations linked with external events. The responses covered a variety of topics, with the most common being mental health and emotion, social or physical distancing, and policy and government. CONCLUSIONS: Our results identify trends in language use during the first year of the pandemic and suggest that both the content of responses and overall sentiments are linked to mental health.",2023,Mar,JMIR Ment Health,10,,e40899,,10.2196/40899,36525362,#4299,Weger 2023,"",""
The language of sedation in end-of-life care: The ethical reasoning of care providers in three countries.,Seale C; Raus K; Bruinsma S; van der Heide A; Sterckx S; Mortier F; Payne S; Mathers N; Rietjens J,"The application of ethically controversial medical procedures may differ from one place to another. Drawing on a keyword and text-mining analysis of 156 interviews with doctors and nurses involved in end-of-life care ('care providers'), differences between countries in care providers' ethical rationales for the use of sedation are reported. In the United Kingdom, an emphasis on titrating doses proportionately against symptoms is more likely, maintaining consciousness where possible. The potential harms of sedation are perceived to be the potential hastening of social as well as biological death. In Belgium and the Netherlands, although there is concern to distinguish the practice from euthanasia, rapid inducement of deep unconsciousness is more acceptable to care providers. This is often perceived to be a proportionate response to unbearable suffering in a context where there is also greater pressure to hasten dying from relatives and others. This means that sedation is more likely to be organised like euthanasia, as the end 'moment' is reached, and family farewells are organised before the patient is made unconscious for ever. Medical and nursing practices are partly responses to factors outside the place of care, such as legislation and public sentiment. Dutch guidelines for sedation largely tally with the practices prevalent in the Netherlands and Belgium, in contrast with those produced by the more international European Association for Palliative Care whose authors describe an ethical framework closer to that reportedly used by UK care providers.",2015,Jul,Health (London),19,4,339-54,,10.1177/1363459314555377,25389235,#4308,Seale 2015,"",""

Mining of social media discussions about clinical trials has been used previously to identify patient barriers to enrollment in clinical trials; however, a comprehensive breakdown of sentiments and barriers by various racial and ethnic groups is lacking. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to use an innovative methodology to analyze web-based conversations about cancer clinical trials and to identify and compare conversation topics, barriers, and sentiments between different racial and ethnic populations. METHODS: We analyzed 372,283 web-based conversations about cancer clinical trials, of which 179,339 (48.17%) of the discussions had identifiable race information about the individual posting the conversations. Using sophisticated machine learning software and analyses, we were able to identify key sentiments and feelings, topics of interest, and barriers to clinical trials across racial groups. The stage of treatment could also be identified in many of the discussions, allowing for a unique insight into how the sentiments and challenges of patients change throughout the treatment process for each racial group. RESULTS: We observed that only 4.01% (372,283/9,284,284) of cancer-related discussions referenced clinical trials. Within these discussions, topics of interest and identified clinical trial barriers discussed by all racial and ethnic groups throughout the treatment process included health care professional interactions, cost of care, fear, anxiety and lack of awareness, risks, treatment experiences, and the clinical trial enrollment process. Health care professional interactions, cost of care, and enrollment processes were notably discussed more frequently in minority populations. Other minor variations in the frequency of discussion topics between ethnic and racial groups throughout the treatment process were identified.

Case-control study of neuropsychiatric symptoms following COVID-19 hospitalization in 2 academic health systems.,Castro VM; Rosand J; Giacino JT; McCoy TH; Perlis RH,"Neuropsychiatric symptoms may persist following acute COVID-19 illness, but the extent to which these symptoms are specific to COVID-19 has not been established. We utilized electronic health records across 6 hospitals in Massachusetts to characterize cohorts of individuals discharged following admission for COVID-19 between March 2020 and May 2021, and compared them to individuals hospitalized for other indications during this period. Natural language processing was applied to narrative clinical notes to identify neuropsychiatric symptom domains up to 150 days following hospitalization. Among 6,619 individuals hospitalized for COVID-19 drawn from a total of 42,961 hospital discharges, the most commonly documented symptom domains between 31 and 90 days after initial positive test were fatigue (13.4%), mood and anxiety symptoms (11.2%), and impaired cognition (8.0%). In models adjusted for sociodemographic features and hospital course, none of these were significantly more common among COVID-19 patients; indeed, mood and anxiety symptoms were less frequent (adjusted OR 0.72 95% CI 0.64-0.92). Between 91 and 150 days after positivity, most commonly-detected symptoms were fatigue (10.9%), mood and anxiety symptoms (8.2%), and sleep disruption (6.8%), with impaired cognition in 5.8%. Frequency was again similar among non-COVID-19 post-hospital patients, with mood and anxiety symptoms less common (aOR 0.63, 95% CI 0.52-0.75). Neuropsychiatric symptoms were common up to 150 days after initial hospitalization, but occurred at generally similar rates among individuals hospitalized for other indications during the same period.

METHODS: During interviews with trained psychiatrists and the AI-MADRS estimation system, patients responded orally to machine-generated voice prompts from the AI-MADRS structured interview questions. The severity scores estimated from two models of the AI-MADRS estimation system, the max estimation model and the average estimation model, were compared with those by trained psychiatrists. RESULTS: A total of 51 evaluation interviews conducted on 30 patients were analyzed.

Construction And Analysis Of The Time-Evolving Pain-Related Brain Network Using Literature Mining.,Oh J; Bae H; Kim CE,"PURPOSE: We aimed to quantitatively investigate how the neuroscience field developed over time in terms of its concept on how pain is represented in the brain and compare the research trends of pain with those of mental disorders through literature mining of accumulated published articles. METHODS: The abstracts and publication years of 137,525 pain-related articles were retrieved from the PubMed database. We defined 22 pain-related brain regions that appeared more than 100 times in the retrieved abstracts. Time-evolving networks of pain-related brain regions were constructed using the co-occurrence frequency. The state-space model was implemented to capture the trend patterns of the pain-related brain regions and the patterns were compared with those of mental disorders. RESULTS: The number of pain-related abstracts including brain areas steadily increased; however, the relative frequency of each brain region showed different patterns. According to the chronological patterns of relative frequencies, pain-related brain regions were clustered into three groups: rising, falling, and consistent. The network of pain-related brain regions extended over time from localized regions (mainly including brain stem and diencephalon) to wider cortical/subcortical regions. In the state-space model, the relative frequency trajectory of pain-related brain regions gradually became closer to that of mental disorder-related brain regions. CONCLUSION: Temporal changes of pain-related brain regions in the abstracts indicate that emotional/cognitive aspects of pain have been gradually emphasized. The networks of pain-related brain regions imply perspective changes on pain from the simple percept to the multidimensional experience. Based on the notable occurrence patterns of the cerebellum and motor cortex, we suggest that motor-related areas will be actively explored in pain studies.",2019,,J Pain Res,12,,2891-2903,,10.2147/JPR.S217036,31802931,#4348,Oh 2019,"",""

Research shows that treatment effectiveness is associated with focusing on these hotspots and that hotspot frequency and characteristics may serve as indicators for treatment success. Objective: This study aims to develop a model to automatically recognize hotspots based on text and speech features, which might be an efficient way to track patient progress and predict treatment efficacy. Method: A multimodal supervised classification model was developed based on analog tape recordings and transcripts of imaginal exposure sessions of 10 successful and 10 non-successful treatment completers. Data mining and machine learning techniques were used to extract and select text (e.g. words and word combinations) and speech (e.g. speech rate, pauses between words) features that distinguish between 'hotspot' (N = 37) and 'non-hotspot' (N = 45) phases during exposure sessions. Results: The developed model resulted in a high training performance (mean F (1)-score of 0.76) but a low testing performance (mean F (1)-score = 0.52). This shows that the selected text and speech features could clearly distinguish between hotspots and non-hotspots in the current data set, but will probably not recognize hotspots from new input data very well. Conclusions: In order to improve the recognition of new hotspots, the described methodology should be applied to a larger, higher quality (digitally recorded) data set.

"Exploring the Association Between the ""Big Five"" Personality Traits and Fatal Opioid Overdose: County-Level Empirical Analysis.",Tacheva Z; Ivanov A,"BACKGROUND: Opioid-related deaths constitute a problem of pandemic proportions in the United States, with no clear solution in sight. Although addressing addiction-the heart of this problem-ought to remain a priority for health practitioners, examining the community-level psychological factors with a known impact on health behaviors may provide valuable insights for attenuating this health crisis by curbing risky behaviors before they evolve into addiction. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is twofold: to demonstrate the relationship between community-level psychological traits and fatal opioid overdose both theoretically and empirically, and to provide a blueprint for using social media data to glean these psychological factors in a real-time, reliable, and scalable manner. METHODS: We collected annual panel data from Twitter for 2891 counties in the United States between 2014-2016 and used a novel data mining technique to obtain average county-level ""Big Five"" psychological trait scores. We then performed interval regression, using a control function to alleviate omitted variable bias, to empirically test the relationship between county-level psychological traits and the prevalence of fatal opioid overdoses in each county. RESULTS: After controlling for a wide range of community-level biopsychosocial factors related to health outcomes, we found that three of the operationalizations of the five psychological traits examined at the community level in the study were significantly associated with fatal opioid overdoses: extraversion (β=.308, P<.001), neuroticism (β=.248, P<.001), and conscientiousness (β=.229, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Analyzing the psychological characteristics of a community can be a valuable tool in the local, state, and national fight against the opioid pandemic. Health providers and community health organizations can benefit from this research by evaluating the psychological profile of the communities they serve and assessing the projected risk of fatal opioid overdose based on the relationships our study predict when making decisions for the allocation of overdose-reversal medication and other vital resources.",2021,Mar,JMIR Ment Health,8,3,e24939,,10.2196/24939,33683210,#4357,Tacheva 2021,"",""
Enhancing the conversational agent with an emotional support system for mental health digital therapeutics.,Wang Q; Peng S; Zha Z; Han X; Deng C; Hu L; Hu P,"As psychological diseases become more prevalent and are identified as the leading cause of acquired disability, it is essential to assist people in improving their mental health. Digital therapeutics (DTx) has been widely studied to treat psychological diseases with the advantage of cost savings. Among the techniques of DTx, a conversational agent can interact with patients through natural language dialog and has become the most promising one. However, conversational agents' ability to accurately show emotional support (ES) limits their role in DTx solutions, especially in mental health support. One of the main reasons is that the prediction of emotional support systems does not extract effective information from historical dialog data and only depends on the data derived from one single-turn interaction with users. To address this issue, we propose a novel emotional support conversation agent called the STEF agent that generates more supportive responses based on a thorough view of past emotions. The proposed STEF agent consists of the emotional fusion mechanism and strategy tendency encoder. The emotional fusion mechanism focuses on capturing the subtle emotional changes throughout a conversation. The strategy tendency encoder aims at foreseeing strategy evolution through multi-source interactions and extracting latent strategy semantic embedding. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset ESConv demonstrate the effectiveness of the STEF agent compared with competitive baselines.",2023,,Front Psychiatry,14,,1148534,,10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1148534,37139323,#4365,Wang 2023,"",""
Examining stigma relating to substance use and contextual factors in social media discussions.,Chen AT; Johnny S; Conway M,"BACKGROUND: Stigma associated with substance use can have severe negative consequences for physical and mental health and serve as a barrier to treatment. Yet, research on stigma processes and stigma reduction interventions is limited. AIM: We use a social media dataset to examine: 1) the nature of stigma-related experience related to substance use; and 2) salient affective and temporal factors in the use of three substances: alcohol, cannabis, and opioids. METHODS: We harvested several years of data pertaining to three substances - alcohol, cannabis, and opioids - from Reddit, a popular social networking platform. For Part I, we selected posts based on stigma-related keywords, performed content analysis, and rendered word clouds to examine the nature of stigma associated with these substances. In Part II, we employed natural language processing in conjunction with hierarchical clustering and visualization to explore temporal and affective factors. RESULTS: In Part I, internalized stigma was most commonly exhibited. Anticipated and enacted stigma were less common in posts relating to cannabis compared to the other two substances. Work, home, and school were important contexts in which stigma was observed. Part II showed that temporal markers were prominent; post authors shared stories of substance use journeys, and timelines of their experience with quitting and withdrawals. Shame, sadness, anxiety, and fear were common, with shame being more prominent in alcohol-related posts.

External validation of an opioid misuse machine learning classifier in hospitalized adult patients.,Afshar M; Sharma B; Bhalla S; Thompson HM; Dligach D; Boley RA; Kishen E; Simmons A; Perticone K; Karnik NS,"BACKGROUND: Opioid misuse screening in hospitals is resource-intensive and rarely done. Many hospitalized patients are never offered opioid treatment. An automated approach leveraging routinely captured electronic health record (EHR) data may be easier for hospitals to institute. We previously derived and internally validated an opioid classifier in a separate hospital setting. The aim is to externally validate our previously published and open-source machine-learning classifier at a different hospital for identifying cases of opioid misuse. METHODS: An observational cohort of 56,227 adult hospitalizations was examined between October 2017 and December 2019 during a hospital-wide substance use screening program with manual screening. Manually completed Drug Abuse Screening Test served as the reference standard to validate a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier with coded word embedding features from the clinical notes of the EHR. The opioid classifier utilized all notes in the EHR and sensitivity analysis was also performed on the first 24 h of notes. Calibration was performed to account for the lower prevalence than in the original cohort. RESULTS: Manual screening for substance misuse was completed in 67.8% (n = 56,227) with 1.1% (n = 628) identified with opioid misuse. The data for external validation included 2,482,900 notes with 67,969 unique clinical concept features. The opioid classifier had an AUC of 0.99 (95% CI 0.99-0.99) across the encounter and 0.98 (95% CI 0.98-0.99) using only the first 24 h of notes. In the calibrated classifier, the sensitivity and positive predictive value were 0.81 (95% CI 0.77-0.84) and 0.72 (95% CI 0.68-0.75). For the first 24 h, they were 0.75 (95% CI 0.71-0.78) and 0.61 (95% CI 0.57-0.64). CONCLUSIONS: Our opioid misuse classifier had good discrimination during external validation.

The results demonstrate that ASR failures have a negative, detrimental impact on African American users. Specifically, African Americans feel othered when using technology powered by ASR-errors surface thoughts about identity, namely about race and geographic location-leaving them feeling that the technology was not made for them. As a result, African Americans accommodate their speech to have better success with the technology. We incorporate the insights and lessons learned from sociolinguistics in our suggestions for linguistically responsive ways to build more inclusive voice systems that consider African American users' needs, attitudes, and speech patterns. Our findings suggest that the use of a diary study can enable researchers to best understand the experiences and needs of communities who are often misunderstood by ASR.

Transparent deep learning to identify autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in EHR using clinical notes.,Leroy G; Andrews JG; KeAlohi-Preece M; Jaswani A; Song H; Galindo MK; Rice SA,"OBJECTIVE: Machine learning (ML) is increasingly employed to diagnose medical conditions, with algorithms trained to assign a single label using a black-box approach. We created an ML approach using deep learning that generates outcomes that are transparent and in line with clinical, diagnostic rules. We demonstrate our approach for autism spectrum disorders (ASD), a neurodevelopmental condition with increasing prevalence. METHODS: We use unstructured data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance records labeled by a CDC-trained clinician with ASD A1-3 and B1-4 criterion labels per sentence and with ASD cases labels per record using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM5) rules. One rule-based and three deep ML algorithms and six ensembles were compared and evaluated using a test set with 6773 sentences (N = 35 cases) set aside in advance. Criterion and case labeling were evaluated for each ML algorithm and ensemble. Case labeling outcomes were compared also with seven traditional tests. RESULTS: Performance for criterion labeling was highest for the hybrid BiLSTM ML model. The best case labeling was achieved by an ensemble of two BiLSTM ML models using a majority vote. It achieved 100% precision (or PPV), 83% recall (or sensitivity), 100% specificity, 91% accuracy, and 0.91 F-measure. A comparison with existing diagnostic tests shows that our best ensemble was more accurate overall. CONCLUSIONS: Transparent ML is achievable even with small datasets. By focusing on intermediate steps, deep ML can provide transparent decisions. By leveraging data redundancies, ML errors at the intermediate level have a low impact on final outcomes.",2024,May,J Am Med Inform Assoc,31,6,1313-1321,,10.1093/jamia/ocae080,38626184,#4385,Leroy 2024,"",""
Demystifying the Dark Web Opioid Trade: Content Analysis on Anonymous Market Listings and Forum Posts.,Li Z; Du X; Liao X; Jiang X; Champagne-Langabeer T,"BACKGROUND: Opioid use disorder presents a public health issue afflicting millions across the globe. There is a pressing need to understand the opioid supply chain to gain new insights into the mitigation of opioid use and effectively combat the opioid crisis. The role of anonymous online marketplaces and forums that resemble eBay or Amazon, where anyone can post, browse, and purchase opioid commodities, has become increasingly important in opioid trading. Therefore, a greater understanding of anonymous markets and forums may enable public health officials and other stakeholders to comprehend the scope of the crisis. However, to the best of our knowledge, no large-scale study, which may cross multiple anonymous marketplaces and is cross-sectional, has been conducted to profile the opioid supply chain and unveil characteristics of opioid suppliers, commodities, and transactions. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to profile the opioid supply chain in anonymous markets and forums via a large-scale, longitudinal measurement study on anonymous market listings and posts. Toward this, we propose a series of techniques to collect data; identify opioid jargon terms used in the anonymous marketplaces and forums; and profile the opioid commodities, suppliers, and transactions. METHODS: We first conducted a whole-site crawl of anonymous online marketplaces and forums to solicit data. We then developed a suite of opioid domain-specific text mining techniques (eg, opioid jargon detection and opioid trading information retrieval) to recognize information relevant to opioid trading activities (eg, commodities, price, shipping information, and suppliers). Subsequently, we conducted a comprehensive, large-scale, longitudinal study to demystify opioid trading activities in anonymous markets and forums. RESULTS: A total of 248,359 listings from 10 anonymous online marketplaces and 1,138,961 traces (ie, threads of posts) from 6 underground forums were collected. Among them, we identified 28,106 opioid product listings and 13,508 opioid-related promotional and review forum traces from 5147 unique opioid suppliers' IDs and 2778 unique opioid buyers' IDs. Our study characterized opioid suppliers (eg, activeness and cross-market activities), commodities (eg, popular items and their evolution), and transactions (eg, origins and shipping destination) in anonymous marketplaces and forums, which enabled a greater understanding of the underground trading activities involved in international opioid supply and demand. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide insight into opioid trading in the anonymous markets and forums and may prove an effective mitigation data point for illuminating the opioid supply chain.",2021,Feb,J Med Internet Res,23,2,e24486,,10.2196/24486,33595442,#4386,Li 2021,"",""
Mobile Peer-Support for Opioid Use Disorders: Refinement of an Innovative Machine Learning Tool.,Scherzer CR; Ranney ML; Jain S; Bommaraju SP; Patena J; Langdon K; Nimaja E; Jennings E; Beaudoin FL,"BACKGROUND: The majority of individuals with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) do not receive any formal substance use treatment. Due to limited engagement and access to traditional treatment, there is increasing evidence that patients with OUDs turn to online social platforms to access peer support and obtain health-related information about addiction and recovery. Interacting with peers before and during recovery is a key component of many evidence-based addiction recovery programs, and may improve self-efficacy and treatment engagement as well as reduce relapse. Commonly-used online social platforms are limited in utility and scalability as an adjunct to addiction treatment; lack effective content moderation (e.g., misinformed advice, maliciousness or ""trolling""); and lack common security and ethical safeguards inherent to clinical care. METHODS: This present study will develop a novel, artificial-intelligence (AI) enabled, mobile treatment delivery method that fulfills the need for a robust, secure, technology-based peer support platform to support patients with OUD. Forty adults receiving outpatient buprenorphine treatment for OUD will be asked to pilot a smartphone-based mobile peer support application, the ""Marigold App"", for a duration of six weeks. The program will use (1) a prospective cohort study to obtain text message content and feasibility metrics, and (2) qualitative interviews to evaluate usability and acceptability of the mobile platform. ANTICIPATED FINDINGS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS: The Marigold mobile platform will allow patients to access a tailored chat support group 24/7 as a complement to different forms of clinical OUD treatment. Marigold can keep groups safe and constructive by augmenting chats with AI tools capable of understanding the emotional sentiment in messages, automatically ""flagging"" critical or clinically relevant content. This project will demonstrate the robustness of these AI tools by adapting them to catch OUD-specific ""flags"" in peer messages while also examining the adoptability of the platform itself within OUD patients.",2020,,J Psychiatr Brain Sci,5,1,,,10.20900/jpbs.20200001,32149192,#4388,Scherzer 2020,"",""
Luteolin and triptolide: Potential therapeutic compounds for post-stroke depression via protein STAT.,Zhao T; Sun S; Gao Y; Rong Y; Wang H; Qi S; Li Y,"Post stroke depression (PSD) is a common neuropsychiatric complication following stroke closely associated with the immune system. The development of medications for PSD remains to be a considerable challenge due to the unclear mechanism of PSD. Multiple researches agree that the functions of gene ontology (GO) are efficient for the investigation of disease mechanisms, and DeepPurpose (DP) is extremely valuable for the mining of new drugs. However, GO terms and DP have not yet been applied to explore the pathogenesis and drug treatment of PSD. This study aimed to interpret the mechanism of PSD and discover important drug candidates targeting risk proteins, based on immune-related risk GO functions and informatics algorithms. According to the risk genes of PSD, we identified 335 immune-related risk GO functions and 37 compounds. Based on the construction of the GO function network, we found that STAT protein may be a pivot protein in underlying the mechanism of PSD. Additionally, we also established networks of Protein-Protein Interaction as well as Gene-GO function to facilitate the evaluation of key genes. Based on DP, a total of 37 candidate compounds targeting 7 key proteins were identified with a potential for the therapy of PSD. Furthermore, we noted that the mechanisms by which luteolin and triptolide acting on STAT-related GO function might involve three crucial pathways, including specifically hsa04010 (MAPK signaling pathway), hsa04151 (PI3K-Akt signaling pathway) and hsa04060 (Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction).

Mapping of Transdiagnostic Neuropsychiatric Phenotypes Across Patients in Two General Hospitals.,Hart KL; Perlis RH; McCoy TH,"BACKGROUND: Multidimensional transdiagnostic phenotyping systems are increasingly important to neuropsychiatric phenotyping, particularly in translational research settings. The relationship the National Institute of Mental Health's Research Domain Criteria multidimensional approach to psychopathology and nonpsychiatric diagnoses has not been studied at scale but is relevant to those caring for neuropsychiatric illness in medical and surgical settings. METHODS: We applied the CQH Dimensional Phenotyper natural language processing tool to estimate National Institute of Mental Health's Research Domain Criteria domain-associated symptoms of individuals admitted to nonpsychiatric wards at each of 2 large academic general hospitals over an 8-year period. We compared patterns in individual domain symptom burden, as well as a new pooled unidimensional measure, by primary medical and surgical diagnosis. RESULTS: Analysis included 227,243 patients from hospital 1 of whom 68,793 (30.3%) had a prior psychiatric history and 220,213 patients from hospital 2 of whom 50,818 (23.1%) had a prior psychiatric history. The distribution of Research Domain Criteria symptom burdens over primary diagnosis was similar across hospital sites and differed significantly across primary medical or surgical diagnosis. The effect of primary medical or surgical diagnosis was larger than that of prior psychiatric history on Research Domain Criteria symptom burden. CONCLUSION: Research Domain Criteria-based neuropsychiatric symptom burden estimated from general hospital patients' clinical documentation is more strongly associated with the primary hospital medical or surgical diagnosis than it is with the presence of a previous psychiatric history.

Language patterns of outgroup prejudice.,Li Y; T Hills T,"Although explicit verbal expression of prejudice and stereotypes may have become less common due to the recent rise of social norms against prejudice, prejudice in language still persists in more subtle forms. It remains unclear whether and how language patterns predict variance in prejudice across a large number of minority groups. Informed by construal level theory, intergroup-contact theory, and linguistic expectancy bias, we leverage a natural language corpus of 1.8 million newspaper articles to investigate patterns of language referencing 60 U.S. minority groups. We found that perception of social distance among immigrant groups is reflected in language production: Groups perceived as socially distant (vs. close) are also more likely to be mentioned in abstract (vs. concrete) language. Concreteness was also strongly positively correlated with sentiment, a phenomenon that was unique to language concerning minority groups, suggesting a strong tendency for more socially distant groups to be represented with more negative language. We also provide a qualitative exploration of the content of outgroup prejudice by applying Latent Dirichlet Allocation to language referencing minority groups in the context of immigration. We identified 15 immigrant-related topics (e.g., politics, arts, crime, illegal workers, museums, food) and the strength of their association and relationship with perceived sentiment for each minority group. This research demonstrates how perceived social distance and language concreteness are related and correlate with outgroup negativity, provides a practical and ecologically valid method for investigating perceptions of minority groups in language, and helps elaborate the connection between theoretical positions from social psychology with recent studies from computer science on prejudice embedded in natural language.",2021,Oct,Cognition,215,,104813,,10.1016/j.cognition.2021.104813,34192608,#4428,Li 2021,"",""
Social media surveillance for perceived therapeutic effects of cannabidiol (CBD) products.,Tran T; Kavuluru R,"BACKGROUND: CBD products have risen in popularity given CBD's therapeutic potential and lack of legal oversight, despite lacking conclusive scientific evidence for widespread over-the-counter usage for many of its perceived benefits. While medical evidence is being generated, social media surveillance offers a fast and inexpensive alternative to traditional surveys in ascertaining perceived therapeutic purposes and modes of consumption for CBD products. METHODS: We collected all comments from the CBD subreddit posted between January 1 and April 30, 2019 as well as comments submitted to the FDA regarding regulation of cannabis-derived products and analyzed them using a rule-based language processing method. A relative ranking of popular therapeutic uses and product groups for CBD is obtained based on frequency of pattern matches including precise queries that entail identifying mentions of the condition, a CBD product, and some ""trigger"" phrase indicating therapeutic use. We validated the social media-based findings using a similar analysis on comments to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) 2019 request-for-comments on cannabis-derived products. RESULTS: CBD is mostly discussed as a remedy for anxiety disorders and pain and this is consistent across both comment sources. Of comments posted to the CBD subreddit during the monitored time span, 6.19% mentioned anxiety at least once with at least 6.02% of these comments specifically mentioning CBD as a treatment for anxiety (i.e., 0.37% of total comments). The most popular CBD product group is oil and tinctures. CONCLUSION: Social media surveillance of CBD usage has the potential to surface new therapeutic use-cases as they are posted. Contemporary social media data indicate, for example, that stress and nausea are frequently mentioned as therapeutic use cases for CBD without corresponding evidence, that affirms or denies, in the research literature. However, the abundance of anecdotal claims warrants serious scientific exploration moving forward.

The Psychosocial Impacts of COVID-19 on a Sample of Australian Adults: Cross-sectional Survey and Sentiment Analysis.,Ryan J; Sellak H; Brindal E,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has had enormous impacts on people's lives, including disruptions to their normal ways of behaving, working, and interacting with others. Understanding and documenting these experiences is important to inform the ongoing response to COVID-19 and disaster preparedness efforts. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the psychosocial impacts of COVID-19 on a sample of Australian adults. METHODS: The data analyzed were derived from a larger cross-sectional survey of Australian adults that was administered during the month of May 2020. Participants (N=3483) were asked in which ways COVID-19 had most greatly impacted them; the responses produced a text data set containing 1 COVID-19 impact story for each participant, totaling 86,642 words. Participants also completed assessments of their sociodemographic characteristics (sex, age, financial stress), level of concern related to COVID-19, personality trait profile, and satisfaction with life. Impact stories were analyzed using sentiment analysis and compared against the Theoretical Domains Framework to determine the most frequently impacted life domains. Finally, a multinomial regression analysis, stratified by participant sex, was conducted to identify the associations of psychological and demographic socializations with sentiment toward COVID-19. RESULTS: In total, 3483 participants completed the survey, the majority of whom were female (n=2793, 80.2%). Participants' impact stories were most commonly categorized as neutral (1544/3483, 44.3%), followed by negative (1136/3483, 32.6%) and positive (802/3483, 23.1%). The most frequently impacted life domains included behavioral regulation, environmental context and resources, social influences, and emotions, suggesting that the COVID-19 pandemic was impacting these areas of participants' lives the most. Finally, the regression results suggested that for women, lower satisfaction with life and higher financial stress were associated with increased likelihood of negative, rather than positive, sentiment (P<.001); however, the proportion of variance in the sentiment that was explained was very small (<5%). CONCLUSIONS: Participant sentiment toward COVID-19 varied. High rates of neutral and negative sentiment were identified. Positive sentiment was identified but was not as common. Impacts to different areas of people's lives were identified, with a major emphasis on behavioral regulation and related domains such as social influences, environmental context and resources, and emotions.

Multimodal Automatic Coding of Client Behavior in Motivational Interviewing.,Tavabi L; Borsari B; Stefanov K; Woolley JD; Soleymani M; Zhang L; Scherer S,"Motivational Interviewing (MI) is defined as a collaborative conversation style that evokes the client's own intrinsic reasons for behavioral change. In MI research, the clients' attitude (willingness or resistance) toward change as expressed through language, has been identified as an important indicator of their subsequent behavior change. Automated coding of these indicators provides systematic and efficient means for the analysis and assessment of MI therapy sessions. In this paper, we study and analyze behavioral cues in client language and speech that bear indications of the client's behavior toward change during a therapy session, using a database of dyadic motivational interviews between therapists and clients with alcohol-related problems. Deep language and voice encoders, i.e., BERT and VGGish, trained on large amounts of data are used to extract features from each utterance. We develop a neural network to automatically detect the MI codes using both the clients' and therapists' language and clients' voice, and demonstrate the importance of semantic context in such detection. Additionally, we develop machine learning models for predicting alcohol-use behavioral outcomes of clients through language and voice analysis. Our analysis demonstrates that we are able to estimate MI codes using clients' textual utterances along with preceding textual context from both the therapist and client, reaching an F1-score of 0.72 for a speaker-independent three-class classification.

Fine-tuned Sentiment Analysis of COVID-19 Vaccine-Related Social Media Data: Comparative Study.,Melton CA; White BM; Davis RL; Bednarczyk RA; Shaban-Nejad A,"BACKGROUND: The emergence of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and the necessary separation of populations have led to an unprecedented number of new social media users seeking information related to the pandemic. Currently, with an estimated 4.5 billion users worldwide, social media data offer an opportunity for near real-time analysis of large bodies of text related to disease outbreaks and vaccination. These analyses can be used by officials to develop appropriate public health messaging, digital interventions, educational materials, and policies. OBJECTIVE: Our study investigated and compared public sentiment related to COVID-19 vaccines expressed on 2 popular social media platforms-Reddit and Twitter-harvested from January 1, 2020, to March 1, 2022. METHODS: To accomplish this task, we created a fine-tuned DistilRoBERTa model to predict the sentiments of approximately 9.5 million tweets and 70 thousand Reddit comments. To fine-tune our model, our team manually labeled the sentiment of 3600 tweets and then augmented our data set through back-translation. Text sentiment for each social media platform was then classified with our fine-tuned model using Python programming language and the Hugging Face sentiment analysis pipeline. RESULTS: Our results determined that the average sentiment expressed on Twitter was more negative (5,215,830/9,518,270, 54.8%) than positive, and the sentiment expressed on Reddit was more positive (42,316/67,962, 62.3%) than negative. Although the average sentiment was found to vary between these social media platforms, both platforms displayed similar behavior related to the sentiment shared at key vaccine-related developments during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Considering this similar trend in shared sentiment demonstrated across social media platforms, Twitter and Reddit continue to be valuable data sources that public health officials can use to strengthen vaccine confidence and combat misinformation. As the spread of misinformation poses a range of psychological and psychosocial risks (anxiety and fear, etc), there is an urgency in understanding the public perspective and attitude toward shared falsities. Comprehensive educational delivery systems tailored to a population's expressed sentiments that facilitate digital literacy, health information-seeking behavior, and precision health promotion could aid in clarifying such misinformation.",2022,Oct,J Med Internet Res,24,10,e40408,,10.2196/40408,36174192,#4464,Melton 2022,"",""
Cross-Cultural Polarity and Emotion Detection Using Sentiment Analysis and Deep Learning on COVID-19 Related Tweets.,Imran AS; Daudpota SM; Kastrati Z; Batra R,"How different cultures react and respond given a crisis is predominant in a society's norms and political will to combat the situation.

Using Twitter to Understand the Human Bowel Disease Community: Exploratory Analysis of Key Topics.,Pérez-Pérez M; Pérez-Rodríguez G; Fdez-Riverola F; Lourenço A,"BACKGROUND: Nowadays, the use of social media is part of daily life, with more and more people, including governments and health organizations, using at least one platform regularly. Social media enables users to interact among large groups of people that share the same interests and suffer the same afflictions. Notably, these channels promote the ability to find and share information about health and medical conditions. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to characterize the bowel disease (BD) community on Twitter, in particular how patients understand, discuss, feel, and react to the condition. The main questions were as follows: Which are the main communities and most influential users?; Where are the main content providers from?; What are the key biomedical and scientific topics under discussion? How are topics interrelated in patient communications?; How do external events influence user activity?; What kind of external sources of information are being promoted? METHODS: To answer these questions, a dataset of tweets containing terms related to BD conditions was collected from February to August 2018, accounting for a total of 24,634 tweets from 13,295 different users. Tweet preprocessing entailed the extraction of textual contents, hyperlinks, hashtags, time, location, and user information. Missing and incomplete information about the user profiles was completed using different analysis techniques. Semantic tweet topic analysis was supported by a lexicon-based entity recognizer. Furthermore, sentiment analysis enabled a closer look into the opinions expressed in the tweets, namely, gaining a deeper understanding of patients' feelings and experiences. RESULTS: Health organizations received most of the communication, whereas BD patients and experts in bowel conditions and nutrition were among those tweeting the most. In general, the BD community was mainly discussing symptoms, BD-related diseases, and diet-based treatments. Diarrhea and constipation were the most commonly mentioned symptoms, and cancer, anxiety disorder, depression, and chronic inflammations were frequently part of BD-related tweets. Most patient tweets discussed the bad side of BD conditions and other related conditions, namely, depression, diarrhea, and fibromyalgia. In turn, gluten-free diets and probiotic supplements were often mentioned in patient tweets expressing positive emotions. However, for the most part, tweets containing mentions to foods and diets showed a similar distribution of negative and positive sentiments because the effects of certain food components (eg, fiber, iron, and magnesium) were perceived differently, depending on the state of the disease and other personal conditions of the patients. The benefits of medical cannabis for the treatment of different chronic diseases were also highlighted. CONCLUSIONS: This study evidences that Twitter is becoming an influential space for conversation about bowel conditions, namely, patient opinions about associated symptoms and treatments. So, further qualitative and quantitative content analyses hold the potential to support decision making among health-related stakeholders, including the planning of awareness campaigns.",2019,Aug,J Med Internet Res,21,8,e12610,,10.2196/12610,31411142,#4468,Pérez-Pérez 2019,"",""
Mining long-COVID symptoms from Reddit: characterizing post-COVID syndrome from patient reports.,Sarker A; Ge Y,"Our objective was to mine Reddit to discover long-COVID symptoms self-reported by users, compare symptom distributions across studies, and create a symptom lexicon. We retrieved posts from the /r/covidlonghaulers subreddit and extracted symptoms via approximate matching using an expanded meta-lexicon. We mapped the extracted symptoms to standard concept IDs, compared their distributions with those reported in recent literature and analyzed their distributions over time. From 42 995 posts by 4249 users, we identified 1744 users who expressed at least 1 symptom. The most frequently reported long-COVID symptoms were mental health-related symptoms (55.2%), fatigue (51.2%), general ache/pain (48.4%), brain fog/confusion (32.8%), and dyspnea (28.9%) among users reporting at least 1 symptom. Comparison with recent literature revealed a large variance in reported symptoms across studies. Temporal analysis showed several persistent symptoms up to 15 months after infection.

Semantic Linkages of Obsessions From an International Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Mobile App Data Set: Big Data Analytics Study.,Feusner JD; Mohideen R; Smith S; Patanam I; Vaitla A; Lam C; Massi M; Leow A,"BACKGROUND: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by recurrent intrusive thoughts, urges, or images (obsessions) and repetitive physical or mental behaviors (compulsions). Previous factor analytic and clustering studies suggest the presence of three or four subtypes of OCD symptoms. However, these studies have relied on predefined symptom checklists, which are limited in breadth and may be biased toward researchers' previous conceptualizations of OCD. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we examine a large data set of freely reported obsession symptoms obtained from an OCD mobile app as an alternative to uncovering potential OCD subtypes. From this, we examine data-driven clusters of obsessions based on their latent semantic relationships in the English language using word embeddings. METHODS: We extracted free-text entry words describing obsessions in a large sample of users of a mobile app, NOCD. Semantic vector space modeling was applied using the Global Vectors for Word Representation algorithm. A domain-specific extension, Mittens, was also applied to enhance the corpus with OCD-specific words. The resulting representations provided linear substructures of the word vector in a 100-dimensional space. We applied principal component analysis to the 100-dimensional vector representation of the most frequent words, followed by k-means clustering to obtain clusters of related words. RESULTS: We obtained 7001 unique words representing obsessions from 25,369 individuals. Heuristics for determining the optimal number of clusters pointed to a three-cluster solution for grouping subtypes of OCD. The first had themes relating to relationship and just-right; the second had themes relating to doubt and checking; and the third had themes relating to contamination, somatic, physical harm, and sexual harm. All three clusters showed close semantic relationships with each other in the central area of convergence, with themes relating to harm. An equal-sized split-sample analysis across individuals and a split-sample analysis over time both showed overall stable cluster solutions. Words in the third cluster were the most frequently occurring words, followed by words in the first cluster. CONCLUSIONS: The clustering of naturally acquired obsessional words resulted in three major groupings of semantic themes, which partially overlapped with predefined checklists from previous studies. Furthermore, the closeness of the overall embedded relationships across clusters and their central convergence on harm suggests that, at least at the level of self-reported obsessional thoughts, most obsessions have close semantic relationships. Harm to self or others may be an underlying organizing theme across many obsessions. Notably, relationship-themed words, not previously included in factor-analytic studies, clustered with just-right words. These novel insights have potential implications for understanding how an apparent multitude of obsessional symptoms are connected by underlying themes. This observation could aid exposure-based treatment approaches and could be used as a conceptual framework for future research.",2021,Jun,J Med Internet Res,23,6,e25482,,10.2196/25482,33892466,#4481,Feusner 2021,"",""
Machine Learning Model to Predict Assignment of Therapy Homework in Behavioral Treatments: Algorithm Development and Validation.,Peretz G; Taylor CB; Ruzek JI; Jefroykin S; Sadeh-Sharvit S,"BACKGROUND: Therapeutic homework is a core element of cognitive and behavioral interventions, and greater homework compliance predicts improved treatment outcomes. To date, research in this area has relied mostly on therapists' and clients' self-reports or studies carried out in academic settings, and there is little knowledge on how homework is used as a treatment intervention in routine clinical care. OBJECTIVE: This study tested whether a machine learning (ML) model using natural language processing could identify homework assignments in behavioral health sessions. By leveraging this technology, we sought to develop a more objective and accurate method for detecting the presence of homework in therapy sessions. METHODS: We analyzed 34,497 audio-recorded treatment sessions provided in 8 behavioral health care programs via an artificial intelligence (AI) platform designed for therapy provided by Eleos Health. Therapist and client utterances were captured and analyzed via the AI platform. Experts reviewed the homework assigned in 100 sessions to create classifications. Next, we sampled 4000 sessions and labeled therapist-client microdialogues that suggested homework to train an unsupervised sentence embedding model. This model was trained on 2.83 million therapist-client microdialogues. RESULTS: An analysis of 100 random sessions found that homework was assigned in 61% (n=61) of sessions, and in 34% (n=21) of these cases, more than one homework assignment was provided. Homework addressed practicing skills (n=34, 37%), taking action (n=26, 28.5%), journaling (n=17, 19%), and learning new skills (n=14, 15%). Our classifier reached a 72% F(1)-score, outperforming state-of-the-art ML models. The therapists reviewing the microdialogues agreed in 90% (n=90) of cases on whether or not homework was assigned. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study demonstrate the potential of ML and natural language processing to improve the detection of therapeutic homework assignments in behavioral health sessions. Our findings highlight the importance of accurately capturing homework in real-world settings and the potential for AI to support therapists in providing evidence-based care and increasing fidelity with science-backed interventions. By identifying areas where AI can facilitate homework assignments and tracking, such as reminding therapists to prescribe homework and reducing the charting associated with homework, we can ultimately improve the overall quality of behavioral health care. Additionally, our approach can be extended to investigate the impact of homework assignments on therapeutic outcomes, providing insights into the effectiveness of specific types of homework.",2023,May,JMIR Form Res,7,,e45156,,10.2196/45156,37184927,#4486,Peretz 2023,"",""
A Comparison Between Clinical Guidelines and Real-World Treatment Data in Examining the Use of Session Summaries: Retrospective Study.,Sadeh-Sharvit S; Rego SA; Jefroykin S; Peretz G; Kupershmidt T,"BACKGROUND: Although behavioral interventions have been found to be efficacious and effective in randomized clinical trials for most mental illnesses, the quality and efficacy of mental health care delivery remains inadequate in real-world settings, partly owing to suboptimal treatment fidelity. This ""therapist drift"" is an ongoing issue that ultimately reduces the effectiveness of treatments; however, until recently, there have been limited opportunities to assess adherence beyond large randomized controlled trials. OBJECTIVE: This study explored therapists' use of a standard component that is pertinent across most behavioral treatments-prompting clients to summarize their treatment session as a means for consolidating and augmenting their understanding of the session and the treatment plan. METHODS: The data set for this study comprised 17,607 behavioral treatment sessions administered by 322 therapists to 3519 patients in 37 behavioral health care programs across the United States. Sessions were captured by a therapy-specific artificial intelligence (AI) platform, and an automatic speech recognition system transcribed the treatment meeting and separated the data to the therapist and client utterances. A search for possible session summary prompts was then conducted, with 2 psychologists validating the text that emerged. RESULTS: We found that despite clinical recommendations, only 54 (0.30%) sessions included a summary. Exploratory analyses indicated that session summaries mostly addressed relationships (n=27), work (n=20), change (n=6), and alcohol (n=5). Sessions with meeting summaries were also characterized by greater therapist interventions and included greater use of validation, complex reflections, and proactive problem-solving techniques. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to assess a large, diverse data set of real-world treatment practices. Our findings provide evidence that fidelity with the core components of empirically designed psychological interventions is a challenge in real-world settings. The results of this study can inform the development of machine learning and AI algorithms and offer nuanced, timely feedback to providers, thereby improving the delivery of evidence-based practices and quality of mental health care services and facilitating better clinical outcomes in real-world settings.",2022,Aug,JMIR Form Res,6,8,e39846,,10.2196/39846,35972782,#4493,Sadeh-Sharvit 2022,"",""
"Loneliness in older adult mental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic and before: Associations with disability, functioning and pharmacotherapy.",Greig F; Perera G; Tsamakis K; Stewart R; Velayudhan L; Mueller C,"OBJECTIVES: Loneliness is associated with psychiatric morbidity. Restrictions placed on the population during the first COVID-19 lockdown may have disproportionately affected older adults, possibly through increasing loneliness. We sought to investigate this by examining loneliness in referrals to mental health of older adults (MHOA) services during the first UK COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: Referrals to MHOA services from a large South London catchment area were identified for the 16-week period of the UK lockdown starting in March 2020 and for the corresponding period in 2019. A natural language processing algorithm identified loneliness in the patients' records. We applied logistic regression models adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity and diagnosis, to examine associations of loneliness in the study population. RESULTS: 1991 referrals were identified, 56.9% of whom were female, with a mean age of 77.9 years. Only 26.9% occurred during the 2020 lockdown, but with a higher prevalence of loneliness (22.0 vs. 17.7%, p = 0.028). In the whole sample, loneliness was associated with non-accidental self-injury (Odds ratio [OR]: 1.65), depressed mood (OR: 1.73), psychotic symptoms (OR: 1.65), relationship problems (OR: 1.49), problems with daytime activities (OR: 1.36), and antidepressant use (OR: 2.11). During lockdown, loneliness was associated with non-accidental self-injury (OR: 2.52), problem drinking or drug-taking (OR 2.33), and antidepressant use (OR 2.10). CONCLUSIONS: Loneliness is associated with more severe symptoms of affective illness, worse functional problems and increased use of antidepressant medication in older adults. During lockdown, loneliness in referrals to MHOA services increased and was associated with increased risk-taking behaviour. Loneliness is a potential modifiable risk factor for mental illness, and efforts to minimise it in older adults should be prioritised as we emerge from the pandemic.",2021,Oct,Int J Geriatr Psychiatry,37,1,,,10.1002/gps.5630,34614534,#4494,Greig 2021,"",""

We assessed the US publics early experience with the COVID-19 crisis during the period when shelter-in-place orders were widely implemented to understand non-compliance with those orders, sentiment about the crisis, and to compare across age categories associated with different levels of risk. We posted our survey on Twitter, Facebook, and NextDoor on March 14th to March 23rd that included 21 questions including demographics, impact on daily life, actions taken, and difficulties faced. We analyzed the free-text responses to the impact question using LIWC, a computational natural language processing tool, and performed a thematic content analysis of the reasons people gave for non-compliance with social distancing orders. Stanford Universitys IRB approved the study. In 9 days, we collected a total of 20,734 responses. 6,573 individuals provided a response (≥30 words) to the question, Tell us how the coronavirus crisis is impacting your life. Our data (Figure 1) show that younger people (18-31) are more emotionally negative, self-centered, and less concerned with family, while middle-aged people are group-oriented (32-44) and focused on family (32-64) (all p values < .05 corrected for multiple comparisons). Unsurprisingly, the oldest and most at-risk group (65+) are more focused on biological terms (e.g., health-related topics), but were surprisingly low in anxiety and high in emotionally positive terms relative to those at lower risk. We also content-analyzed 7,355 responses (kappas > .75) to the question, What are the reasons you are not self-isolating more? Of these participants, 39.8% reported not being compliant, with the youngest group (18-31) having the lowest compliance rate (52.4%) compared to the other age groups (all > 60%; all p values < .01). Table 1 describes the seven primary themes for non-compliance. Non-essential work requirements, concerns about mental and physical health, and the belief that other precautions were sufficient were the most common reasons, although other rationales included wanting to continue everyday activities and beliefs that society is over-reacting. Childcare was an important concern for a subset of respondents. Overall, our findings suggest that public health messages should focus on young people and 1) address their negative affect, 2) refocus their self-orientation by emphasizing the importance of individual behavior to group-level health outcomes, and 3) target the specific rationales that different people have regarding the pandemic to maximize compliance with social distancing.",2020,Apr,medRxiv,,,,,10.1101/2020.04.08.20057067,32511643,#4501,Moore 2020,"",""
Experiences of Siblings of Children With Neurodevelopmental Disorders: Comparing Qualitative Analysis and Machine Learning to Study Narratives.,Bastiaansen JAJ; Veldhuizen EE; De Schepper K; Scheepers FE,"INTRODUCTION: Relatively few studies have focused on the wellbeing, experiences and needs of the siblings of children with a psychiatric diagnosis. However, the studies that have been conducted suggest that the impact of such circumstances on these siblings is significant. Studying narratives of diagnosed children or relatives has proven to be a successful approach to gain insights that could help improve care. Only a few attempts have been made to study narratives in psychiatry utilizing a machine learning approach. METHOD: In this current study, 13 narratives of the experiences of siblings of children with a neurodevelopmental disorders were collected through largely unstructured interviews. The interviews were analyzed using the traditional qualitative, hermeneutic phenomenology method as well as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), an unsupervised machine learning method clustering words from documents into topics. One aim of this study was to evaluate the experiences of the siblings in order to find leads to improve care and support for these siblings. Furthermore, the outcomes of both analyses were compared to evaluate the role of machine learning in analyzing narratives. RESULTS: Qualitative analysis of the interviews led to the formulation of nine main themes: confrontation with conflicts, coping strategies siblings, need for rest and time for myself, need for support and attention from personal circle, wish for normality, influence on personal choices and possibilities for development, doing things together, recommendations and advices, ambivalence and loyalty. Using unsupervised machine learning (LDA) 24 topics were formed that mostly overlapped with the qualitative themes found. Both the qualitative analysis and the LDA analysis detected themes that were unique to the respective analysis. CONCLUSION: The present study found that studying narratives of siblings of children with a neurodevelopmental disorder contributes to a better understanding of the subjects' experiences. Siblings cope with ambivalent feelings toward their brother or sister and this emotional conflict often leads to adapted behavior. Several coping strategies are developed to deal with the behavior of their brother or sister like seeking support or ignoring. Devoted support, time and attention from close relatives, especially parents, is needed. The LDA analysis didn't appear useful to distract meaning and context from the narratives, but it was proposed that machine learning could be a valuable and quick addition to the traditional qualitative methods by finding overlooked topics and giving a rudimental overview of topics in narratives.",2022,,Front Psychiatry,13,,719598,,10.3389/fpsyt.2022.719598,35573373,#4505,BastiaansenJAJ 2022,"",""
Cultural Differences in Tweeting about Drinking Across the US.,Giorgi S; Yaden DB; Eichstaedt JC; Ashford RD; Buffone AEK; Schwartz HA; Ungar LH; Curtis B,"Excessive alcohol use in the US contributes to over 88,000 deaths per year and costs over $250 billion annually. While previous studies have shown that excessive alcohol use can be detected from general patterns of social media engagement, we characterized how drinking-specific language varies across regions and cultures in the US. From a database of 38 billion public tweets, we selected those mentioning ""drunk"", found the words and phrases distinctive of drinking posts, and then clustered these into topics and sets of semantically related words. We identified geolocated ""drunk"" tweets and correlated their language with the prevalence of self-reported excessive alcohol consumption (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System; BRFSS). We then identified linguistic markers associated with excessive drinking in different regions and cultural communities as identified by the American Community Project. ""Drunk"" tweet frequency (of the 3.3 million geolocated ""drunk"" tweets) correlated with excessive alcohol consumption at both the county and state levels (r = 0.26 and 0.45, respectively, p < 0.01). Topic analyses revealed that excessive alcohol consumption was most correlated with references to drinking with friends (r = 0.20), family (r = 0.15), and driving under the influence (r = 0.14). Using the American Community Project classification, we found a number of cultural markers of drinking: religious communities had a high frequency of anti-drunk driving tweets, Hispanic centers discussed family members drinking, and college towns discussed sexual behavior. This study shows that Twitter can be used to explore the specific sociocultural contexts in which excessive alcohol use occurs within particular regions and communities. These findings can inform more targeted public health messaging and help to better understand cultural determinants of substance abuse.",2020,Feb,Int J Environ Res Public Health,17,4,,,10.3390/ijerph17041125,32053866,#4513,Giorgi 2020,"",""

Exploring the Suicide Mechanism Path of High-Suicide-Risk Adolescents-Based on Weibo Text Analysis.,Mo L; Li H; Zhu T,"BACKGROUND: Adolescent suicide can have serious consequences for individuals, families and society, so we should pay attention to it. As social media becomes a platform for adolescents to share their daily lives and express their emotions, online identification and intervention of adolescent suicide problems become possible. In order to find the suicide mechanism path of high-suicide-risk adolescents, we explore the factors that influence is, especially the relations between psychological pain, hopelessness and suicide stages. METHODS: We identified high-suicide-risk adolescents through machine learning model identification and manual identification, and used the Weibo text analysis method to explore the suicide mechanism path of high-suicide-risk adolescents. RESULTS: Qualitative analysis showed that 36.2% of high-suicide-risk adolescents suffered from mental illness, and depression accounted for 76.3% of all mental illnesses. The mediating effect analysis showed that hopelessness played a complete mediating role between psychological pain and suicide stages. In addition, hopelessness was significantly negatively correlated with suicide stages. CONCLUSION: mental illness (especially depression) in high-suicide-risk adolescents is closely related to suicide stages, the later the suicide stage, the higher the diagnosis rate of mental illness. The suicide mechanism path in high-suicide-risk adolescents is: psychological pain→ hopelessness → suicide stages, indicating that psychological pain mainly affects suicide risk through hopelessness.

The aim of this study was to (a) develop interactive active machine-learning model training methodology using readily available software that was (b) easily adaptable to a wide range of natural language databases and allowed customised researcher-defined categories, and then (c) evaluate the accuracy and speed of this model for classifying free text from two unique and unrelated clinical notes into coded data. A user interface for medical experts to train and evaluate the algorithm was created. Data requiring coding in the form of two independent databases of free-text clinical notes, each of unique natural language structure. Medical experts defined categories relevant to research projects and performed 'label-train-evaluate' loops on the training data set. A separate dataset was used for validation, with the medical experts blinded to the label given by the algorithm. The first dataset was 32,034 death certificate records from Northern Territory Births Deaths and Marriages, which were coded into 3 categories: haemorrhagic stroke, ischaemic stroke or no stroke. The second dataset was 12,039 recorded episodes of aeromedical retrieval from two prehospital and retrieval services in Northern Territory, Australia, which were coded into 5 categories: medical, surgical, trauma, obstetric or psychiatric. For the first dataset, macro-accuracy of the algorithm was 94.7%. For the second dataset, macro-accuracy was 92.4%. The time taken to develop and train the algorithm was 124 minutes for the death certificate coding, and 144 minutes for the aeromedical retrieval coding.

Benchmarking Transformer-Based Models for Identifying Social Determinants of Health in Clinical Notes.,Wang X; Gupta D; Killian M; He Z,"Electronic health records (EHR) have been widely used in building machine learning models for health outcomes prediction. However, many EHR-based models are inherently biased due to lack of risk factors on social determinants of health (SDoH), which are responsible for up to 40% preventive deaths. As SDoH information is often captured in clinical notes, recent efforts have been made to extract such information from notes with natural language processing and append it to other structured data. In this work, we benchmark 7 pre-trained transformer-based models, including BERT, ALBERT, BioBERT, BioClinicalBERT, RoBERTa, ELECTRA, and RoBERTa-MIMIC-Trial, for recognizing SDoH terms using a previously annotated corpus of MIMIC-III clinical notes.

Automatic Depression Detection Using Smartphone-Based Text-Dependent Speech Signals: Deep Convolutional Neural Network Approach.,Kim AY; Jang EH; Lee SH; Choi KY; Park JG; Shin HC,"BACKGROUND: Automatic diagnosis of depression based on speech can complement mental health treatment methods in the future. Previous studies have reported that acoustic properties can be used to identify depression. However, few studies have attempted a large-scale differential diagnosis of patients with depressive disorders using acoustic characteristics of non-English speakers. OBJECTIVE: This study proposes a framework for automatic depression detection using large-scale acoustic characteristics based on the Korean language. METHODS: We recruited 153 patients who met the criteria for major depressive disorder and 165 healthy controls without current or past mental illness. Participants' voices were recorded on a smartphone while performing the task of reading predefined text-based sentences. Three approaches were evaluated and compared to detect depression using data sets with text-dependent read speech tasks: conventional machine learning models based on acoustic features, a proposed model that trains and classifies log-Mel spectrograms by applying a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with a relatively small number of parameters, and models that train and classify log-Mel spectrograms by applying well-known pretrained networks. RESULTS: The acoustic characteristics of the predefined text-based sentence reading automatically detected depression using the proposed CNN model. The highest accuracy achieved with the proposed CNN on the speech data was 78.14%. Our results show that the deep-learned acoustic characteristics lead to better performance than those obtained using the conventional approach and pretrained models. CONCLUSIONS: Checking the mood of patients with major depressive disorder and detecting the consistency of objective descriptions are very important research topics. This study suggests that the analysis of speech data recorded while reading text-dependent sentences could help predict depression status automatically by capturing the characteristics of depression. Our method is smartphone based, is easily accessible, and can contribute to the automatic identification of depressive states.",2023,Jan,J Med Internet Res,25,,e34474,,10.2196/34474,36696160,#4636,Kim 2023,"",""
Extracting psychiatric stressors for suicide from social media using deep learning.,Du J; Zhang Y; Luo J; Jia Y; Wei Q; Tao C; Xu H,"BACKGROUND: Suicide has been one of the leading causes of deaths in the United States. One major cause of suicide is psychiatric stressors. The detection of psychiatric stressors in an at risk population will facilitate the early prevention of suicidal behaviors and suicide. In recent years, the widespread popularity and real-time information sharing flow of social media allow potential early intervention in a large-scale population. However, few automated approaches have been proposed to extract psychiatric stressors from Twitter. The goal of this study was to investigate techniques for recognizing suicide related psychiatric stressors from Twitter using deep learning based methods and transfer learning strategy which leverages an existing annotation dataset from clinical text. METHODS: First, a dataset of suicide-related tweets was collected from Twitter streaming data with a multiple-step pipeline including keyword-based retrieving, filtering and further refining using an automated binary classifier. Specifically, a convolutional neural networks (CNN) based algorithm was used to build the binary classifier. Next, psychiatric stressors were annotated in the suicide-related tweets. The stressor recognition problem is conceptualized as a typical named entity recognition (NER) task and tackled using recurrent neural networks (RNN) based methods. Moreover, to reduce the annotation cost and improve the performance, transfer learning strategy was adopted by leveraging existing annotation from clinical text. RESULTS & CONCLUSIONS: To our best knowledge, this is the first effort to extract psychiatric stressors from Twitter data using deep learning based approaches. Comparison to traditional machine learning algorithms shows the superiority of deep learning based approaches. CNN is leading the performance at identifying suicide-related tweets with a precision of 78% and an F-1 measure of 83%, outperforming Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extra Trees (ET), etc. RNN based psychiatric stressors recognition obtains the best F-1 measure of 53.25% by exact match and 67.94% by inexact match, outperforming Conditional Random Fields (CRF). Moreover, transfer learning from clinical notes for the Twitter corpus outperforms the training with Twitter corpus only with an F-1 measure of 54.9% by exact match.

Classifying clinical notes with pain assessment using machine learning.,Fodeh SJ; Finch D; Bouayad L; Luther SL; Ling H; Kerns RD; Brandt C,"Pain is a significant public health problem, affecting millions of people in the USA. Evidence has highlighted that patients with chronic pain often suffer from deficits in pain care quality (PCQ) including pain assessment, treatment, and reassessment. Currently, there is no intelligent and reliable approach to identify PCQ indicators inelectronic health records (EHR). Hereby, we used unstructured text narratives in the EHR to derive pain assessment in clinical notes for patients with chronic pain. Our dataset includes patients with documented pain intensity rating ratings > = 4 and initial musculoskeletal diagnoses (MSD) captured by (ICD-9-CM codes) in fiscal year 2011 and a minimal 1 year of follow-up (follow-up period is 3-yr maximum); with complete data on key demographic variables. A total of 92 patients with 1058 notes was used. First, we manually annotated qualifiers and descriptors of pain assessment using the annotation schema that we previously developed. Second, we developed a reliable classifier for indicators of pain assessment in clinical note. Based on our annotation schema, we found variations in documenting the subclasses of pain assessment. In positive notes, providers mostly documented assessment of pain site (67%) and intensity of pain (57%), followed by persistence (32%). In only 27% of positive notes, did providers document a presumed etiology for the pain complaint or diagnosis. Documentation of patients' reports of factors that aggravate pain was only present in 11% of positive notes. Random forest classifier achieved the best performance labeling clinical notes with pain assessment information, compared to other classifiers; 94, 95, 94, and 94% was observed in terms of accuracy, PPV, F1-score, and AUC, respectively. Despite the wide spectrum of research that utilizes machine learning in many clinical applications, none explored using these methods for pain assessment research. In addition, previous studies using large datasets to detect and analyze characteristics of patients with various types of pain have relied exclusively on billing and coded data as the main source of information. This study, in contrast, harnessed unstructured narrative text data from the EHR to detect pain assessment clinical notes.

However, text available for training word embeddings for ASD is miniscule compared to the billions of tokens typically used. We evaluate the importance of corpus specificity versus size and hypothesize that for specific domains small corpora can generate excellent word embeddings. We custom-built 6 ASD-themed corpora (N=4482), using ASD EHRs and abstracts from PubMed (N=39K) and PsychInfo (N=69K) and evaluated them. We were able to generate the most useful 200-dimension embeddings based on the small ASD EHR data.

Boosting Delirium Identification Accuracy With Sentiment-Based Natural Language Processing: Mixed Methods Study.,Wang L; Zhang Y; Chignell M; Shan B; Sheehan KA; Razak F; Verma A,"BACKGROUND: Delirium is an acute neurocognitive disorder that affects up to half of older hospitalized medical patients and can lead to dementia, longer hospital stays, increased health costs, and death. Although delirium can be prevented and treated, it is difficult to identify and predict. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to improve machine learning models that retrospectively identify the presence of delirium during hospital stays (eg, to measure the effectiveness of delirium prevention interventions) by using the natural language processing (NLP) technique of sentiment analysis (in this case a feature that identifies sentiment toward, or away from, a delirium diagnosis). METHODS: Using data from the General Medicine Inpatient Initiative, a Canadian hospital data and analytics network, a detailed manual review of medical records was conducted from nearly 4000 admissions at 6 Toronto area hospitals. Furthermore, 25.74% (994/3862) of the eligible hospital admissions were labeled as having delirium. Using the data set collected from this study, we developed machine learning models with, and without, the benefit of NLP methods applied to diagnostic imaging reports, and we asked the question ""can NLP improve machine learning identification of delirium?"" RESULTS: Among the eligible 3862 hospital admissions, 994 (25.74%) admissions were labeled as having delirium. Identification and calibration of the models were satisfactory. The accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the main model with NLP in the independent testing data set were 0.807 and 0.930, respectively. The accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the main model without NLP in the independent testing data set were 0.811 and 0.869, respectively.

OBJECTIVE: To automate the classification of deaths related to substances in medical examiner data using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Diagnostic study comparing different natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to identify substances related to overdose in 10 health jurisdictions in the US from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020. Unstructured text from 35 433 medical examiner and coroners' death records was examined. EXPOSURES: Text from each case was manually classified to a substance that was related to the death. Three feature representation methods were used and compared: text frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), global vectors for word representations (GloVe), and concept unique identifier (CUI) embeddings. Several ML algorithms were trained and best models were selected based on F-scores. The best models were tested on a hold-out test set and results were reported with 95% CIs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Text data from death certificates were classified as any opioid, fentanyl, alcohol, cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, prescription opioid, and an aggregate of other substances. Diagnostic metrics and 95% CIs were calculated for each combination of feature extraction method and machine learning classifier. RESULTS: Of 35 433 death records analyzed (decedent median age, 58 years [IQR, 41-72 years]; 24 449 [69%] were male), the most common substances related to deaths included any opioid (5739 [16%]), fentanyl (4758 [13%]), alcohol (2866 [8%]), cocaine (2247 [6%]), methamphetamine (1876 [5%]), heroin (1613 [5%]), prescription opioids (1197 [3%]), and any benzodiazepine (1076 [3%]).

Prevalence and risk factors analysis of postpartum depression at early stage using hybrid deep learning model.,Lilhore UK; Dalal S; Varshney N; Sharma YK; Rao KBVB; Rao VVRM; Alroobaea R; Simaiya S; Margala M; Chakrabarti P,"Postpartum Depression Disorder (PPDD) is a prevalent mental health condition and results in severe depression and suicide attempts in the social community. Prompt actions are crucial in tackling PPDD, which requires a quick recognition and accurate analysis of the probability factors associated with this condition. This concern requires attention. The primary aim of our research is to investigate the feasibility of anticipating an individual's mental state by categorizing individuals with depression from those without depression using a dataset consisting of text along with audio recordings from patients diagnosed with PPDD. This research proposes a hybrid PPDD framework that combines Improved Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (IBi-LSTM) with Transfer Learning (TL) based on two Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, respectively CNN-text and CNN audio. In the proposed model, the CNN section efficiently utilizes TL to obtain crucial knowledge from text and audio characteristics, whereas the improved Bi-LSTM module combines written material and sound data to obtain intricate chronological interpersonal relationships. The proposed model incorporates an attention technique to augment the effectiveness of the Bi-LSTM scheme. An experimental analysis is conducted on the PPDD online textual and speech audio dataset collected from UCI. It includes textual features such as age, women's health tracks, medical histories, demographic information, daily life metrics, psychological evaluations, and 'speech records' of PPDD patients.

Prediction models can help identifying individuals at higher fall risk. Electronic health records (EHR) offer an opportunity to develop automated prediction tools that may help to identify fall-prone individuals and lower clinical workload. However, existing models primarily utilise structured EHR data and neglect information in unstructured data. Using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP), we aimed to examine the predictive performance provided by unstructured clinical notes, and their incremental performance over structured data to predict falls. METHODS: We used primary care EHR data of people aged 65 or over. We developed three logistic regression models using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator: one using structured clinical variables (Baseline), one with topics extracted from unstructured clinical notes (Topic-based) and one by adding clinical variables to the extracted topics (Combi). Model performance was assessed in terms of discrimination using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and calibration by calibration plots.

Natural language processing (NLP) tools in extracting biomedical concepts from research articles: a case study on autism spectrum disorder.,Peng J; Zhao M; Havrilla J; Liu C; Weng C; Guthrie W; Schultz R; Wang K; Zhou Y,"BACKGROUND: Natural language processing (NLP) tools can facilitate the extraction of biomedical concepts from unstructured free texts, such as research articles or clinical notes. The NLP software tools CLAMP, cTAKES, and MetaMap are among the most widely used tools to extract biomedical concept entities. However, their performance in extracting disease-specific terminology from literature has not been compared extensively, especially for complex neuropsychiatric disorders with a diverse set of phenotypic and clinical manifestations. METHODS: We comparatively evaluated these NLP tools using autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as a case study. We collected 827 ASD-related terms based on previous literature as the benchmark list for performance evaluation. Then, we applied CLAMP, cTAKES, and MetaMap on 544 full-text articles and 20,408 abstracts from PubMed to extract ASD-related terms. We evaluated the predictive performance using precision, recall, and F1 score. RESULTS: We found that CLAMP has the best performance in terms of F1 score followed by cTAKES and then MetaMap. Our results show that CLAMP has much higher precision than cTAKES and MetaMap, while cTAKES and MetaMap have higher recall than CLAMP.

An Ensemble Deep Learning Model for Drug Abuse Detection in Sparse Twitter-Sphere.,Hu H; Phan N; Geller J; Iezzi S; Vo H; Dou D; Chun SA,"As the problem of drug abuse intensifies in the U.S., many studies that primarily utilize social media data, such as postings on Twitter, to study drug abuse-related activities use machine learning as a powerful tool for text classification and filtering. However, given the wide range of topics of Twitter users, tweets related to drug abuse are rare in most of the datasets. This imbalanced data remains a major issue in building effective tweet classifiers, and is especially obvious for studies that include abuse-related slang terms. In this study, we approach this problem by designing an ensemble deep learning model that leverages both word-level and character-level features to classify abuse-related tweets. Experiments are reported on a Twitter dataset, where we can configure the percentages of the two classes (abuse vs. non abuse) to simulate the data imbalance with different amplitudes. Results show that our ensemble deep learning models exhibit better performance than ensembles of traditional machine learning models, especially on heavily imbalanced datasets.",2019,Aug,Stud Health Technol Inform,264,,163-167,,10.3233/SHTI190204,31437906,#4746,Hu 2019,"",""
Automatic rating of therapist facilitative interpersonal skills in text: A natural language processing application.,Zech JM; Steele R; Foley VK; Hull TD,"BACKGROUND: While message-based therapy has been shown to be effective in treating a range of mood disorders, it is critical to ensure that providers are meeting a consistently high standard of care over this medium. One recently developed measure of messaging quality-The Facilitative Interpersonal Skills Task for Text (FIS-T)-provides estimates of therapists' demonstrated ability to convey psychotherapy's common factors (e.g., hopefulness, warmth, persuasiveness) over text. However, the FIS-T's scoring procedure relies on trained human coders to manually code responses, thereby rendering the FIS-T an unscalable quality control tool for large messaging therapy platforms. OBJECTIVE: In the present study, researchers developed two algorithms to automatically score therapist performance on the FIS-T task. METHODS: The FIS-T was administered to 978 messaging therapists, whose responses were then manually scored by a trained team of raters. Two machine learning algorithms were then trained on task-taker messages and coder scores: a support vector regressor (SVR) and a transformer-based neural network (DistilBERT). RESULTS: The DistilBERT model had superior performance on the prediction task while providing a distribution of ratings that was more closely aligned with those of human raters, versus SVR. Specifically, the DistilBERT model was able to explain 58.8% of the variance (R (2 )= 0.588) in human-derived ratings and realized a prediction mean absolute error of 0.134 on a 1-5 scale. CONCLUSIONS: Algorithms can be effectively used to ensure that digital providers meet a consistently high standard of interactions in the course of messaging therapy.

Can Patients with Dementia Be Identified in Primary Care Electronic Medical Records Using Natural Language Processing?,Maclagan LC; Abdalla M; Harris DA; Stukel TA; Chen B; Candido E; Swartz RH; Iaboni A; Jaakkimainen RL; Bronskill SE,"Dementia and mild cognitive impairment can be underrecognized in primary care practice and research. Free-text fields in electronic medical records (EMRs) are a rich source of information which might support increased detection and enable a better understanding of populations at risk of dementia. We used natural language processing (NLP) to identify dementia-related features in EMRs and compared the performance of supervised machine learning models to classify patients with dementia. We assembled a cohort of primary care patients aged 66 + years in Ontario, Canada, from EMR notes collected until December 2016: 526 with dementia and 44,148 without dementia. We identified dementia-related features by applying published lists, clinician input, and NLP with word embeddings to free-text progress and consult notes and organized features into thematic groups. Using machine learning models, we compared the performance of features to detect dementia, overall and during time periods relative to dementia case ascertainment in health administrative databases. Over 900 dementia-related features were identified and grouped into eight themes (including symptoms, social, function, cognition). Using notes from all time periods, LASSO had the best performance (F1 score: 77.2%, sensitivity: 71.5%, specificity: 99.8%). Model performance was poor when notes written before case ascertainment were included (F1 score: 14.4%, sensitivity: 8.3%, specificity 99.9%) but improved as later notes were added. While similar models may eventually improve recognition of cognitive issues and dementia in primary care EMRs, our findings suggest that further research is needed to identify which additional EMR components might be useful to promote early detection of dementia.

Prediction of Loneliness in Older Adults Using Natural Language Processing: Exploring Sex Differences in Speech.,Badal VD; Graham SA; Depp CA; Shinkawa K; Yamada Y; Palinkas LA; Kim HC; Jeste DV; Lee EE,"OBJECTIVE: The growing pandemic of loneliness has great relevance to aging populations, though assessments are limited by self-report approaches. This paper explores the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technology to evaluate interviews on loneliness, notably, employing natural language processing (NLP) to quantify sentiment and features that indicate loneliness in transcribed speech text of older adults. DESIGN: Participants completed semi-structured qualitative interviews regarding the experience of loneliness and a quantitative self-report scale (University of California Los Angeles or UCLA Loneliness scale) to assess loneliness. Lonely and non-lonely participants (based on qualitative and quantitative assessments) were compared. SETTING: Independent living sector of a senior housing community in San Diego County. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty English-speaking older adults with age range 66-94 (mean 83 years). MEASUREMENTS: Interviews were audiotaped and manually transcribed. Transcripts were examined using NLP approaches to quantify sentiment and expressed emotions. RESULTS: Lonely individuals (by qualitative assessments) had longer responses with greater expression of sadness to direct questions about loneliness. Women were more likely to endorse feeling lonely during the qualitative interview. Men used more fearful and joyful words in their responses. Using linguistic features, machine learning models could predict qualitative loneliness with 94% precision (sensitivity = 0.90, specificity = 1.00) and quantitative loneliness with 76% precision (sensitivity = 0.57, specificity = 0.89).

A Hybrid Feature Extraction Method for Nepali COVID-19-Related Tweets Classification.,Shahi TB; Sitaula C; Paudel N,"COVID-19 is one of the deadliest viruses, which has killed millions of people around the world to this date. The reason for peoples' death is not only linked to its infection but also to peoples' mental states and sentiments triggered by the fear of the virus. People's sentiments, which are predominantly available in the form of posts/tweets on social media, can be interpreted using two kinds of information: syntactical and semantic. Herein, we propose to analyze peoples' sentiment using both kinds of information (syntactical and semantic) on the COVID-19-related twitter dataset available in the Nepali language. For this, we, first, use two widely used text representation methods: TF-IDF and FastText and then combine them to achieve the hybrid features to capture the highly discriminating features. Second, we implement nine widely used machine learning classifiers (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Extreme Tree classifier, AdaBoost, and Multilayer Perceptron), based on the three feature representation methods: TF-IDF, FastText, and Hybrid. To evaluate our methods, we use a publicly available Nepali-COVID-19 tweets dataset, NepCov19Tweets, which consists of Nepali tweets categorized into three classes (Positive, Negative, and Neutral). The evaluation results on the NepCOV19Tweets show that the hybrid feature extraction method not only outperforms the other two individual feature extraction methods while using nine different machine learning algorithms but also provides excellent performance when compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",2022,,Comput Intell Neurosci,2022,,5681574,,10.1155/2022/5681574,35281187,#4790,Shahi 2022,"",""
Automated detection of altered mental status in emergency department clinical notes: a deep learning approach.,Obeid JS; Weeda ER; Matuskowitz AJ; Gagnon K; Crawford T; Carr CM; Frey LJ,"BACKGROUND: Machine learning has been used extensively in clinical text classification tasks. Deep learning approaches using word embeddings have been recently gaining momentum in biomedical applications. In an effort to automate the identification of altered mental status (AMS) in emergency department provider notes for the purpose of decision support, we compare the performance of classic bag-of-words-based machine learning classifiers and novel deep learning approaches. METHODS: We used a case-control study design to extract an adequate number of clinical notes with AMS and non-AMS based on ICD codes. The notes were parsed to extract the history of present illness, which was used as the clinical text for the classifiers. The notes were manually labeled by clinicians. As a baseline for comparison, we tested several traditional bag-of-words based classifiers. We then tested several deep learning models using a convolutional neural network architecture with three different types of word embeddings, a pre-trained word2vec model and two models without pre-training but with different word embedding dimensions. RESULTS: We evaluated the models on 1130 labeled notes from the emergency department. The deep learning models had the best overall performance with an area under the ROC curve of 98.5% and an accuracy of 94.5%. Pre-training word embeddings on the unlabeled corpus reduced training iterations and had performance that was statistically no different than the other deep learning models. CONCLUSION: This supervised deep learning approach performs exceedingly well for the detection of AMS symptoms in clinical text in our environment. Further work is needed for the generalizability of these findings, including evaluation of these models in other types of clinical notes and other environments.

Detection of Depression and Suicide Risk Based on Text From Clinical Interviews Using Machine Learning: Possibility of a New Objective Diagnostic Marker.,Shin D; Kim K; Lee SB; Lee C; Bae YS; Cho WI; Kim MJ; Hyung Keun Park C; Chie EK; Kim NS; Ahn YM,"BACKGROUND: Depression and suicide are critical social problems worldwide, but tools to objectively diagnose them are lacking. Therefore, this study aimed to diagnose depression through machine learning and determine whether it is possible to identify groups at high risk of suicide through words spoken by the participants in a semi-structured interview. METHODS: A total of 83 healthy and 83 depressed patients were recruited. All participants were recorded during the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Through the suicide risk assessment from the interview items, participants with depression were classified into high-suicide-risk (31 participants) and low-suicide-risk (52 participants) groups. The recording was transcribed into text after only the words uttered by the participant were extracted. In addition, all participants were evaluated for depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, and impulsivity. The chi-square test and student's T-test were used to compare clinical variables, and the Naive Bayes classifier was used for the machine learning text model. RESULTS: A total of 21,376 words were extracted from all participants and the model for diagnosing patients with depression based on this text confirmed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.905, a sensitivity of 0.699, and a specificity of 0.964. In the model that distinguished the two groups using statistically significant demographic variables, the AUC was only 0.761. The DeLong test result (p-value 0.001) confirmed that the text-based classification was superior to the demographic model. When predicting the high-suicide-risk group, the demographics-based AUC was 0.499, while the text-based one was 0.632. However, the AUC of the ensemble model incorporating demographic variables was 0.800. CONCLUSION: The possibility of diagnosing depression using interview text was confirmed; regarding suicide risk, the diagnosis accuracy increased when demographic variables were incorporated.

Deep Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data Using a Hybrid Ghost Convolution Neural Network Model.,Ali Al-Abyadh MH; Iesa MAM; Hafeez Abdel Azeem HA; Singh DP; Kumar P; Abdulamir M; Jalali A,"Several problems remain, despite the evident advantages of sentiment analysis of public opinion represented on Twitter and Facebook. On complicated training data, hybrid approaches may reduce sentiment mistakes. This research assesses the dependability of numerous hybrid approaches on a variety of datasets. Across domains and datasets, we compare hybrid models to singles. Text tweets and reviews are included in our deep sentiment analysis learning systems. The support vector machine (SVM), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and ghost model convolution neural network (CNN) are combined to get the hybrid model. The dependability and computation time of each approach were evaluated. On all datasets, hybrid models outperform single models when deep learning and SVM are combined. The traditional models were less trustworthy, and deep learning algorithms have recently shown their enormous promise in sentiment analysis. Linear transformations are used in feature maps to eliminate duplicate or related features. The ghost unit makes ghost features by taking away attributes that are both similar and duplicated from each intrinsic feature. LSTM produces higher results but takes longer to process, while CNN needs less hyperparameter adjusting and monitoring. The effectiveness of the integrated model varies depending on the work, and all performed better than the others. For hybrid deep sentiment analysis learning models, LSTM networks, CNNs, and SVMs are needed. Hybrid models are used to compare SVM, LSTM, and CNN, and we tested each method's accuracy and errors. Deep learning-SVM hybrid models improve sentiment analysis accuracy.

Cognitive decline assessment using semantic linguistic content and transformer deep learning architecture.,Pl R; Ks G,"BACKGROUND: Dementia is a cognitive decline that leads to the progressive deterioration of an individual's ability to perform daily activities independently. As a result, a considerable amount of time and resources are spent on caretaking. Early detection of dementia can significantly reduce the effort and resources needed for caretaking. AIMS: This research proposes an approach for assessing cognitive decline by analysing speech data, specifically focusing on speech relevance as a crucial indicator for memory recall. METHODS & PROCEDURES: This is a cross-sectional, online, self-administered. The proposed method used deep learning architecture based on transformers, with BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and Sentence-Transformer to derive encoded representations of speech transcripts. These representations provide contextually descriptive information that is used to analyse the relevance of sentences in their respective contexts. The encoded information is then compared using cosine similarity metrics to measure the relevance of uttered sequences of sentences. The study uses the Pitt Corpus Dementia dataset for experimentation, which consists of speech data from individuals with and without dementia. The accuracy of the proposed multi-QA-MPNet (Multi-Query Maximum Inner Product Search Pretraining) model is compared with other pretrained transformer models of Sentence-Transformer. OUTCOMES & RESULTS: The results show that the proposed approach outperforms the other models in capturing context level information, particularly semantic memory. Additionally, the study explores the suitability of different similarity measures to evaluate the relevance of uttered sequences of sentences. The experimentation reveals that cosine similarity is the most appropriate measure for this task. CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS: This finding has significant implications for the early warning signs of dementia, as it suggests that cosine similarity metrics can effectively capture the semantic relevance of spoken language. The persistent cognitive decline over time acts as one of the indicators for prevalence of dementia. Additionally early dementia could be recognised by analysis on other modalities like speech and brain images. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: What is already known on this subject It is already known that speech- and language-based detection methods can be useful for dementia diagnosis, as language difficulties are often early signs of the disease. Additionally, deep learning algorithms have shown promise in detecting and diagnosing dementia through analysing large datasets, particularly in speech- and language-based detection methods. However, further research is needed to validate the performance of these algorithms on larger and more diverse datasets and to address potential biases and limitations. What this paper adds to existing knowledge This study presents a unique and effective approach for cognitive decline assessment through analysing speech data. The study provides valuable insights into the importance of context and semantic memory in accurately detecting the potential in dementia and demonstrates the applicability of deep learning models for this purpose. The findings of this study have important clinical implications and can inform future research and development in the field of dementia detection and care. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work?

METHODS: First free-text physician notes and demographic information were collected for children under 5 years of age at a Level 1 Trauma Center. The control group, which included patients with head/neck injury, was compared to those with AHT diagnosed by the Child Protective Team. Differential scores accounted for words overrepresented in AHT patient vs. control notes. Sentiment scores were reflective of note positivity/negativity and subjectivity scores accounted for note subjectivity/objectivity. The composite scores reflected the patient's differential score modified by the subjectivity score. Composite, sentiment, and subjectivity scores combined with demographic information trained a Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm to predict AHT. RESULTS: Final composite scores with demographic information were highly associated with AHT in a test dataset. The control group included 587 patients and the test group included 193 patients. Combining composite scores with demographic information into the RF model improved AHT classification area under the curve (AUC) from 0.68 to 0.78, with an overall accuracy of 84%. Feature importance analysis of our RF model revealed that composite score, sentiment, age, and subjectivity were the most impactful predictors of AHT. The sentiment was not significantly different between control and AHT notes (p = 0.87), while subjectivity trended higher for AHT notes (p = 0.081).

From the clinical notes, we generated datasets of single keywords and multi-word phrases, and constructed prediction models using a machine-learning algorithm based on a genetic programming framework. The resulting inference accuracy was consistently 65% or more.

Automatically identifying social isolation from clinical narratives for patients with prostate Cancer.,Zhu VJ; Lenert LA; Bunnell BE; Obeid JS; Jefferson M; Halbert CH,"BACKGROUND: Social isolation is an important social determinant that impacts health outcomes and mortality among patients. The National Academy of Medicine recently recommended that social isolation be documented in electronic health records (EHR). However, social isolation usually is not recorded or obtained as coded data but rather collected from patient self-report or documented in clinical narratives. This study explores the feasibility and effectiveness of natural language processing (NLP) strategy for identifying patients who are socially isolated from clinical narratives. METHOD: We used data from the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) Research Data Warehouse. Patients 18 years-of-age or older who were diagnosed with prostate cancer between January 1, 2014 and May 31, 2017 were eligible for this study. NLP pipelines identifying social isolation were developed via extraction of notes on progress, history and physical, consult, emergency department provider, telephone encounter, discharge summary, plan of care, and radiation oncology. Of 4195 eligible prostate cancer patients, we randomly sampled 3138 patients (75%) as a training dataset. The remaining 1057 patients (25%) were used as a test dataset to evaluate NLP algorithm performance. Standard performance measures for the NLP algorithm, including precision, recall, and F-measure, were assessed by expert manual review using the test dataset. RESULTS: A total of 55,516 clinical notes from 3138 patients were included to develop the lexicon and NLP pipelines for social isolation. Of those, 35 unique patients (1.2%) had social isolation mention(s) in 217 notes. Among 24 terms relevant to social isolation, the most prevalent were ""lack of social support,"" ""lonely,"" ""social isolation,"" ""no friends,"" and ""loneliness"".

Identifying features of risk periods for suicide attempts using document frequency and language use in electronic health records.,Dutta R; Gkotsis G; Velupillai SU; Downs J; Roberts A; Stewart R; Hotopf M,"BACKGROUND: Individualising mental healthcare at times when a patient is most at risk of suicide involves shifting research emphasis from static risk factors to those that may be modifiable with interventions. Currently, risk assessment is based on a range of extensively reported stable risk factors, but critical to dynamic suicide risk assessment is an understanding of each individual patient's health trajectory over time. The use of electronic health records (EHRs) and analysis using machine learning has the potential to accelerate progress in developing early warning indicators. SETTING: EHR data from the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLaM) which provides secondary mental healthcare for 1.8 million people living in four South London boroughs. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the time window proximal to a hospitalised suicide attempt can be discriminated from a distal period of lower risk by analysing the documentation and mental health clinical free text data from EHRs and (i) investigate whether the rate at which EHR documents are recorded per patient is associated with a suicide attempt; (ii) compare document-level word usage between documents proximal and distal to a suicide attempt; and (iii) compare n-gram frequency related to third-person pronoun use proximal and distal to a suicide attempt using machine learning. METHODS: The Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) system allowed access to de-identified information from the EHRs. CRIS has been linked with Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data for Admitted Patient Care. We analysed document and event data for patients who had at some point between 1 April 2006 and 31 March 2013 been hospitalised with a HES ICD-10 code related to attempted suicide (X60-X84; Y10-Y34; Y87.0/Y87.2). FINDINGS: n = 8,247 patients were identified to have made a hospitalised suicide attempt. Of these, n = 3,167 (39.8%) of patients had at least one document available in their EHR prior to their first suicide attempt. N = 1,424 (45.0%) of these patients had been ""monitored"" by mental healthcare services in the past 30 days. From 60 days prior to a first suicide attempt, there was a rapid increase in the monitoring level (document recording of the past 30 days) increasing from 35.1 to 45.0%. Documents containing words related to prescribed medications/drugs/overdose/poisoning/addiction had the highest odds of being a risk indicator used proximal to a suicide attempt (OR 1.88; precision 0.91 and recall 0.93), and documents with words citing a care plan were associated with the lowest risk for a suicide attempt (OR 0.22; precision 1.00 and recall 1.00).

CONCLUSION: EHR documentation frequency and language use can be used to distinguish periods distal from and proximal to a suicide attempt.

Challenges and solutions to employing natural language processing and machine learning to measure patients' health literacy and physician writing complexity: The ECLIPPSE study.,Brown W 3rd; Balyan R; Karter AJ; Crossley S; Semere W; Duran ND; Lyles C; Liu J; Moffet HH; Daniels R; McNamara DS; Schillinger D,"OBJECTIVE: In the National Library of Medicine funded ECLIPPSE Project (Employing Computational Linguistics to Improve Patient-Provider Secure Emails exchange), we attempted to create novel, valid, and scalable measures of both patients' health literacy (HL) and physicians' linguistic complexity by employing natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning (ML). We applied these techniques to > 400,000 patients' and physicians' secure messages (SMs) exchanged via an electronic patient portal, developing and validating an automated patient literacy profile (LP) and physician complexity profile (CP). Herein, we describe the challenges faced and the solutions implemented during this innovative endeavor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To describe challenges and solutions, we used two data sources: study documents and interviews with study investigators. Over the five years of the project, the team tracked their research process using a combination of Google Docs tools and an online team organization, tracking, and management tool (Asana). In year 5, the team convened a number of times to discuss, categorize, and code primary challenges and solutions. RESULTS: We identified 23 challenges and associated approaches that emerged from three overarching process domains: (1) Data Mining related to the SM corpus; (2) Analyses using NLP indices on the SM corpus; and (3) Interdisciplinary Collaboration. With respect to Data Mining, problems included cleaning SMs to enable analyses, removing hidden caregiver proxies (e.g., other family members) and Spanish language SMs, and culling SMs to ensure that only patients' primary care physicians were included. With respect to Analyses, critical decisions needed to be made as to which computational linguistic indices and ML approaches should be selected; how to enable the NLP-based linguistic indices tools to run smoothly and to extract meaningful data from a large corpus of medical text; and how to best assess content and predictive validities of both the LP and the CP. With respect to the Interdisciplinary Collaboration, because the research required engagement between clinicians, health services researchers, biomedical informaticians, linguists, and cognitive scientists, continual effort was needed to identify and reconcile differences in scientific terminologies and resolve confusion; arrive at common understanding of tasks that needed to be completed and priorities therein; reach compromises regarding what represents ""meaningful findings"" in health services vs. cognitive science research; and address constraints regarding potential transportability of the final LP and CP to different health care settings. DISCUSSION: Our study represents a process evaluation of an innovative research initiative to harness ""big linguistic data"" to estimate patient HL and physician linguistic complexity. Any of the challenges we identified, if left unaddressed, would have either rendered impossible the effort to generate LPs and CPs, or invalidated analytic results related to the LPs and CPs. Investigators undertaking similar research in HL or using computational linguistic methods to assess patient-clinician exchange will face similar challenges and may find our solutions helpful when designing and executing their health communications research.",2021,Jan,J Biomed Inform,113,,103658,,10.1016/j.jbi.2020.103658,33316421,#4858,BrownW3rd 2021,"",""

Using Wearable Devices and Speech Data for Personalized Machine Learning in Early Detection of Mental Disorders: Protocol for a Participatory Research Study.,Diaz-Ramos RE; Noriega I; Trejo LA; Stroulia E; Cao B,"BACKGROUND: Early identification of mental disorder symptoms is crucial for timely treatment and reduction of recurring symptoms and disabilities. A tool to help individuals recognize warning signs is important. We posit that such a tool would have to rely on longitudinal analysis of patterns and trends in the individual's daily activities and mood, which can now be captured through data from wearable activity trackers, speech recordings from mobile devices, and the individual's own description of their mental state. In this paper, we describe such a tool developed by our team to detect early signs of depression, anxiety, and stress. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine three questions about the effectiveness of machine learning models constructed based on multimodal data from wearables, speech, and self-reports: (1) How does speech about issues of personal context differ from speech while reading a neutral text, what type of speech data are more helpful in detecting mental health indicators, and how is the quality of the machine learning models influenced by multilanguage data? (2) Does accuracy improve with longitudinal data collection and how, and what are the most important features? and (3) How do personalized machine learning models compare against population-level models? METHODS: We collect longitudinal data to aid machine learning in accurately identifying patterns of mental disorder symptoms. We developed an app that collects voice, physiological, and activity data. Physiological and activity data are provided by a variety of off-the-shelf fitness trackers, that record steps, active minutes, duration of sleeping stages (rapid eye movement, deep, and light sleep), calories consumed, distance walked, heart rate, and speed. We also collect voice recordings of users reading specific texts and answering open-ended questions chosen randomly from a set of questions without repetition. Finally, the app collects users' answers to the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale. The collected data from wearable devices and voice recordings will be used to train machine learning models to predict the levels of anxiety, stress, and depression in participants. RESULTS: The study is ongoing, and data collection will be completed by November 2023. We expect to recruit at least 50 participants attending 2 major universities (in Canada and Mexico) fluent in English or Spanish. The study will include participants aged between 18 and 35 years, with no communication disorders, acute neurological diseases, or history of brain damage. Data collection complied with ethical and privacy requirements. CONCLUSIONS: The study aims to advance personalized machine learning for mental health; generate a data set to predict Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale results; and deploy a framework for early detection of depression, anxiety, and stress. Our long-term goal is to develop a noninvasive and objective method for collecting mental health data and promptly detecting mental disorder symptoms.

Suicide risk detection using artificial intelligence: the promise of creating a benchmark dataset for research on the detection of suicide risk.,Parsapoor Mah Parsa M; Koudys JW; Ruocco AC,"Suicide is a leading cause of death that demands cross-disciplinary research efforts to develop and deploy suicide risk screening tools. Such tools, partly informed by influential suicide theories, can help identify individuals at the greatest risk of suicide and should be able to predict the transition from suicidal thoughts to suicide attempts. Advances in artificial intelligence have revolutionized the development of suicide screening tools and suicide risk detection systems. Thus, various types of AI systems, including text-based systems, have been proposed to identify individuals at risk of suicide. Although these systems have shown acceptable performance, most of them have not incorporated suicide theories in their design. Furthermore, directly applying suicide theories may be difficult because of the diversity and complexity of these theories. To address these challenges, we propose an approach to develop speech- and language-based suicide risk detection systems. We highlight the promise of establishing a benchmark textual and vocal dataset using a standardized speech and language assessment procedure, and research designs that distinguish between the risk factors for suicide attempt above and beyond those for suicidal ideation alone. The benchmark dataset could be used to develop trustworthy machine learning or deep learning-based suicide risk detection systems, ultimately constructing a foundation for vocal and textual-based suicide risk detection systems.",2023,,Front Psychiatry,14,,1186569,,10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1186569,37564247,#4908,ParsapoorMahParsa 2023,"",""
Classification of Helpful Comments on Online Suicide Watch Forums.,Kavuluru R; Williams AG; Ramos-Morales M; Haye L; Holaday T; Cerel J,"Among social media websites, Reddit has emerged as a widely used online message board for focused mental health topics including depression, addiction, and suicide watch (SW). In particular, the SW community/subreddit has nearly 40,000 subscribers and 13 human moderators who monitor for abusive comments among other things. Given comments on posts from users expressing suicidal thoughts can be written from any part of the world at any time, moderating in a timely manner can be tedious. Furthermore, Reddit's default comment ranking does not involve aspects that relate to the ""helpfulness"" of a comment from a suicide prevention (SP) perspective. Being able to automatically identify and score helpful comments from such a perspective can assist moderators, help SW posters to have immediate feedback on the SP relevance of a comment, and also provide insights to SP researchers for dealing with online aspects of SP. In this paper, we report what we believe is the first effort in automatic identification of helpful comments on online posts in SW forums with the SW subreddit as the use-case. We use a dataset of 3000 real SW comments and obtain SP researcher judgments regarding their helpfulness in the contexts of the corresponding original posts. We conduct supervised learning experiments with content based features including n-grams, word psychometric scores, and discourse relation graphs and report encouraging F-scores (≈ 80 - 90%) for the helpful comment classes. Our results indicate that machine learning approaches can offer complementary moderating functionality for SW posts.

Diagnostic codes related to suicidal behavior were applied to the datamart to screen women for suicidal behavior. Among women without any diagnostic codes related to suicidal behavior (n = 273,410), 5880 women were randomly sampled, of whom 1120 had at least one mention of terms related to suicidal behavior in clinical notes. NLP was then used to process clinical notes for the 1120 women. Chart reviews were performed for subsamples of women. RESULTS: Using diagnostic codes, 196 pregnant women were screened positive for suicidal behavior, among whom 149 (76%) had confirmed suicidal behavior by chart review. Using NLP among those without diagnostic codes, 486 pregnant women were screened positive for suicidal behavior, among whom 146 (30%) had confirmed suicidal behavior by chart review. CONCLUSIONS: The use of NLP substantially improves the sensitivity of screening suicidal behavior in EMRs.

Validating a strategy for psychosocial phenotyping using a large corpus of clinical text.,Gundlapalli AV; Redd A; Carter M; Divita G; Shen S; Palmer M; Samore MH,"OBJECTIVE: To develop algorithms to improve efficiency of patient phenotyping using natural language processing (NLP) on text data. Of a large number of note titles available in our database, we sought to determine those with highest yield and precision for psychosocial concepts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From a database of over 1 billion documents from US Department of Veterans Affairs medical facilities, a random sample of 1500 documents from each of 218 enterprise note titles were chosen. Psychosocial concepts were extracted using a UIMA-AS-based NLP pipeline (v3NLP), using a lexicon of relevant concepts with negation and template format annotators. Human reviewers evaluated a subset of documents for false positives and sensitivity. High-yield documents were identified by hit rate and precision. Reasons for false positivity were characterized. RESULTS: A total of 58 707 psychosocial concepts were identified from 316 355 documents for an overall hit rate of 0.2 concepts per document (median 0.1, range 1.6-0). Of 6031 concepts reviewed from a high-yield set of note titles, the overall precision for all concept categories was 80%, with variability among note titles and concept categories. Reasons for false positivity included templating, negation, context, and alternate meaning of words. The sensitivity of the NLP system was noted to be 49% (95% CI 43% to 55%).

Incorporating Domain Knowledge Into Language Models by Using Graph Convolutional Networks for Assessing Semantic Textual Similarity: Model Development and Performance Comparison.,Chang D; Lin E; Brandt C; Taylor RA,"BACKGROUND: Although electronic health record systems have facilitated clinical documentation in health care, they have also introduced new challenges, such as the proliferation of redundant information through the use of copy and paste commands or templates. One approach to trimming down bloated clinical documentation and improving clinical summarization is to identify highly similar text snippets with the goal of removing such text. OBJECTIVE: We developed a natural language processing system for the task of assessing clinical semantic textual similarity. The system assigns scores to pairs of clinical text snippets based on their clinical semantic similarity. METHODS: We leveraged recent advances in natural language processing and graph representation learning to create a model that combines linguistic and domain knowledge information from the MedSTS data set to assess clinical semantic textual similarity. We used bidirectional encoder representation from transformers (BERT)-based models as text encoders for the sentence pairs in the data set and graph convolutional networks (GCNs) as graph encoders for corresponding concept graphs that were constructed based on the sentences. We also explored techniques, including data augmentation, ensembling, and knowledge distillation, to improve the model's performance, as measured by the Pearson correlation coefficient (r). RESULTS: Fine-tuning the BERT_base and ClinicalBERT models on the MedSTS data set provided a strong baseline (Pearson correlation coefficients: 0.842 and 0.848, respectively) compared to those of the previous year's submissions. Our data augmentation techniques yielded moderate gains in performance, and adding a GCN-based graph encoder to incorporate the concept graphs also boosted performance, especially when the node features were initialized with pretrained knowledge graph embeddings of the concepts (r=0.868). As expected, ensembling improved performance, and performing multisource ensembling by using different language model variants, conducting knowledge distillation with the multisource ensemble model, and taking a final ensemble of the distilled models further improved the system's performance (Pearson correlation coefficients: 0.875, 0.878, and 0.882, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a system for the MedSTS clinical semantic textual similarity benchmark task, which was created by combining BERT-based text encoders and GCN-based graph encoders in order to incorporate domain knowledge into the natural language processing pipeline. We also experimented with other techniques involving data augmentation, pretrained concept embeddings, ensembling, and knowledge distillation to further increase our system's performance.

Automatically Identifying Financial Stress Information from Clinical Notes for Patients with Prostate Cancer.,Zhu V; Lenert L; Bunnell B; Obeid J; Jefferson M; Halbert CH,"BACKGROUND: Financial stress, one of the social determinants, is common among cancer patients because of high out-ofpocket costs for treatment, as well as indirect costs. The National Academy of Medicine (NAM) has advised providers to recognize and discuss cost concerns with patients in order to enhance shared decision-making for treatment and exploration of financial assistant programs. However, financial stress is rarely assessed in clinical practice or research, thus, under-coded and under-documented in clinical practice. Natural language processing (NLP) offers great potential that can automatically extract and process data on financial stress from clinical free text existing in the patient electronic health record (EHR). METHODS: We developed and evaluated an NLP approach to identify financial stress from clinical narratives for patients with prostate cancer. Of 4,195 eligible prostate cancer patients, we randomly sampled 3,138 patients (75%) as a training dataset (150,990 documents) to develop a financial stress lexicon and NLP algorithms iteratively. The remaining 1,057 patients (25%) were used as a test dataset (55,516 documents) to evaluate the NLP algorithm performance. The common terms representing financial stress were ""financial concerns,"" ""unable to afford,"" ""insurance issue,"" ""unemployed,"" and ""financial assistance."" Negations were used to exclude false mentions of financial stress. RESULTS: Applying both pre- and post-negation, the NLP algorithm identified 209 patients (6.0%) from the training sample and 66 patients (6.2%) with 161 notes from the test sample as having documented financial stress. Two independent domain experts manually reviewed all 161 notes with NLP identified positives and randomly selected 161 notes with NLP-identified negatives, the NLP algorithm yielded 0.86 for precision, 1 for recall, and 0.9.2 for F-score.

As an adjunct to such internet-based CBT (ICBT) approaches, text messaging has been associated with increased adherence and therapeutic alliance. OBJECTIVE: This study analyzed data from the intervention arm of a randomized control trial evaluating 24-week ICBT for MDD (intervention arm) against standard-care psychiatry (waitlist control). The aim of this secondary analysis was to assess MDD symptom improvement in relation to the frequency and content of text messages sent by ICBT participants to Navigator-Coaches during randomized control trial participation. Higher text frequency in general and in 3 conceptual categories (appreciating alliance, alliance building disclosures, and agreement confirmation) was hypothesized to predict larger MDD symptom improvement. METHODS: Participants were young adults (18-30 years) from the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. The frequencies of categorized texts from 20 ICBT completers were analyzed with respect to MDD symptom improvement using linear regression models. Texts were coded by 2 independent coders and categorized using content analysis. MDD symptoms were measured using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). RESULTS: Participants sent an average of 136 text messages. Analyses indicated that BDI-II improvement was negatively associated with text messaging frequency in general (β=-0.029, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.048) and in each of the 3 categories: appreciating alliance (β=-0.096, 95% CI -0.80 to 0.61), alliance building disclosures (β=-0.098, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.084), and agreement confirmation (β=-0.076, 95% CI -0.40 to 0.25). Altogether, the effect of text messaging on BDI-II improvement was uniformly negative across statistical models. More text messaging appeared associated with less MDD symptom improvement. CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesized positive associations between conceptually categorized text messages and MDD symptom improvement were not supported in this study. Instead, more text messaging appeared to indicate less treatment benefit. Future studies with larger samples are needed to discern the optimal use of text messaging in ICBT approaches using adjunctive modes of communication.

Assessment of supervised classifiers for the task of detecting messages with suicidal ideation.,Acuña Caicedo RW; Gómez Soriano JM; Melgar Sasieta HA,"According to the World Health Organization (WHO) close to 800,000 people worldwide die by suicide each year, and many more attempts to do it. In consequence, the WHO recognizes suicide as a global public health priority, which affects not only rich countries but poor and middle-income countries as well. This study makes a systematic analysis of 28 supervised classifiers using different features of the corpus Life to detect messages with suicidal ideation and depression to know if these can be used in an automatic prevention online system. The Life Corpus, used in this research, is a bilingual text corpus (English and Spanish) oriented to the detection of suicide ideation. This corpus was constructed retrieving texts from several social networks and its quality was measured using mutual annotation agreement. The different experiments determined that the classifier with the best performance was KStar, with the corpus features POS-SYNSETS-NUM, achieving the best results with the ROC Area metrics of 0,81036 and F-measure of 0,7148. The present research fulfilled the objective of discovering which supervised classifiers and which features are the most suitable for the automatic classification of messages with suicidal ideation using the Life Corpus. Also, given the imbalance of the results, a new precision measure was developed called the Two-dimensional Accuracy and Recovery Index (GDP), which can provide better results, in unbalanced systems, than the usual measures to assess the quality of the results (measure F, Area ROC), and thus increase the number of messages at risk of suicidal ideation, detected at the cost of receiving more messages that are not related to suicide or vice versa.",2020,Aug,Heliyon,6,8,e04412,,10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e04412,32775739,#5034,AcuñaCaicedo 2020,"",""
Validation of a Natural Language Processing Algorithm for the Extraction of the Sleep Parameters from the Polysomnography Reports.,Rahman M; Nowakowski S; Agrawal R; Naik A; Sharafkhaneh A; Razjouyan J,"Background: There is a need to better understand the association between sleep and chronic diseases. In this study we developed a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to mine polysomnography (PSG) free-text notes from electronic medical records (EMR) and evaluated the performance. Methods: Using the Veterans Health Administration EMR, we identified 46,093 PSG studies using CPT code 95,810 from 1 October 2000−30 September 2019. We randomly selected 200 notes to compare the accuracy of the NLP algorithm in mining sleep parameters including total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE) and sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), and apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) compared to visual inspection by raters masked to the NLP output. Results: The NLP performance on the training phase was >0.90 for precision, recall, and F-1 score for TST, SOL, SE, WASO, and AHI. The NLP performance on the test phase was >0.90 for precision, recall, and F-1 score for TST, SOL, SE, WASO, and AHI.

A Deep Learning-Based TE Method for MSs' Mental Health Analysis.,Tao R,"Teaching evaluation (TE) is of great significance in education and can judge the value and appropriateness of the curriculum, which is a distinguished part of the educational work. Compared with other courses focusing on imparting knowledge, mental health not only imparts psychological knowledge but also cultivates Marxism students' (MSs) ability to adjust psychology and maintain mental health. Therefore, the evaluation of this course has a special character. As the unity of scientific world outlook and values, Marxism can promote students' mental health. When assessing students' ability to maintain mental health, the influence of Marxism should be taken into account. In this study, we first established an evaluation index system in line with the actual mental health considering the influence of Marxism and put forward a deep memory network with prior information (PI-DMN) to realize the aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) of the student evaluation text. Combined with students' scoring of the course, the sentiment analysis results are used as the input dataset of LSTM model to realize the TE of mental health course.

A Novel Adaptive Affective Cognition Analysis Model for College Students Using a Deep Convolution Neural Network and Deep Features.,Feng H,"Currently, under the impact of the COVID-19, college students are facing increasingly elevated employment pressure and higher education pressure. This can easily cause a huge psychological burden on them, causing affective cognition problems such as anxiety and depression. In the long run, this is not conducive to students' physical and mental health, nor is it conducive to the healthy development of the school and even the whole society. Therefore, it is imperative to build a novel adaptive affective cognition analysis model for college students. In particular, in the context of smart cities and smart China, many universities have opened the smart campus mode, which provides a huge data resource for our research. Due to problems of the low real-time evaluation and single data source in traditional questionnaire evaluation methods, evaluation errors are prone to occur, which in turn interferes with subsequent treatment. Therefore, for the purpose of alleviating the above deficiencies and improving the efficiency and accuracy of the affective cognition analysis model of college students, this paper studies the adaptive affective cognition analysis method of college students on basis of deep learning. First, because students' psychological problems are often not sudden, on the contrary, most of these abnormalities will leave traces in their daily activities. Therefore, this paper constructs a multisource dataset with the access control data, network data, and learning data collected from the smart campus platform to describe the affective cognition status of students. Second, the multisource dataset is divided into two categories: image and text, and the CNN model is introduced to mine the psychological characteristics of college students, so as to provide a reference for the subsequent affective cognition state assessment. Finally, simulation tests are developed to confirm the viability of the technique suggested in this research. The experiments demonstrate that the accuracy of the assessment model is significantly increased because it can fully reflect the heterogeneity and comprehensiveness of the data. This also highlights that the new method has a wide range of potential applications in the modern campus setting and is also helpful in fostering the accuracy and depth of college students' work on their affective cognition.",2022,,Comput Intell Neurosci,2022,,2114114,,10.1155/2022/2114114,36065365,#5055,Feng 2022,"",""
Conversational Chatbot for Cigarette Smoking Cessation: Results From the 11-Step User-Centered Design Development Process and Randomized Controlled Trial.,Bricker JB; Sullivan B; Mull K; Santiago-Torres M; Lavista Ferres JM,"BACKGROUND: Conversational chatbots are an emerging digital intervention for smoking cessation. No studies have reported on the entire development process of a cessation chatbot. OBJECTIVE: We aim to report results of the user-centered design development process and randomized controlled trial for a novel and comprehensive quit smoking conversational chatbot called QuitBot. METHODS: The 4 years of formative research for developing QuitBot followed an 11-step process: (1) specifying a conceptual model; (2) conducting content analysis of existing interventions (63 hours of intervention transcripts); (3) assessing user needs; (4) developing the chat's persona (""personality""); (5) prototyping content and persona; (6) developing full functionality; (7) programming the QuitBot; (8) conducting a diary study; (9) conducting a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT); (10) reviewing results of the RCT; and (11) adding a free-form question and answer (QnA) function, based on user feedback from pilot RCT results. The process of adding a QnA function itself involved a three-step process: (1) generating QnA pairs, (2) fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on QnA pairs, and (3) evaluating the LLM outputs. RESULTS: We developed a quit smoking program spanning 42 days of 2- to 3-minute conversations covering topics ranging from motivations to quit, setting a quit date, choosing Food and Drug Administration-approved cessation medications, coping with triggers, and recovering from lapses and relapses. In a pilot RCT with 96% three-month outcome data retention, QuitBot demonstrated high user engagement and promising cessation rates compared to the National Cancer Institute's SmokefreeTXT text messaging program, particularly among those who viewed all 42 days of program content: 30-day, complete-case, point prevalence abstinence rates at 3-month follow-up were 63% (39/62) for QuitBot versus 38.5% (45/117) for SmokefreeTXT (odds ratio 2.58, 95% CI 1.34-4.99; P=.005). However, Facebook Messenger intermittently blocked participants' access to QuitBot, so we transitioned from Facebook Messenger to a stand-alone smartphone app as the communication channel. Participants' frustration with QuitBot's inability to answer their open-ended questions led to us develop a core conversational feature, enabling users to ask open-ended questions about quitting cigarette smoking and for the QuitBot to respond with accurate and professional answers. To support this functionality, we developed a library of 11,000 QnA pairs on topics associated with quitting cigarette smoking. Model testing results showed that Microsoft's Azure-based QnA maker effectively handled questions that matched our library of 11,000 QnA pairs. A fine-tuned, contextualized GPT-3.5 (OpenAI) responds to questions that are not within our library of QnA pairs. CONCLUSIONS: The development process yielded the first LLM-based quit smoking program delivered as a conversational chatbot. Iterative testing led to significant enhancements, including improvements to the delivery channel. A pivotal addition was the inclusion of a core LLM-supported conversational feature allowing users to ask open-ended questions.

Automatic emotion recognition in healthcare data using supervised machine learning.,Azam N; Ahmad T; Ul Haq N,"Human feelings are fundamental to perceive the conduct and state of mind of an individual. A healthy emotional state is one significant highlight to improve personal satisfaction. On the other hand, bad emotional health can prompt social or psychological well-being issues. Recognizing or detecting feelings in online health care data gives important and helpful information regarding the emotional state of patients. To recognize or detection of patient's emotion against a specific disease using text from online sources is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a method for the automatic detection of patient's emotions in healthcare data using supervised machine learning approaches. For this purpose, we created a new dataset named EmoHD, comprising of 4,202 text samples against eight disease classes and six emotion classes, gathered from different online resources. We used six different supervised machine learning models based on different feature engineering techniques. We also performed a detailed comparison of the chosen six machine learning algorithms using different feature vectors on our dataset. We achieved the highest 87% accuracy using MultiLayer Perceptron as compared to other state of the art models. Moreover, we use the emotional guidance scale to show that there is a link between negative emotion and psychological health issues.

This study sought to develop and validate a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to identify information related to being INEADS from clinical notes. We used a publicly available dataset of critical care patients from 2001 through 2012 at a United States academic medical center, which contained 418,393 relevant clinical notes for 23,904 adult admissions. We developed 17 subcategories indicating reduced or elevated potential for being INEADS, and created a vocabulary of terms and expressions within each. We used an NLP application to create a language model and expand these vocabularies. The NLP algorithm was validated against gold standard manual review of 300 notes and showed good performance overall (F-score = 0.83). More than 80% of admissions had notes containing information in at least one subcategory. Thirty percent (n = 7,134) contained at least one of five social subcategories indicating elevated potential for being INEADS, and <1% (n = 81) contained at least four, which we classified as high likelihood of being INEADS. Among these, n = 8 admissions had no subcategory indicating reduced likelihood of being INEADS, and appeared to meet the definition of INEADS following manual review. Among the remaining n = 73 who had at least one subcategory indicating reduced likelihood of being INEADS, manual review of a 10% sample showed that most did not appear to be INEADS. Compared with the full cohort, the high likelihood group was significantly more likely to die during hospitalization and within four years, to have Medicaid, to have an emergency admission, and to be male.

Validating Automated Sentiment Analysis of Online Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Patient Texts: An Exploratory Study.,Provoost S; Ruwaard J; van Breda W; Riper H; Bosse T,"INTRODUCTION: Sentiment analysis may be a useful technique to derive a user's emotional state from free text input, allowing for more empathic automated feedback in online cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) interventions for psychological disorders such as depression. As guided iCBT is considered more effective than unguided iCBT, such automated feedback may help close the gap between the two. The accuracy of automated sentiment analysis is domain dependent, and it is unclear how well the technology is applicable to iCBT. This paper presents an empirical study in which automated sentiment analysis by an algorithm for the Dutch language is validated against human judgment. METHODS: A total of 493 iCBT user texts were evaluated on overall sentiment and the presence of five specific emotions by an algorithm, and by 52 psychology students who evaluated 75 randomly selected texts each, providing about eight human evaluations per text. Inter-rater agreement (IRR) between algorithm and humans, and humans among each other, was analyzed by calculating the intra-class correlation under a numerical interpretation of the data, and Cohen's kappa, and Krippendorff's alpha under a categorical interpretation. RESULTS: All analyses indicated moderate agreement between the algorithm and average human judgment with respect to evaluating overall sentiment, and low agreement for the specific emotions. Somewhat surprisingly, the same was the case for the IRR among human judges, which means that the algorithm performed about as well as a randomly selected human judge. Thus, considering average human judgment as a benchmark for the applicability of automated sentiment analysis, the technique can be considered for practical application. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The low human-human agreement on the presence of emotions may be due to the nature of the texts, it may simply be difficult for humans to agree on the presence of the selected emotions, or perhaps trained therapists would have reached more consensus. Future research may focus on validating the algorithm against a more solid benchmark, on applying the algorithm in an application in which empathic feedback is provided, for example, by an embodied conversational agent, or on improving the algorithm for the iCBT domain with a bottom-up machine learning approach.",2019,,Front Psychol,10,,1065,,10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01065,31156504,#5086,Provoost 2019,"",""
A Hybrid Deep Learning Model Using Grid Search and Cross-Validation for Effective Classification and Prediction of Suicidal Ideation from Social Network Data.,Chadha A; Kaushik B,"Suicide deaths due to depression and mental stress are growing rapidly at an alarming rate.

Closing the Psychological Treatment Gap During the COVID-19 Pandemic With a Supportive Text Messaging Program: Protocol for Implementation and Evaluation.,Agyapong VIO; Hrabok M; Vuong W; Gusnowski A; Shalaby R; Mrklas K; Li D; Urichuk L; Snaterse M; Surood S; Cao B; Li XM; Greiner R; Greenshaw AJ,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread globally with far-reaching, significant, and unprecedented impacts on health and everyday life. Threats to mental health, psychological safety, and well-being are now emerging, increasing the impact of this virus on world health. Providing support for these challenges is difficult because of the high number of people requiring support in the context of a need to maintain physical distancing. This protocol describes the use of SMS text messaging (Text4Hope) as a convenient, cost-effective, and accessible population-level mental health intervention. This program is evidence-based, with prior research supporting good outcomes and high user satisfaction. OBJECTIVE: The project goal is to implement a program of daily supportive SMS text messaging (Text4Hope) to reduce distress related to the COVID-19 crisis, initially among Canadians. The prevalence of stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms; the demographic correlates of the same; and the outcomes of the Text4Hope intervention in mitigating distress will be evaluated. METHODS: Self-administered anonymous online questionnaires will be used to assess stress (Perceived Stress Scale), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale [GAD-7]), and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]). Data will be collected at baseline (onset of SMS text messaging), the program midpoint (6 weeks), and the program endpoint (12 weeks). RESULTS: Data analysis will include parametric and nonparametric techniques, focusing on primary outcomes (ie, stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms) and metrics of use, including the number of subscribers and user satisfaction. Given the large size of the data set, machine learning and data mining methods will also be used. CONCLUSIONS: This COVID-19 project will provide key information regarding prevalence rates of stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms during the pandemic; demographic correlates of distress; and outcome data related to this scalable population-level intervention.

These embeddings were used to train a feedforward neural network for predicting trait values. Their generalization performances have been evaluated through two external validation studies involving experts (N = 11) and laypeople (N = 100) in a discrimination task about the best markers of each trait and polarity. RESULTS: Intrinsic validation of the model yielded excellent results, with R(2) values greater than 0.78. The validation studies showed a high proportion of matches between participants' choices and model predictions, confirming its efficacy in identifying new terms related to the OCEAN traits. The best performance was observed for agreeableness and extraversion, especially for their positive polarities.

Detection of emotion by text analysis using machine learning.,Machová K; Szabóova M; Paralič J; Mičko J,"Emotions are an integral part of human life. We know many different definitions of emotions. They are most often defined as a complex pattern of reactions, and they could be confused with feelings or moods. They are the way in which individuals cope with matters or situations that they find personally significant. Emotion can also be characterized as a conscious mental reaction (such as anger or fear) subjectively experienced as a strong feeling, usually directed at a specific object. Emotions can be communicated in different ways. Understanding the emotions conveyed in a text or speech of a human by a machine is one of the challenges in the field of human-machine interaction. The article proposes the artificial intelligence approach to automatically detect human emotions, enabling a machine (i.e., a chatbot) to accurately assess emotional state of a human and to adapt its communication accordingly. A complete automation of this process is still a problem. This gap can be filled with machine learning approaches based on automatic learning from experiences represented by the text data from conversations. We conducted experiments with a lexicon-based approach and classic methods of machine learning, appropriate for text processing, such as Naïve Bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM) and with deep learning using neural networks (NN) to develop a model for detecting emotions in a text. We have compared these models' effectiveness. The NN detection model performed particularly well in a multi-classification task involving six emotions from the text data. It achieved an F1-score = 0.95 for sadness, among other high scores for other emotions. We also verified the best model in use through a web application and in a Chatbot communication with a human. We created a web application based on our detection model that can analyze a text input by web user and detect emotions expressed in a text of a post or a comment. The model for emotions detection was used also to improve the communication of the Chatbot with a human since the Chatbot has the information about emotional state of a human during communication. Our research demonstrates the potential of machine learning approaches to detect emotions from a text and improve human-machine interaction. However, it is important to note that full automation of an emotion detection is still an open research question, and further work is needed to improve the accuracy and robustness of this system.

Drawing on a 2021 U.S. nationally representative survey, we coded text responses to an open-ended question on stressful life events and conducted descriptive and regression analyses (n = 1733). The analyses revealed three key findings. First, men were more likely to report having experienced no stressful life events or else mention politics as a source of stress. Women, by comparison, were more likely to report the following as stressful-inability to socialize, paid work, care work, health, or the death of loved ones. Second, for both women and men, respondents reporting no stressful life events had the lowest, and those reporting finances as the most stressful life event had the highest, depressive symptoms. Third, women had higher depressive symptoms than men, and mediation analysis showed that stressful life events explained approximately a third of the gender gap in depressive symptoms.

Psychosis Relapse Prediction Leveraging Electronic Health Records Data and Natural Language Processing Enrichment Methods.,Lee DY; Kim C; Lee S; Son SJ; Cho SM; Cho YH; Lim J; Park RW,"BACKGROUND: Identifying patients at a high risk of psychosis relapse is crucial for early interventions. A relevant psychiatric clinical context is often recorded in clinical notes; however, the utilization of unstructured data remains limited. This study aimed to develop psychosis-relapse prediction models using various types of clinical notes and structured data. METHODS: Clinical data were extracted from the electronic health records of the Ajou University Medical Center in South Korea. The study population included patients with psychotic disorders, and outcome was psychosis relapse within 1 year. Using only structured data, we developed an initial prediction model, then three natural language processing (NLP)-enriched models using three types of clinical notes (psychological tests, admission notes, and initial nursing assessment) and one complete model. Latent Dirichlet Allocation was used to cluster the clinical context into similar topics. All models applied the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression algorithm. We also performed an external validation using another hospital database. RESULTS: A total of 330 patients were included, and 62 (18.8%) experienced psychosis relapse. Six predictors were used in the initial model and 10 additional topics from Latent Dirichlet Allocation processing were added in the enriched models. The model derived from all notes showed the highest value of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC = 0.946) in the internal validation, followed by models based on the psychological test notes, admission notes, initial nursing assessments, and structured data only (0.902, 0.855, 0.798, and 0.784, respectively). The external validation was performed using only the initial nursing assessment note, and the AUROC was 0.616. CONCLUSIONS: We developed prediction models for psychosis relapse using the NLP-enrichment method. Models using clinical notes were more effective than models using only structured data, suggesting the importance of unstructured data in psychosis prediction.",2022,,Front Psychiatry,13,,844442,,10.3389/fpsyt.2022.844442,35479497,#5127,Lee 2022,"",""
Emergence of Language Related to Self-experience and Agency in Autobiographical Narratives of Individuals With Schizophrenia.,Chan CC; Norel R; Agurto C; Lysaker PH; Myers EJ; Hazlett EA; Corcoran CM; Minor KS; Cecchi GA,"BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS: Disturbances in self-experience are a central feature of schizophrenia and its study can enhance phenomenological understanding and inform mechanisms underlying clinical symptoms. Self-experience involves the sense of self-presence, of being the subject of one's own experiences and agent of one's own actions, and of being distinct from others. Self-experience is traditionally assessed by manual rating of interviews; however, natural language processing (NLP) offers automated approach that can augment manual ratings by rapid and reliable analysis of text. STUDY DESIGN: We elicited autobiographical narratives from 167 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (SZ) and 90 healthy controls (HC), amounting to 490 000 words and 26 000 sentences. We used NLP techniques to examine transcripts for language related to self-experience, machine learning to validate group differences in language, and canonical correlation analysis to examine the relationship between language and symptoms. STUDY RESULTS: Topics related to self-experience and agency emerged as significantly more expressed in SZ than HC (P < 10-13) and were decoupled from similarly emerging features such as emotional tone, semantic coherence, and concepts related to burden. Further validation on hold-out data showed that a classifier trained on these features achieved patient-control discrimination with AUC = 0.80 (P < 10-5). Canonical correlation analysis revealed significant relationships between self-experience and agency language features and clinical symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Notably, the self-experience and agency topics emerged without any explicit probing by the interviewer and can be algorithmically detected even though they involve higher-order metacognitive processes. These findings illustrate the utility of NLP methods to examine phenomenological aspects of schizophrenia.",2023,Mar,Schizophr Bull,49,2,444-453,,10.1093/schbul/sbac126,36184074,#5128,Chan 2023,"",""
Multi-Head Attention-Based Long Short-Term Memory for Depression Detection From Speech.,Zhao Y; Liang Z; Du J; Zhang L; Liu C; Zhao L,"Depression is a mental disorder that threatens the health and normal life of people. Hence, it is essential to provide an effective way to detect depression. However, research on depression detection mainly focuses on utilizing different parallel features from audio, video, and text for performance enhancement regardless of making full usage of the inherent information from speech. To focus on more emotionally salient regions of depression speech, in this research, we propose a multi-head time-dimension attention-based long short-term memory (LSTM) model. We first extract frame-level features to store the original temporal relationship of a speech sequence and then analyze their difference between speeches of depression and those of health status. Then, we study the performance of various features and use a modified feature set as the input of the LSTM layer. Instead of using the output of the traditional LSTM, multi-head time-dimension attention is employed to obtain more key time information related to depression detection by projecting the output into different subspaces. The experimental results show the proposed model leads to improvements of 2.3 and 10.3% over the LSTM model on the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus-Wizard of Oz (DAIC-WOZ) and the Multi-modal Open Dataset for Mental-disorder Analysis (MODMA) corpus, respectively.",2021,,Front Neurorobot,15,,684037,,10.3389/fnbot.2021.684037,34512301,#5134,Zhao 2021,"",""
Acoustic and Text Features Analysis for Adult ADHD Screening: A Data-Driven Approach Utilizing DIVA Interview.,Li S; Nair R; Naqvi SM,"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder commonly seen in childhood that leads to behavioural changes in social development and communication patterns, often continues into undiagnosed adulthood due to a global shortage of psychiatrists, resulting in delayed diagnoses with lasting consequences on individual's well-being and the societal impact. Recently, machine learning methodologies have been incorporated into healthcare systems to facilitate the diagnosis and enhance the potential prediction of treatment outcomes for mental health conditions. In ADHD detection, the previous research focused on utilizing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or Electroencephalography (EEG) signals, which require costly equipment and trained personnel for data collection. In recent years, speech and text modalities have garnered increasing attention due to their cost-effectiveness and non-wearable sensing in data collection. In this research, conducted in collaboration with the Cumbria, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust, we gathered audio data from both ADHD patients and normal controls based on the clinically popular Diagnostic Interview for ADHD in adults (DIVA). Subsequently, we transformed the speech data into text modalities through the utilization of the Google Cloud Speech API. We extracted both acoustic and text features from the data, encompassing traditional acoustic features (e.g., MFCC), specialized feature sets (e.g., eGeMAPS), as well as deep-learned linguistic and semantic features derived from pre-trained deep learning models. These features are employed in conjunction with a support vector machine for ADHD classification, yielding promising outcomes in the utilization of audio and text data for effective adult ADHD screening. Clinical impact: This research introduces a transformative approach in ADHD diagnosis, employing speech and text analysis to facilitate early and more accessible detection, particularly beneficial in areas with limited psychiatric resources.

Towards automated detection of psychosocial risk factors with text mining.,Uronen L; Moen H; Teperi S; Martimo KP; Hartiala J; Salanterä S,"BACKGROUND: Psychosocial risk factors influence early retirement and absence from work. Health checks by occupational health nurses (OHNs) may prevent deterioration of work ability. Health checks are documented electronically mostly as free text, and therefore the effect of psychological risk factors on working capacity is difficult to detect. AIMS: To evaluate the potential of text mining for automated early detection of psychosocial risk factors by examining health check free-text documentation, which may indicate medical statements recommending early retirement, prolonged sick leave or rehabilitation. Psychosocial risk factors were extracted from OHN documentation in a nationwide occupational health care registry. METHODS: Analysis of health check documentation and medical statements regarding pension, sick leave and rehabilitation. Annotations of 13 psychosocial factors based on the Prima-EF standard (PAS 1010) were used with a combination of unsupervised machine learning, a document search engine and manual filtering. RESULTS: Health check documentation was analysed for 7078 employees. In 83% of their health checks, psychosocial risk factors were mentioned. All of these occurred more frequently in the group that received medical statements for pension, rehabilitation or sick leave than the group that did not receive medical statement. Documentation of career development and work control indicated future loss of work ability. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that it was possible to detect risk factors for sick leave, rehabilitation and pension from free-text documentation of health checks.

Automatic classification of RDoC positive valence severity with a neural network.,Clark C; Wellner B; Davis R; Aberdeen J; Hirschman L,"OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to develop a machine learning-based system to determine the severity of Positive Valance symptoms for a patient, based on information included in their initial psychiatric evaluation. Severity was rated on an ordinal scale of 0-3 as follows: 0 (absent=no symptoms), 1 (mild=modest significance), 2 (moderate=requires treatment), 3 (severe=causes substantial impairment) by experts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We treated the task of assigning Positive Valence severity as a text classification problem. During development, we experimented with regularized multinomial logistic regression classifiers, gradient boosted trees, and feedforward, fully-connected neural networks. We found both regularization and feature selection via mutual information to be very important in preventing models from overfitting the data. Our best configuration was a neural network with three fully connected hidden layers with rectified linear unit activations. RESULTS: Our best performing system achieved a score of 77.86%. The evaluation metric is an inverse normalization of the Mean Absolute Error presented as a percentage number between 0 and 100, where 100 means the highest performance. Error analysis showed that 90% of the system errors involved neighboring severity categories. CONCLUSION: Machine learning text classification techniques with feature selection can be trained to recognize broad differences in Positive Valence symptom severity with a modest amount of training data (in this case 600 documents, 167 of which were unannotated). An increase in the amount of annotated data can increase accuracy of symptom severity classification by several percentage points.

Early treatment is associated with better outcomes and improved quality of life. In this paper, the authors aimed to identify features associated with patients with iNPH using natural language processing (NLP) to characterize this cohort, with the intention to later target the development of artificial intelligence-driven tools for early detection. METHODS: The electronic health records of patients with shunt-responsive iNPH were retrospectively reviewed using an NLP algorithm. Participants were selected from a prospectively maintained single-center database of patients undergoing CSF diversion for probable iNPH (March 2008-July 2020). Analysis was conducted on preoperative health records including clinic letters, referrals, and radiology reports accessed through CogStack. Clinical features were extracted from these records as SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms) concepts using a named entity recognition machine learning model. In the first phase, a base model was generated using unsupervised training on 1 million electronic health records and supervised training with 500 double-annotated documents. The model was fine-tuned to improve accuracy using 300 records from patients with iNPH double annotated by two blinded assessors. Thematic analysis of the concepts identified by the machine learning algorithm was performed, and the frequency and timing of terms were analyzed to describe this patient group. RESULTS: In total, 293 eligible patients responsive to CSF diversion were identified. The median age at CSF diversion was 75 years, with a male predominance (69% male). The algorithm performed with a high degree of precision and recall (F1 score 0.92). Thematic analysis revealed the most frequently documented symptoms related to mobility, cognitive impairment, and falls or balance. The most frequent comorbidities were related to cardiovascular and hematological problems. CONCLUSIONS: This model demonstrates accurate, automated recognition of iNPH features from medical records.

Identifying subtypes of depression in clinician-annotated text: a retrospective cohort study.,Kung B; Chiang M; Perera G; Pritchard M; Stewart R,"Current criteria for depression are imprecise and do not accurately characterize its distinct clinical presentations. As a result, its diagnosis lacks clinical utility in both treatment and research settings. Data-driven efforts to refine criteria have typically focused on a limited set of symptoms that do not reflect the disorder's heterogeneity. By contrast, clinicians often write about patients in depth, creating descriptions that may better characterize depression. However, clinical text is not commonly used to this end. Here we show that clinically relevant depressive subtypes can be derived from unstructured electronic health records. Five subtypes were identified amongst 18,314 patients with depression treated at a large mental healthcare provider by using unsupervised machine learning: severe-typical, psychotic, mild-typical, agitated, and anergic-apathetic. Subtypes were used to place patients in groups for validation; groups were found to be associated with future outcomes and characteristics that were consistent with the subtypes. These associations suggest that these categorizations are actionable due to their validity with respect to disease prognosis. Moreover, they were derived with automated techniques that might theoretically be widely implemented, allowing for future analyses in more varied populations and settings.

One important indicator of a successful OSG session is group cohesion; however, monitoring group cohesion can be challenging due to the lack of nonverbal cues and in-person interactions in text-based OSGs. The Artificial Intelligence-based Co-Facilitator (AICF) was designed to contextually identify therapeutic outcomes from conversations and produce real-time analytics. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a method to train and evaluate AICF's capacity to monitor group cohesion. METHODS: AICF used a text classification approach to extract the mentions of group cohesion within conversations. A sample of data was annotated by human scorers, which was used as the training data to build the classification model. The annotations were further supported by finding contextually similar group cohesion expressions using word embedding models as well. AICF performance was also compared against the natural language processing software Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC). RESULTS: AICF was trained on 80,000 messages obtained from Cancer Chat Canada. We tested AICF on 34,048 messages. Human experts scored 6797 (20%) of the messages to evaluate the ability of AICF to classify group cohesion. Results showed that machine learning algorithms combined with human input could detect group cohesion, a clinically meaningful indicator of effective OSGs. After retraining with human input, AICF reached an F(1)-score of 0.82. AICF performed slightly better at identifying group cohesion compared to LIWC. CONCLUSIONS: AICF has the potential to assist therapists by detecting discord in the group amenable to real-time intervention.

In adolescents, increasing suicidality during antidepressant treatment further complicates the problem. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate digital biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment response of depression in adolescents through a newly developed smartphone app. METHODS: We developed the Smart Healthcare System for Teens At Risk for Depression and Suicide app for Android-based smartphones. This app passively collected data reflecting the social and behavioral activities of adolescents, such as their smartphone usage time, physical movement distance, and the number of phone calls and text messages during the study period. Our study consisted of 24 adolescents (mean age 15.4 [SD 1.4] years, 17 girls) with major depressive disorder (MDD) diagnosed with Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime Version and 10 healthy controls (mean age 13.8 [SD 0.6] years, 5 girls). After 1 week's baseline data collection, adolescents with MDD were treated with escitalopram in an 8-week, open-label trial. Participants were monitored for 5 weeks, including the baseline data collection period. Their psychiatric status was measured every week. Depression severity was measured using the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity. The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale was administered in order to assess suicide severity. We applied the deep learning approach for the analysis of the data. Deep neural network was employed for diagnosis classification, and neural network with weighted fuzzy membership functions was used for feature selection. RESULTS: We could predict the diagnosis of depression with training accuracy of 96.3% and 3-fold validation accuracy of 77%. Of the 24 adolescents with MDD, 10 responded to antidepressant treatments. We predicted the treatment response of adolescents with MDD with training accuracy of 94.2% and 3-fold validation accuracy of 76%. Adolescents with MDD tended to move longer distances and use smartphones for longer periods of time compared to controls. The deep learning analysis showed that smartphone usage time was the most important feature in distinguishing adolescents with MDD from controls. Prominent differences were not observed in the pattern of each feature between the treatment responders and nonresponders. The deep learning analysis revealed that the total length of calls received as the most important feature predicting antidepressant response in adolescents with MDD.

A Framework for Applying Natural Language Processing in Digital Health Interventions.,Funk B; Sadeh-Sharvit S; Fitzsimmons-Craft EE; Trockel MT; Monterubio GE; Goel NJ; Balantekin KN; Eichen DM; Flatt RE; Firebaugh ML; Jacobi C; Graham AK; Hoogendoorn M; Wilfley DE; Taylor CB,"BACKGROUND: Digital health interventions (DHIs) are poised to reduce target symptoms in a scalable, affordable, and empirically supported way. DHIs that involve coaching or clinical support often collect text data from 2 sources: (1) open correspondence between users and the trained practitioners supporting them through a messaging system and (2) text data recorded during the intervention by users, such as diary entries. Natural language processing (NLP) offers methods for analyzing text, augmenting the understanding of intervention effects, and informing therapeutic decision making. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to present a technical framework that supports the automated analysis of both types of text data often present in DHIs. This framework generates text features and helps to build statistical models to predict target variables, including user engagement, symptom change, and therapeutic outcomes. METHODS: We first discussed various NLP techniques and demonstrated how they are implemented in the presented framework. We then applied the framework in a case study of the Healthy Body Image Program, a Web-based intervention trial for eating disorders (EDs). A total of 372 participants who screened positive for an ED received a DHI aimed at reducing ED psychopathology (including binge eating and purging behaviors) and improving body image. These users generated 37,228 intervention text snippets and exchanged 4285 user-coach messages, which were analyzed using the proposed model. RESULTS: We applied the framework to predict binge eating behavior, resulting in an area under the curve between 0.57 (when applied to new users) and 0.72 (when applied to new symptom reports of known users). In addition, initial evidence indicated that specific text features predicted the therapeutic outcome of reducing ED symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The case study demonstrates the usefulness of a structured approach to text data analytics. NLP techniques improve the prediction of symptom changes in DHIs. We present a technical framework that can be easily applied in other clinical trials and clinical presentations and encourage other groups to apply the framework in similar contexts.",2020,Feb,J Med Internet Res,22,2,e13855,,10.2196/13855,32130118,#5184,Funk 2020,"",""
Identifying epilepsy psychiatric comorbidities with machine learning.,Glauser T; Santel D; DelBello M; Faist R; Toon T; Clark P; McCourt R; Wissel B; Pestian J,"OBJECTIVE: People with epilepsy are at increased risk for mental health comorbidities. Machine-learning methods based on spoken language can detect suicidality in adults. This study's purpose was to use spoken words to create machine-learning classifiers that identify current or lifetime history of comorbid psychiatric conditions in teenagers and young adults with epilepsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eligible participants were >12 years old with epilepsy. All participants were interviewed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) or the MINI Kid Tracking and asked five open-ended conversational questions. N-grams and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) word categories were used to construct machine learning classification models from language harvested from interviews. Data were analyzed for four individual MINI identified disorders and for three mutually exclusive groups: participants with no psychiatric disorders, participants with non-suicidal psychiatric disorders, and participants with any degree of suicidality. Performance was measured using areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AROCs). RESULTS: Classifiers were constructed from 227 interviews with 122 participants (7.5 ± 3.1 minutes and 454 ± 299 words). AROCs for models differentiating the non-overlapping groups and individual disorders ranged 57%-78% (many with P < .02).

Closing the COVID-19 Psychological Treatment Gap for Cancer Patients in Alberta: Protocol for the Implementation and Evaluation of Text4Hope-Cancer Care.,Agyapong VIO; Hrabok M; Shalaby R; Mrklas K; Vuong W; Gusnowski A; Surood S; Greenshaw AJ; Nkire N,"BACKGROUND: Cancer diagnoses and treatments usually engender significant anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients, close relatives, and caregivers. Providing psychological support during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic presents additional challenges due to self-isolation and social or physical distancing measures in place to limit viral spread. This protocol describes the use of text messaging (Text4Hope-Cancer Care) as a convenient, cost-effective, and accessible population-level mental health intervention. As demonstrated in previous research, this evidence-based program supports good outcomes and high user satisfaction. OBJECTIVE: We will implement daily supportive text messaging as a way of reducing and managing anxiety and depression related to cancer diagnosis and treatment in Alberta, Canada. Prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms, their demographic correlates, and Text4Hope-Cancer Care-induced changes in anxiety and depression will be evaluated. METHODS: Alberta residents with a cancer diagnosis and the close relatives of those dealing with a cancer diagnosis can self-subscribe to the Text4Hope-Cancer Care program by texting ""CancerCare"" to a dedicated text number. Self-administered, anonymous, online questionnaires will be used to assess anxiety and depressive symptoms using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Data will be collected at onset from individuals receiving text messages, and at the mid- and endpoints of the program (ie, at 6 and 12 weeks, respectively). Data will be analyzed with parametric and nonparametric statistics for primary outcomes (ie, anxiety and depressive symptoms) and usage metrics, including the number of subscribers and user satisfaction. In addition, data mining and machine learning analysis will focus on determining subscriber characteristics that predict high levels of symptoms of mental disorders, and may subsequently predict changes in those measures in response to the Text4Hope-Cancer Care program. RESULTS: The first research stage, which was completed in April 2020, involved the creation and review of the supportive text messages and uploading of messages into a web-based text messaging service. The second stage, involving the launch of the Text4Hope-Cancer Care program, occurred in May 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Text4Hope-Cancer Care has the potential to provide key information regarding the prevalence rates of anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients diagnosed or receiving care for cancer and their caregivers. The study will generate demographic correlates of anxiety and depression, and outcome data related to this scalable, population-level intervention. Information from this study will be valuable for health care practitioners working in cancer care and may help inform policy and decision making regarding psychological interventions for cancer care.

Risk Factors Associated With Nonfatal Opioid Overdose Leading to Intensive Care Unit Admission: A Cross-sectional Study.,Mitra A; Ahsan H; Li W; Liu W; Kerns RD; Tsai J; Becker W; Smelson DA; Yu H,"BACKGROUND: Opioid overdose (OD) and related deaths have significantly increased in the United States over the last 2 decades. Existing studies have mostly focused on demographic and clinical risk factors in noncritical care settings. Social and behavioral determinants of health (SBDH) are infrequently coded in the electronic health record (EHR) and usually buried in unstructured EHR notes, reflecting possible gaps in clinical care and observational research. Therefore, SBDH often receive less attention despite being important risk factors for OD. Natural language processing (NLP) can alleviate this problem. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were two-fold: First, we examined the usefulness of NLP for SBDH extraction from unstructured EHR text, and second, for intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, we investigated risk factors including SBDH for nonfatal OD. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of admission data from the EHR of patients in the ICU of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012. We used patient admission data and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnoses to extract demographics, nonfatal OD, SBDH, and other clinical variables. In addition to obtaining SBDH information from the ICD codes, an NLP model was developed to extract 6 SBDH variables from EHR notes, namely, housing insecurity, unemployment, social isolation, alcohol use, smoking, and illicit drug use. We adopted a sequential forward selection process to select relevant clinical variables. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the associations with nonfatal OD, and relative risks were quantified as covariate-adjusted odds ratios (aOR). RESULTS: The strongest association with nonfatal OD was found to be drug use disorder (aOR 8.17, 95% CI 5.44-12.27), followed by bipolar disorder (aOR 2.69, 95% CI 1.68-4.29). Among others, major depressive disorder (aOR 2.57, 95% CI 1.12-5.88), being on a Medicaid health insurance program (aOR 2.26, 95% CI 1.43-3.58), history of illicit drug use (aOR 2.09, 95% CI 1.15-3.79), and current use of illicit drugs (aOR 2.06, 95% CI 1.20-3.55) were strongly associated with increased risk of nonfatal OD. Conversely, Blacks (aOR 0.51, 95% CI 0.28-0.94), older age groups (40-64 years: aOR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44-0.96; >64 years: aOR 0.16, 95% CI 0.08-0.34) and those with tobacco use disorder (aOR 0.53, 95% CI 0.32-0.89) or alcohol use disorder (aOR 0.64, 95% CI 0.42-1.00) had decreased risk of nonfatal OD. Moreover, 99.82% of all SBDH information was identified by the NLP model, in contrast to only 0.18% identified by the ICD codes. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to analyze the risk factors for nonfatal OD in an ICU setting using NLP-extracted SBDH from EHR notes. We found several risk factors associated with nonfatal OD including SBDH. SBDH are richly described in EHR notes, supporting the importance of integrating NLP-derived SBDH into OD risk assessment. More studies in ICU settings can help health care systems better understand and respond to the opioid epidemic.",2021,Nov,JMIR Med Inform,9,11,e32851,,10.2196/32851,34747714,#5197,Mitra 2021,"",""
Exploring the association between problem drinking and language use on Facebook in young adults.,Marengo D; Azucar D; Giannotta F; Basile V; Settanni M,"Recent literature suggests that variations in both formal and content aspects of texts shared on social media tend to reflect user-level differences in demographic, psychosocial, and behavioral characteristics.

We collected texts shared on Facebook by a sample of 296 adult social media users (66.9% females; mean age = 28.44 years (SD = 7.38)). Texts were mined using the closed-vocabulary approach based on the Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC) semantic dictionary, and an open-vocabulary approach performed via Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Then, we examined associations between emerging textual features and alcohol-drinking scores as assessed using the AUDIT-C questionnaire. As a final aim, we employed the Random Forest machine-learning algorithm to determine and compare the predictive accuracy of closed- and open-vocabulary features over users' AUDIT-C scores. We found use of words about family, school, and positive feelings and emotions to be negatively associated with alcohol use and problematic drinking, while words suggesting interest in sport events, politics and economics, nightlife, and use of coarse language were more frequent among problematic drinkers. Results coming from LIWC and LDA analyses were quite similar, but LDA added information that could not be retrieved only with LIWC analysis. Furthermore, open-vocabulary features outperformed closed-vocabulary features in terms of predictive power over participants' AUDIT-C scores (r = .46 vs. r = .28, respectively).

Online forums dedicated to PPD can provide a practical setting where women can better manage their mental health in the peripartum period. Data from such forums can be systematically analyzed to understand the technology and information needs of women experiencing PPD. However, deeper insights are needed on how best to translate information derived from online forum data into digital health features. In this study, we aim to adapt a digital health development framework, Digilego, toward translation of our results from social media analysis to inform digital features of a mobile intervention that promotes PPD prevention and self-management. The first step in our adaption was to conduct a user need analysis through semi-automated analysis of peer interactions in two highly popular PPD online forums: What to Expect and BabyCenter. This included the development of a machine learning pipeline that allowed us to automatically classify user post content according to major communication themes that manifested in the forums. This was followed by mapping the results of our user needs analysis to existing behavior change and engagement optimization models. Our analysis has revealed major themes being discussed by users of these online forums- family and friends, medications, symptom disclosure, breastfeeding, and social support in the peripartum period. Our results indicate that Random Forest was the best performing model in automatic text classification of user posts, when compared to Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression models. Computerized text analysis revealed that posts had an average length of 94 words, and had a balance between positive and negative emotions. Our Digilego-powered theory mapping also indicated that digital platforms dedicated to PPD prevention and management should contain features ranging from educational content on practical aspects of the peripartum period to inclusion of collaborative care processes that support shared decision making, as well as forum moderation strategies to address issues with cyberbullying.",2021,,Front Digit Health,3,,653769,,10.3389/fdgth.2021.653769,34713126,#5208,Zingg 2021,"",""
Robust diagnosis recommendation system for Primary Care Telemedicine using long short-term memory multi-class sequence classification.,Essay P; Rajasekharan A,"BACKGROUND: Telemedicine offers opportunity for robust diagnoses recommendations to support healthcare providers intra-consultation in a way that does not limit providers ability to explore diagnostic codes and make the most appropriate selection for each consultation. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work was to develop a recommendation system for ICD-10 coding using multiclass sequence classification and deep learning. The recommendations are intended to support telemedicine clinicians in making timely and appropriate diagnosis selections. The recommendations allow clinicians to find and select the best diagnosis code much quicker and without leaving the telemedicine platform to search codes and code descriptions. METHODS: We developed an LSTM model for multi-class text sequence classification to make diagnosis recommendations. The LSTM recommender used text-based symptoms, complaints, and consultation request reasons as model inputs. Data were extracted from a live telemedicine platform which spans general medicine, dermatology, and mental health clinical specialties. A popularity-based model was used for baseline comparison. RESULTS: Using over 2.8 MM telemedicine consultations during 2021 and 2022, our LSTM recommender average accuracy was 31.7%. LSTM recommender average coverage in the top 20 recommended diagnoses was 85.8% with an average personalization score of 0.87. CONCLUSIONS: LSTM multi-class sequence classification recommends diagnoses specific to individual consultations, is retrainable on regular intervals, and could improve diagnoses recommendations such that providers require less time and resources searching for diagnosis codes. In addition, the LSTM recommender is robust enough to make recommendations across clinical specialties such as general medicine, dermatology, and mental health.",2024,Mar,Heliyon,10,6,e26770,,10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e26770,38510056,#5211,Essay 2024,"",""

Existing models for determining modifiers of clinical entities involve regular expression or features weights that are trained independently for each modifier. METHODS: We develop and evaluate a multi-task transformer architecture design where modifiers are learned and predicted jointly using the publicly available SemEval 2015 Task 14 corpus and a new Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) data set that contains modifiers shared with SemEval as well as novel modifiers specific for OUD. We evaluate the effectiveness of our multi-task learning approach versus previously published systems and assess the feasibility of transfer learning for clinical entity modifiers when only a portion of clinical modifiers are shared. RESULTS: Our approach achieved state-of-the-art results on the ShARe corpus from SemEval 2015 Task 14, showing an increase of 1.1% on weighted accuracy, 1.7% on unweighted accuracy, and 10% on micro F1 scores.

Detecting well-being via computerized content analysis of brief diary entries.,Tov W; Ng KL; Lin H; Qiu L,"Two studies evaluated the correspondence between self-reported well-being and codings of emotion and life content by the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC; Pennebaker, Booth, & Francis, 2011). Open-ended diary responses were collected from 206 participants daily for 3 weeks (Study 1) and from 139 participants twice a week for 8 weeks (Study 2). LIWC negative emotion consistently correlated with self-reported negative emotion. LIWC positive emotion correlated with self-reported positive emotion in Study 1 but not in Study 2. No correlations were observed with global life satisfaction. Using a co-occurrence coding method to combine LIWC emotion codings with life-content codings, we estimated the frequency of positive and negative events in 6 life domains (family, friends, academics, health, leisure, and money). Domain-specific event frequencies predicted self-reported satisfaction in all domains in Study 1 but not consistently in Study 2. We suggest that the correspondence between LIWC codings and self-reported well-being is affected by the number of writing samples collected per day as well as the target period (e.g., past day vs. past week) assessed by the self-report measure.

Developmental Trend of Subjective Well-Being of Weibo Users During COVID-19: Online Text Analysis Based on Machine Learning Method.,Han Y; Pan W; Li J; Zhang T; Zhang Q; Zhang E,"Currently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic experienced by the international community has increased the usage frequency of borderless, highly personalized social media platforms of all age groups. Analyzing and modeling texts sent through social media online can reveal the characteristics of the psychological dynamic state and living conditions of social media users during the pandemic more extensively and comprehensively. This study selects the Sina Weibo platform, which is highly popular in China and analyzes the subjective well-being (SWB) of Weibo users during the COVID-19 pandemic in combination with the machine learning classification algorithm. The study first invokes the SWB classification model to classify the SWB level of original texts released by 1,322 Weibo active users during the COVID-19 pandemic and then combines the latent growth curve model (LGCM) and the latent growth mixture model (LGMM) to investigate the developmental trend and heterogeneity characteristics of the SWB of Weibo users after the COVID-19 outbreak. The results present a downward trend and then an upward trend of the SWB of Weibo users during the pandemic as a whole. There was a significant correlation between the initial state and the development rate of the SWB after the COVID-19 outbreak (r = 0.36, p < 0.001). LGMM results show that there were two heterogeneous classes of the SWB after the COVID-19 outbreak, and the development rate of the SWB of the two classes was significantly different. The larger class (normal growth group; n = 1,229, 93.7%) showed a slow growth, while the smaller class (high growth group; n = 93, 6.3%) showed a rapid growth. Furthermore, the slope means across the two classes were significantly different (p < 0.001). Therefore, the individuals with a higher growth rate of SWB exhibited stronger adaptability to the changes in their living environments. These results could help to formulate effective interventions on the mental health level of the public after the public health emergency outbreak.",2021,,Front Psychol,12,,779594,,10.3389/fpsyg.2021.779594,35082723,#5230,Han 2021,"",""
A Machine Learning Approach for the Detection and Characterization of Illicit Drug Dealers on Instagram: Model Evaluation Study.,Li J; Xu Q; Shah N; Mackey TK,"BACKGROUND: Social media use is now ubiquitous, but the growth in social media communications has also made it a convenient digital platform for drug dealers selling controlled substances, opioids, and other illicit drugs. Previous studies and news investigations have reported the use of popular social media platforms as conduits for opioid sales. This study uses deep learning to detect illicit drug dealing on the image and video sharing platform Instagram. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a machine learning approach to detect Instagram posts related to illegal internet drug dealing. METHODS: In this paper, we describe an approach to detect drug dealers by using a deep learning model on Instagram. We collected Instagram posts using a Web scraper between July 2018 and October 2018 and then compared our deep learning model against 3 different machine learning models (eg, random forest, decision tree, and support vector machine) to assess the performance and accuracy of the model. For our deep learning model, we used the long short-term memory unit in the recurrent neural network to learn the pattern of the text of drug dealing posts. We also manually annotated all posts collected to evaluate our model performance and to characterize drug selling conversations. RESULTS: From the 12,857 posts we collected, we detected 1228 drug dealer posts comprising 267 unique users. We used cross-validation to evaluate the 4 models, with our deep learning model reaching 95% on F1 score and performing better than the other 3 models. We also found that by removing the hashtags in the text, the model had better performance. Detected posts contained hashtags related to several drugs, including the controlled substance Xanax (1078/1228, 87.78%), oxycodone/OxyContin (321/1228, 26.14%), and illicit drugs lysergic acid diethylamide (213/1228, 17.34%) and 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (94/1228, 7.65%). We also observed the use of communication applications for suspected drug trading through user comments. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach using a combination of Web scraping and deep learning was able to detect illegal online drug sellers on Instagram, with high accuracy. Despite increased scrutiny by regulators and policymakers, the Instagram platform continues to host posts from drug dealers, in violation of federal law. Further action needs to be taken to ensure the safety of social media communities and help put an end to this illicit digital channel of sourcing.",2019,Jun,J Med Internet Res,21,6,e13803,,10.2196/13803,31199298,#5235,Li 2019,"",""
Factors to improve distress and fatigue in Cancer survivorship; further understanding through text analysis of interviews by machine learning.,Yang K; Kim J; Chun M; Ahn MS; Chon E; Park J; Jung M,"BACKGROUND: From patient-reported surveys and individual interviews by health care providers, we attempted to identify the significant factors related to the improvement of distress and fatigue for cancer survivors by text analysis with machine learning techniques, as the secondary analysis using the single institute data from the Korean Cancer Survivorship Center Pilot Project. METHODS: Surveys and in-depth interviews from 322 cancer survivors were analyzed to identify their needs and concerns. Among the keywords in the surveys, including EQ-VAS, distress, fatigue, pain, insomnia, anxiety, and depression, distress and fatigue were focused. The interview transcripts were analyzed via Korean-based text analysis with machine learning techniques, based on the keywords used in the survey. Words were generated as vectors and similarity scores were calculated by the distance related to the text's keywords and frequency. The keywords and selected high-ranked ten words for each keyword based on the similarity were then taken to draw a network map. RESULTS: Most participants were otherwise healthy females younger than 50 years suffering breast cancer who completed treatment less than 6 months ago. As the 1-month follow-up survey's results, the improved patients were 56.5 and 58.4% in distress and fatigue scores, respectively. For the improvement of distress, dyspepsia (p = 0.006) and initial scores of distress, fatigue, anxiety, and depression (p < 0.001, < 0.001, 0.043, and 0.013, respectively) were significantly related. For the improvement of fatigue, economic state (p = 0.021), needs for rehabilitation (p = 0.035), initial score of fatigue (p < 0.001), any intervention (p = 0.017), and participation in family care program (p = 0.022) were significant. For the text analysis, Stress and Fatigue were placed at the center of the keyword network map, and words were intricately connected. From the regression anlysis combined survey scores and the quantitative variables from the text analysis, participation in family care programs and mention of family-related words were associated with the fatigue improvement (p = 0.033). CONCLUSION: Common symptoms and practical issues were related to distress and fatigue in the survey.

Most state-of-the-art applications were developed in domains such as social media, and their performance in the health care context remains relatively unknown. Moreover, existing studies indicate that these tools often lack accuracy and produce inconsistent results. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to address the lack of comparative analysis on sentiment analysis tools applied to health-related free-text survey data in the context of COVID-19. The objective was to automatically predict sentence sentiment for 2 independent COVID-19 survey data sets from the National Institutes of Health and Stanford University. METHODS: Gold standard labels were created for a subset of each data set using a panel of human raters.

In addition, few-shot learning was explored by fine-tuning Open Pre-Trained Transformers (OPT; a large language model [LLM] with publicly available weights) using a small annotated subset and zero-shot learning using ChatGPT (an LLM without available weights). RESULTS: The comparison of sentiment analysis tools revealed high variability and disagreement across the evaluated tools when applied to health-related survey data. OPT and ChatGPT demonstrated superior performance, outperforming all other sentiment analysis tools. Moreover, ChatGPT outperformed OPT, exhibited higher accuracy by 6% and higher F-measure by 4% to 7%.

Sentiment Measured in Hospital Discharge Notes Is Associated with Readmission and Mortality Risk: An Electronic Health Record Study.,McCoy TH; Castro VM; Cagan A; Roberson AM; Kohane IS; Perlis RH,"Natural language processing tools allow the characterization of sentiment--that is, terms expressing positive and negative emotion--in text. Applying such tools to electronic health records may provide insight into meaningful patient or clinician features not captured in coded data alone. We performed sentiment analysis on 2,484 hospital discharge notes for 2,010 individuals from a psychiatric inpatient unit, as well as 20,859 hospital discharges for 15,011 individuals from general medical units, in a large New England health system between January 2011 and 2014. The primary measures of sentiment captured intensity of subjective positive or negative sentiment expressed in the discharge notes. Mean scores were contrasted between sociodemographic and clinical groups in mixed effects regression models. Discharge note sentiment was then examined for association with risk for readmission in Cox regression models. Discharge notes for individuals with greater medical comorbidity were modestly but significantly lower in positive sentiment among both psychiatric and general medical cohorts (p<0.001 in each). Greater positive sentiment at discharge was associated with significantly decreased risk of hospital readmission in each cohort (~12% decrease per standard deviation above the mean).

Analyzing and Predicting User Participations in Online Health Communities: A Social Support Perspective.,Wang X; Zhao K; Street N,"BACKGROUND: Online health communities (OHCs) have become a major source of social support for people with health problems. Members of OHCs interact online with similar peers to seek, receive, and provide different types of social support, such as informational support, emotional support, and companionship. As active participations in an OHC are beneficial to both the OHC and its users, it is important to understand factors related to users' participations and predict user churn for user retention efforts. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze OHC users' Web-based interactions, reveal which types of social support activities are related to users' participation, and predict whether and when a user will churn from the OHC. METHODS: We collected a large-scale dataset from a popular OHC for cancer survivors. We used text mining techniques to decide what kinds of social support each post contained. We illustrated how we built text classifiers for 5 different social support categories: seeking informational support (SIS), providing informational support (PIS), seeking emotional support (SES), providing emotional support (PES), and companionship (COM). We conducted survival analysis to identify types of social support related to users' continued participation. Using supervised machine learning methods, we developed a predictive model for user churn. RESULTS: Users' behaviors to PIS, SES, and COM had hazard ratios significantly lower than 1 (0.948, 0.972, and 0.919, respectively) and were indicative of continued participations in the OHC. The churn prediction model based on social support activities offers accurate predictions on whether and when a user will leave the OHC.

However, social distancing has negative consequences, including increases in depression and anxiety. Digital interventions, such as text messaging, can provide accessible support on a population-wide scale. We developed text messages in English and Spanish to help individuals manage their depressive mood and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: In a two-arm randomized controlled trial, we aim to examine the effect of our 60-day text messaging intervention. Additionally, we aim to assess whether the use of machine learning to adapt the messaging frequency and content improves the effectiveness of the intervention. Finally, we will examine the differences in daily mood ratings between the message categories and time windows. METHODS: The messages were designed within two different categories: behavioral activation and coping skills. Participants will be randomized into (1) a random messaging arm, where message category and timing will be chosen with equal probabilities, and (2) a reinforcement learning arm, with a learned decision mechanism for choosing the messages. Participants in both arms will receive one message per day within three different time windows and will be asked to provide their mood rating 3 hours later. We will compare self-reported daily mood ratings; self-reported depression, using the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire; and self-reported anxiety, using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale at baseline and at intervention completion.

"Machine learning models to detect social distress, spiritual pain, and severe physical psychological symptoms in terminally ill patients with cancer from unstructured text data in electronic medical records.",Masukawa K; Aoyama M; Yokota S; Nakamura J; Ishida R; Nakayama M; Miyashita M,"BACKGROUND: Few studies have developed automatic systems for identifying social distress, spiritual pain, and severe physical and phycological symptoms from text data in electronic medical records. AIM: To develop models to detect social distress, spiritual pain, and severe physical and psychological symptoms in terminally ill patients with cancer from unstructured text data contained in electronic medical records. DESIGN: A retrospective study of 1,554,736 narrative clinical records was analyzed 1 month before patients died. Supervised machine learning models were trained to detect comprehensive symptoms, and the performance of the models was tested using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and precision recall curve (AUPRC). SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: A total of 808 patients was included in the study using records obtained from a university hospital in Japan between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2019. As training data, we used medical records labeled for detecting social distress (n = 10,000) and spiritual pain (n = 10,000), and records that could be combined with the Support Team Assessment Schedule (based on date) for detecting severe physical/psychological symptoms (n = 5409). RESULTS: Machine learning models for detecting social distress had AUROC and AUPRC values of 0.98 and 0.61, respectively; values for spiritual pain, were 0.90 and 0.58, respectively. The machine learning models accurately identified severe symptoms (pain, dyspnea, nausea, insomnia, and anxiety) with a high level of discrimination (AUROC > 0.8).

Public's Mental Health Monitoring via Sentimental Analysis of Financial Text Using Machine Learning Techniques.,Alanazi SA; Khaliq A; Ahmad F; Alshammari N; Hussain I; Zia MA; Alruwaili M; Rayan A; Alsayat A; Afsar S,"Public feelings and reactions associated with finance are gaining significant importance as they help individuals, public health, financial and non-financial institutions, and the government understand mental health, the impact of policies, and counter-response. Every individual sentiment linked with a financial text can be categorized, whether it is a headline or the detailed content published in a newspaper. The Guardian newspaper is considered one of the most famous and the biggest websites for digital media on the internet. Moreover, it can be one of the vital platforms for tracking the public's mental health and feelings via sentimental analysis of news headlines and detailed content related to finance. One of the key purposes of this study is the public's mental health tracking via the sentimental analysis of financial text news primarily published on digital media to identify the overall mental health of the public and the impact of national or international financial policies. A dataset was collected using The Guardian application programming interface and processed using the support vector machine, AdaBoost, and single layer convolutional neural network. Among all identified techniques, the single layer convolutional neural network with a classification accuracy of 0.939 is considered the best during the training and testing phases as it produced efficient performance and effective results compared to other techniques, such as support vector machine and AdaBoost with associated classification accuracies 0.677 and 0.761, respectively.

Computer-aided therapeutic diagnosis for anorexia.,Spinczyk D; Bas M; Dzieciątko M; Maćkowski M; Rojewska K; Maćkowska S,"BACKGROUND: Anorexia nervosa is a clinical disorder syndrome of the wide spectrum without a fully recognized etiology. The necessary issue in the clinical diagnostic process is to detect the causes of this disease (e.g., my body image, food, family, peers), which the therapist gradually comes to by verifying assumptions using proper methods and tools for diagnostic process. When a person is diagnosed with anorexia, a clinician (a doctor, a therapist or a psychologist) proposes a therapeutic diagnosis and considers the kind of treatment that should be applied. This process is also continued during therapeutic diagnosis. In both cases, it is recommended to apply computer-aided tools designed for testing and confirming the assumptions made by a psychologist. The paper aims to present the computer-aided therapeutic diagnosis method for anorexia. The proposed method consists of 4 stages: free statements of a patient about his/her body image, the general sentiment analysis of statement based on Recurrent Neural Network, assessment of the intensity of five basic emotions: happiness, anger, sadness, fear and disgust (using the Nencki Affective Word List and conversion of words to their basic form), and the assessment of particular areas of difficulties-the sentiment analysis based on the dictionary approach was applied. RESULTS: The sentiment analysis of a document achieved 72% and 51% of effectiveness, respectively, for RNN and dictionary-based methods. The intensity of sadness (emotion) occurring within the dictionary method is differentiated between control and research group at the level of 10%. CONCLUSION: The quick access to the sentiment analysis of a statement on the image of patient's body, emotions experienced by the patient and particular areas of difficulties of people prone to the anorexia nervosa disorders, may help to establish the diagnosis in a very short time and start an immediate therapy. The proposed automatic method helps to avoid patient's aversions towards the therapy, which may include avoiding patient-therapist communication, talking about less essential topics, coming late for the sessions. These circumstances can guarantee promising prognosis for recovering.",2020,Jun,Biomed Eng Online,19,1,53,,10.1186/s12938-020-00798-9,32560732,#5325,Spinczyk 2020,"",""
Examining spoken words and acoustic features of therapy sessions to understand family caregivers' anxiety and quality of life.,Demiris G; Oliver DP; Washington KT; Chadwick C; Voigt JD; Brotherton S; Naylor MD,"BACKGROUND: Speech and language cues are considered significant data sources that can reveal insights into one's behavior and well-being. The goal of this study is to evaluate how different machine learning (ML) classifiers trained both on the spoken word and acoustic features during live conversations between family caregivers and a therapist, correlate to anxiety and quality of life (QoL) as assessed by validated instruments. METHODS: The dataset comprised of 124 audio-recorded and professionally transcribed discussions between family caregivers of hospice patients and a therapist, of challenges they faced in their caregiving role, and standardized assessments of self-reported QoL and anxiety. We custom-built and trained an Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) system on older adult voices and created a logistic regression-based classifier that incorporated audio-based features. The classification process automated the QoL scoring and display of the score in real time, replacing hand-coding for self-reported assessments with a machine learning identified classifier. FINDINGS: Of the 124 audio files and their transcripts, 87 of these transcripts (70%) were selected to serve as the training set, holding the remaining 30% of the data for evaluation. For anxiety, the results of adding the dimension of sound and an automated speech-to-text transcription outperformed the prior classifier trained only on human-rendered transcriptions. Specifically, precision improved from 86% to 92%, accuracy from 81% to 89%, and recall from 78% to 88%. INTERPRETATION: Classifiers can be developed through ML techniques which can indicate improvements in QoL measures with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Examining the content, sound of the voice and context of the conversation provides insights into additional factors affecting anxiety and QoL that could be addressed in tailored therapy and the design of conversational agents serving as therapy chatbots.",2022,Apr,Int J Med Inform,160,,104716,,10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2022.104716,35183870,#5333,Demiris 2022,"",""
De-identification of psychiatric intake records: Overview of 2016 CEGS N-GRID shared tasks Track 1.,Stubbs A; Filannino M; Uzuner Ö,"The 2016 CEGS N-GRID shared tasks for clinical records contained three tracks. Track 1 focused on de-identification of a new corpus of 1000 psychiatric intake records. This track tackled de-identification in two sub-tracks: Track 1.A was a ""sight unseen"" task, where nine teams ran existing de-identification systems, without any modifications or training, on 600 new records in order to gauge how well systems generalize to new data. The best-performing system for this track scored an F1 of 0.799. Track 1.B was a traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) shared task on de-identification, where 15 teams had two months to train their systems on the new data, then test it on an unannotated test set. The best-performing system from this track scored an F1 of 0.914. The scores for Track 1.A show that unmodified existing systems do not generalize well to new data without the benefit of training data. The scores for Track 1.B are slightly lower than the 2014 de-identification shared task (which was almost identical to 2016 Track 1.B), indicating that these new psychiatric records pose a more difficult challenge to NLP systems.

Speech disturbances in schizophrenia: Assessing cross-linguistic generalizability of NLP automated measures of coherence.,Parola A; Lin JM; Simonsen A; Bliksted V; Zhou Y; Wang H; Inoue L; Koelkebeck K; Fusaroli R,"INTRODUCTION: Language disorders - disorganized and incoherent speech in particular - are distinctive features of schizophrenia. Natural language processing (NLP) offers automated measures of incoherent speech as promising markers for schizophrenia. However, the scientific and clinical impact of NLP markers depends on their generalizability across contexts, samples, and languages, which we systematically assessed in the present study relying on a large, novel, cross-linguistic corpus. METHODS: We collected a Danish (DK), German (GE), and Chinese (CH) cross-linguistic dataset involving transcripts from 187 participants with schizophrenia (111DK, 25GE, 51CH) and 200 matched controls (129DK, 29GE, 42CH) performing the Animated Triangles Task. Fourteen previously published NLP coherence measures were calculated, and between-groups differences and association with symptoms were tested for cross-linguistic generalizability. RESULTS: One coherence measure, i.e. second-order coherence, robustly generalized across samples and languages. We found several language-specific effects, some of which partially replicated previous findings (lower coherence in German and Chinese patients), while others did not (higher coherence in Danish patients). We found several associations between symptoms and measures of coherence, but the effects were generally inconsistent across languages and rating scales. CONCLUSIONS: Using a cumulative approach, we have shown that NLP findings of reduced semantic coherence in schizophrenia have limited generalizability across different languages, samples, and measures. We argue that several factors such as sociodemographic and clinical heterogeneity, cross-linguistic variation, and the different NLP measures reflecting different clinical aspects may be responsible for this variability. Future studies should take this variability into account in order to develop effective clinical applications targeting different patient populations.",2023,Sep,Schizophr Res,259,,59-70,,10.1016/j.schres.2022.07.002,35927097,#5347,Parola 2023,"",""
Who Benefits Most from Adding Technology to Depression Treatment and How? An Analysis of Engagement with a Texting Adjunct for Psychotherapy.,Figueroa CA; DeMasi O; Hernandez-Ramos R; Aguilera A,"Introduction: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an established treatment for depression, but its success is often impeded by low attendance. Supportive text messages assessing participants' mood in between sessions might increase attendance to in-clinic CBT, although it is not fully understood who benefits most from these interventions and how. This study examined (1) user groups showing different profiles of study engagement and (2) associations between increased response rates to mood texts and psychotherapy attendance. Methods: We included 73 participants who attended Group CBT (GCBT) in a primary care clinic and participated in a supportive automated text-messaging intervention. Using unsupervised machine learning, we identified and characterized subgroups with similar combinations of total texting responsiveness and total GCBT attendance. We used mixed-effects models to explore the association between increased previous week response rate and subsequent week in-clinic GCBT attendance and, conversely, response rate following attendance. Results: Participants could be divided into four clusters of overall study engagement, showing distinct profiles in age and prior texting knowledge. The response rate to texts in the week before GCBT was not associated with GCBT attendance, although the relationship was moderated by age; there was a positive relationship for younger, but not older, participants. Attending GCBT was, however, associated with higher response rate the week after an attended session. Conclusion: User groups of study engagement differ in texting knowledge and age. Younger participants might benefit more from supportive texting interventions when their purpose is to increase psychotherapy attendance.

Reducing readmission rates for individuals discharged from acute psychiatric care in Alberta using peer and text message support: Protocol for an innovative supportive program.,Eboreime E; Shalaby R; Mao W; Owusu E; Vuong W; Surood S; Bales K; MacMaster FP; McNeil D; Rittenbach K; Ohinmaa A; Bremault-Phillips S; Hilario C; Greiner R; Knox M; Chafe J; Coulombe J; Xin-Min L; McLean C; Rathwell R; Snaterse M; Spurvey P; Taylor VH; McLean S; Urichuk L; Tzeggai B; McCabe C; Grauwiler D; Jordan S; Brown E; Fors L; Savard T; Grunau M; Kelton F; Stauffer S; Cao B; Chue P; Abba-Aji A; Silverstone P; Nwachukwu I; Greenshaw A; Agyapong VIO,"BACKGROUND: Individuals discharged from inpatient psychiatry units have the highest readmission rates of all hospitalized patients. These readmissions are often due to unmet need for mental health care compounded by limited human resources. Reducing the need for hospital admissions by providing alternative effective care will mitigate the strain on the healthcare system and for people with mental illnesses and their relatives. We propose implementation and evaluation of an innovative program which augments Mental Health Peer Support with an evidence-based supportive text messaging program developed using the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy. METHODS: A pragmatic stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial, where daily supportive text messages (Text4Support) and mental health peer support are the interventions, will be employed. We anticipate recruiting 10,000 participants at the point of their discharge from 9 acute care psychiatry sites and day hospitals across four cities in Alberta. The primary outcome measure will be the number of psychiatric readmissions within 30 days of discharge. We will also evaluate implementation outcomes such as reach, acceptability, fidelity, and sustainability. Our study will be guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, and the Reach-Effectiveness-Adoption-Implementation-Maintenance framework. Data will be extracted from administrative data, surveys, and qualitative methods. Quantitative data will be analysed using machine learning. Qualitative interviews will be transcribed and analyzed thematically using both inductive and deductive approaches. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this will be the first large-scale clinical trial to assess the impact of a daily supportive text message program with and without mental health peer support for individuals discharged from acute psychiatric care. We anticipate that the interventions will generate significant cost-savings by reducing readmissions, while improving access to quality community mental healthcare and reducing demand for acute care. It is envisaged that the results will shed light on the effectiveness, as well as contextual barriers and facilitators to implementation of automated supportive text message and mental health peer support interventions to reduce the psychological treatment and support gap for patients who have been discharged from acute psychiatric care.

Detecting Social and Behavioral Determinants of Health with Structured and Free-Text Clinical Data.,Feller DJ; Bear Don't Walk Iv OJ; Zucker J; Yin MT; Gordon P; Elhadad N,"BACKGROUND: Social and behavioral determinants of health (SBDH) are environmental and behavioral factors that often impede disease management and result in sexually transmitted infections. Despite their importance, SBDH are inconsistently documented in electronic health records (EHRs) and typically collected only in an unstructured format. Evidence suggests that structured data elements present in EHRs can contribute further to identify SBDH in the patient record. OBJECTIVE: Explore the automated inference of both the presence of SBDH documentation and individual SBDH risk factors in patient records. Compare the relative ability of clinical notes and structured EHR data, such as laboratory measurements and diagnoses, to support inference. METHODS: We attempt to infer the presence of SBDH documentation in patient records, as well as patient status of 11 SBDH, including alcohol abuse, homelessness, and sexual orientation. We compare classification performance when considering clinical notes only, structured data only, and notes and structured data together. We perform an error analysis across several SBDH risk factors. RESULTS: Classification models inferring the presence of SBDH documentation achieved good performance (F1 score: 92.7-78.7; F1 considered as the primary evaluation metric). Performance was variable for models inferring patient SBDH risk status; results ranged from F1 = 82.7 for LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) status to F1 = 28.5 for intravenous drug use. Error analysis demonstrated that lexical diversity and documentation of historical SBDH status challenge inference of patient SBDH status. Three of five classifiers inferring topic-specific SBDH documentation and 10 of 11 patient SBDH status classifiers achieved highest performance when trained using both clinical notes and structured data. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that combining clinical free-text notes and structured data provide the best approach in classifying patient SBDH status. Inferring patient SBDH status is most challenging among SBDH with low prevalence and high lexical diversity.",2020,Jan,Appl Clin Inform,11,1,172-181,,10.1055/s-0040-1702214,32131117,#5369,Feller 2020,"",""
Automated detection of substance use information from electronic health records for a pediatric population.,Ni Y; Bachtel A; Nause K; Beal S,"OBJECTIVE: Substance use screening in adolescence is unstandardized and often documented in clinical notes, rather than in structured electronic health records (EHRs). The objective of this study was to integrate logic rules with state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning technologies to detect substance use information from both structured and unstructured EHR data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pediatric patients (10-20 years of age) with any encounter between July 1, 2012, and October 31, 2017, were included (n = 3890 patients; 19 478 encounters). EHR data were extracted at each encounter, manually reviewed for substance use (alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, opiate, any use), and coded as lifetime use, current use, or family use. Logic rules mapped structured EHR indicators to screening results. A knowledge-based NLP system and a deep learning model detected substance use information from unstructured clinical narratives. System performance was evaluated using positive predictive value, sensitivity, negative predictive value, specificity, and area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: The dataset included 17 235 structured indicators and 27 141 clinical narratives. Manual review of clinical narratives captured 94.0% of positive screening results, while structured EHR data captured 22.0%. Logic rules detected screening results from structured data with 1.0 and 0.99 for sensitivity and specificity, respectively. The knowledge-based system detected substance use information from clinical narratives with 0.86, 0.79, and 0.88 for AUC, sensitivity, and specificity, respectively.

Assessing the severity of positive valence symptoms in initial psychiatric evaluation records: Should we use convolutional neural networks?,Dai HJ; Jonnagaddala J,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Efficiently capturing the severity of positive valence symptoms could aid in risk stratification for adverse outcomes among patients with psychiatric disorders and identify optimal treatment strategies for patient subgroups. Motivated by the success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in classification tasks, we studied the application of various CNN architectures and their performance in predicting the severity of positive valence symptoms in patients with psychiatric disorders based on initial psychiatric evaluation records. METHODS: Psychiatric evaluation records contain unstructured text and semi-structured data such as question-answer pairs. For a given record, we tokenise and normalise the semi-structured content. Pre-processed tokenised words are represented as one-hot encoded word vectors. We then apply different configurations of convolutional and max pooling layers to automatically learn important features from various word representations. We conducted a series of experiments to explore the effect of different CNN architectures on the classification of psychiatric records. RESULTS: Our best CNN model achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.539 and a normalized MAE of 0.785 on the test dataset, which is comparable to the other well-known text classification algorithms studied in this work. Our results also suggest that the normalisation step has a great impact on the performance of the developed models. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that normalisation of the semi-structured contents can improve the MAE among all CNN configurations. Without advanced feature engineering, CNN-based approaches can provide a comparable solution for classifying positive valence symptom severity in initial psychiatric evaluation records. Although word embedding is well known for its ability to capture relatively low-dimensional similarity between words, our experimental results show that pre-trained embeddings do not improve the classification performance. This phenomenon may be due to the inability of word embeddings to capture problem specific contextual semantic information implying the quality of the employing embedding is critical for obtaining an accurate CNN model.",2018,,PLoS One,13,10,e0204493,,10.1371/journal.pone.0204493,30325934,#5375,Dai 2018,"",""

We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 116 English-speaking adolescents (ages 13-17 years), presenting to the ED for any reason, who reported past-year physical peer violence and current depressive symptoms. The cognitive-behavioral therapy- and motivational interviewing-based intervention consisted of a brief in-ED intervention session and 8 weeks of automated text-message daily mood queries and tailored responses. The control was a brief in-ED presentation and twice-weekly text messages on healthy behaviors. Follow-up was conducted at 8 and 16 weeks. Descriptive statistics, bivariate comparisons, mixed-effects longitudinal regression models, and latent class models (LCMs) were calculated. iDOVE had high acceptability and feasibility, with 86% of eligible youth consenting (n = 116), 95% completing 8-week follow-up, and 91% completing 16-week follow-up. High quantitative and qualitative satisfaction were reported by intervention and control participants. Comparing intervention to control, improved depressive symptoms (p = .07) and physical peer violence (p = .01) were observed among the more symptomatic youth in the intervention group (but no difference in symptoms between full intervention and control groups). LCMs showed that intervention responsiveness correlated with lower mood (measured through daily text messages) at Day 7 of the intervention. This RCT of a technology-augmented intervention shows high feasibility and acceptability and a promising signal of reduced violence among the highest-risk participants.

Cognitive Impairments in Schizophrenia: A Study in a Large Clinical Sample Using Natural Language Processing.,Mascio A; Stewart R; Botelle R; Williams M; Mirza L; Patel R; Pollak T; Dobson R; Roberts A,"Background: Cognitive impairments are a neglected aspect of schizophrenia despite being a major factor of poor functional outcome. They are usually measured using various rating scales, however, these necessitate trained practitioners and are rarely routinely applied in clinical settings. Recent advances in natural language processing techniques allow us to extract such information from unstructured portions of text at a large scale and in a cost effective manner. We aimed to identify cognitive problems in the clinical records of a large sample of patients with schizophrenia, and assess their association with clinical outcomes. Methods: We developed a natural language processing based application identifying cognitive dysfunctions from the free text of medical records, and assessed its performance against a rating scale widely used in the United Kingdom, the cognitive component of the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS). Furthermore, we analyzed cognitive trajectories over the course of patient treatment, and evaluated their relationship with various socio-demographic factors and clinical outcomes. Results: We found a high prevalence of cognitive impairments in patients with schizophrenia, and a strong correlation with several socio-demographic factors (gender, education, ethnicity, marital status, and employment) as well as adverse clinical outcomes. Results obtained from the free text were broadly in line with those obtained using the HoNOS subscale, and shed light on additional associations, notably related to attention and social impairments for patients with higher education. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that cognitive problems are common in patients with schizophrenia, can be reliably extracted from clinical records using natural language processing, and are associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Harvesting the free text from medical records provides a larger coverage in contrast to neurocognitive batteries or rating scales, and access to additional socio-demographic and clinical variables.

Using natural language processing to study homelessness longitudinally with electronic health record data subject to irregular observations.,Chapman AB; Scharfstein DO; Montgomery AE; Byrne T; Suo Y; Effiong A; Velasquez T; Pettey W; Nelson RE,"The Electronic Health Record (EHR) contains information about social determinants of health (SDoH) such as homelessness. Much of this information is contained in clinical notes and can be extracted using natural language processing (NLP). This data can provide valuable information for researchers and policymakers studying long-term housing outcomes for individuals with a history of homelessness. However, studying homelessness longitudinally in the EHR is challenging due to irregular observation times. In this work, we applied an NLP system to extract housing status for a cohort of patients in the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) over a three-year period. We then applied inverse intensity weighting to adjust for the irregularity of observations, which was used generalized estimating equations to estimate the probability of unstable housing each day after entering a VA housing assistance program. Our methods generate unique insights into the long-term outcomes of individuals with a history of homelessness and demonstrate the potential for using EHR data for research and policymaking.",2023,,AMIA Annu Symp Proc,2023,,894-903,,,38222404,#5400,Chapman 2023,"",""
Extraction of clinical phenotypes for Alzheimer's disease dementia from clinical notes using natural language processing.,Oh IY; Schindler SE; Ghoshal N; Lai AM; Payne PRO; Gupta A,"OBJECTIVES: There is much interest in utilizing clinical data for developing prediction models for Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, progression, and outcomes. Existing studies have mostly utilized curated research registries, image analysis, and structured electronic health record (EHR) data. However, much critical information resides in relatively inaccessible unstructured clinical notes within the EHR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a natural language processing (NLP)-based pipeline to extract AD-related clinical phenotypes, documenting strategies for success and assessing the utility of mining unstructured clinical notes. We evaluated the pipeline against gold-standard manual annotations performed by 2 clinical dementia experts for AD-related clinical phenotypes including medical comorbidities, biomarkers, neurobehavioral test scores, behavioral indicators of cognitive decline, family history, and neuroimaging findings. RESULTS: Documentation rates for each phenotype varied in the structured versus unstructured EHR. Interannotator agreement was high (Cohen's kappa = 0.72-1) and positively correlated with the NLP-based phenotype extraction pipeline's performance (average F1-score = 0.65-0.99) for each phenotype. DISCUSSION: We developed an automated NLP-based pipeline to extract informative phenotypes that may improve the performance of eventual machine learning predictive models for AD. In the process, we examined documentation practices for each phenotype relevant to the care of AD patients and identified factors for success. CONCLUSION: Success of our NLP-based phenotype extraction pipeline depended on domain-specific knowledge and focus on a specific clinical domain instead of maximizing generalizability.",2023,Apr,JAMIA Open,6,1,ooad014,Dryad/10.5061/dryad.0vt4b8h3g,10.1093/jamiaopen/ooad014,36844369,#5403,Oh 2023,"",""
A Pseudo-Value Approach to Analyze the Semantic Similarity of the Speech of Children With and Without Autism Spectrum Disorder.,Adams JR; Salem AC; MacFarlane H; Ingham R; Bedrick SD; Fombonne E; Dolata JK; Hill AP; van Santen J,"Conversational impairments are well known among people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but their measurement requires time-consuming manual annotation of language samples. Natural language processing (NLP) has shown promise in identifying semantic difficulties when compared to clinician-annotated reference transcripts. Our goal was to develop a novel measure of lexico-semantic similarity - based on recent work in natural language processing (NLP) and recent applications of pseudo-value analysis - which could be applied to transcripts of children's conversational language, without recourse to some ground-truth reference document. We hypothesized that: (a) semantic coherence, as measured by this method, would discriminate between children with and without ASD and (b) more variability would be found in the group with ASD. We used data from 70 4- to 8-year-old males with ASD (N = 38) or typically developing (TD; N = 32) enrolled in a language study. Participants were administered a battery of standardized diagnostic tests, including the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS). ADOS was recorded and transcribed, and we analyzed children's language output during the conversation/interview ADOS tasks. Transcripts were converted to vectors via a word2vec model trained on the Google News Corpus. Pairwise similarity across all subjects and a sample grand mean were calculated. Using a leave-one-out algorithm, a pseudo-value, detailed below, representing each subject's contribution to the grand mean was generated. Means of pseudo-values were compared between the two groups. Analyses were co-varied for nonverbal IQ, mean length of utterance, and number of distinct word roots (NDR). Statistically significant differences were observed in means of pseudo-values between TD and ASD groups (p = 0.007). TD subjects had higher pseudo-value scores suggesting that similarity scores of TD subjects were more similar to the overall group mean. Variance of pseudo-values was greater in the ASD group. Nonverbal IQ, mean length of utterance, or NDR did not account for between group differences. The findings suggest that our pseudo-value-based method can be effectively used to identify specific semantic difficulties that characterize children with ASD without requiring a reference transcript.",2021,,Front Psychol,12,,668344,,10.3389/fpsyg.2021.668344,34366986,#5413,Adams 2021,"",""
"Detection of Suicidal Ideation on Social Media: Multimodal, Relational, and Behavioral Analysis.",Ramírez-Cifuentes D; Freire A; Baeza-Yates R; Puntí J; Medina-Bravo P; Velazquez DA; Gonfaus JM; Gonzàlez J,"BACKGROUND: Suicide risk assessment usually involves an interaction between doctors and patients. However, a significant number of people with mental disorders receive no treatment for their condition due to the limited access to mental health care facilities; the reduced availability of clinicians; the lack of awareness; and stigma, neglect, and discrimination surrounding mental disorders. In contrast, internet access and social media usage have increased significantly, providing experts and patients with a means of communication that may contribute to the development of methods to detect mental health issues among social media users. OBJECTIVE: This paper aimed to describe an approach for the suicide risk assessment of Spanish-speaking users on social media. We aimed to explore behavioral, relational, and multimodal data extracted from multiple social platforms and develop machine learning models to detect users at risk. METHODS: We characterized users based on their writings, posting patterns, relations with other users, and images posted. We also evaluated statistical and deep learning approaches to handle multimodal data for the detection of users with signs of suicidal ideation (suicidal ideation risk group). Our methods were evaluated over a dataset of 252 users annotated by clinicians. To evaluate the performance of our models, we distinguished 2 control groups: users who make use of suicide-related vocabulary (focused control group) and generic random users (generic control group). RESULTS: We identified significant statistical differences between the textual and behavioral attributes of each of the control groups compared with the suicidal ideation risk group. At a 95% CI, when comparing the suicidal ideation risk group and the focused control group, the number of friends (P=.04) and median tweet length (P=.04) were significantly different. The median number of friends for a focused control user (median 578.5) was higher than that for a user at risk (median 372.0). Similarly, the median tweet length was higher for focused control users, with 16 words against 13 words of suicidal ideation risk users. Our findings also show that the combination of textual, visual, relational, and behavioral data outperforms the accuracy of using each modality separately. We defined text-based baseline models based on bag of words and word embeddings, which were outperformed by our models, obtaining an increase in accuracy of up to 8% when distinguishing users at risk from both types of control users. CONCLUSIONS: The types of attributes analyzed are significant for detecting users at risk, and their combination outperforms the results provided by generic, exclusively text-based baseline models. After evaluating the contribution of image-based predictive models, we believe that our results can be improved by enhancing the models based on textual and relational features. These methods can be extended and applied to different use cases related to other mental disorders.",2020,Jul,J Med Internet Res,22,7,e17758,,10.2196/17758,32673256,#5421,Ramírez-Cifuentes 2020,"",""
Racial Differences in Stigmatizing and Positive Language in Emergency Medicine Notes.,Boley S; Sidebottom A; Vacquier M; Watson D; Van Eyll B; Friedman S,"OBJECTIVE: Language used by providers in medical documentation may reveal evidence of race-related implicit bias. We aimed to use natural language processing (NLP) to examine if prevalence of stigmatizing language in emergency medicine (EM) encounter notes differs across patient race/ethnicity. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort of EM encounters, NLP techniques identified stigmatizing and positive themes. Logistic regression models analyzed the association of race/ethnicity and themes within notes. Outcomes were the presence (or absence) of 7 different themes: 5 stigmatizing (difficult, non-compliant, skepticism, substance abuse/seeking, and financial difficulty) and 2 positive (compliment and compliant). RESULTS: The sample included notes from 26,363 unique patients. NH Black patient notes were less likely to contain difficult (odds ratio (OR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.73-0.88), skepticism (OR 0.87, 95% CI, 0.79-0.96), and substance abuse/seeking (OR 0.62, 95% CI, 0.56-0.70) compared to NH White patient notes but more likely to contain non-compliant (OR 1.26, 95% CI, 1.17-1.36) and financial difficulty (OR 1.14, 95% CI, 1.04-1.25).

Clinical documentation of patient-reported medical cannabis use in primary care: Toward scalable extraction using natural language processing methods.,Carrell DS; Cronkite DJ; Shea M; Oliver M; Luce C; Matson TE; Bobb JF; Hsu C; Binswanger IA; Browne KC; Saxon AJ; McCormack J; Jelstrom E; Ghitza UE; Campbell CI; Bradley KA; Lapham GT,"Background: Most states have legalized medical cannabis, yet little is known about how medical cannabis use is documented in patients' electronic health records (EHRs). We used natural language processing (NLP) to calculate the prevalence of clinician-documented medical cannabis use among adults in an integrated health system in Washington State where medical and recreational use are legal. Methods: We analyzed EHRs of patients ≥18 years old screened for past-year cannabis use (November 1, 2017-October 31, 2018), to identify clinician-documented medical cannabis use. We defined medical use as any documentation of cannabis that was recommended by a clinician or described by the clinician or patient as intended to manage health conditions or symptoms. We developed and applied an NLP system that included NLP-assisted manual review to identify such documentation in encounter notes. Results: Medical cannabis use was documented for 16,684 (5.6%) of 299,597 outpatient encounters with routine screening for cannabis use among 203,489 patients seeing 1,274 clinicians. The validated NLP system identified 54% of documentation and NLP-assisted manual review the remainder. Language documenting reasons for cannabis use included 125 terms indicating medical use, 28 terms indicating non-medical use and 41 ambiguous terms. Implicit documentation of medical use (e.g., ""edible THC nightly for lumbar pain"") was more common than explicit (e.g., ""continues medical cannabis use""). Conclusions: Clinicians use diverse and often ambiguous language to document patients' reasons for cannabis use.

Development of depression detection algorithm using text scripts of routine psychiatric interview.,Oh J; Lee T; Chung ES; Kim H; Cho K; Choi J; Sim HH; Lee J; Choi IY; Kim DJ,"BACKGROUND: A psychiatric interview is one of the important procedures in diagnosing psychiatric disorders. Through this interview, psychiatrists listen to the patient's medical history and major complaints, check their emotional state, and obtain clues for clinical diagnosis. Although there have been attempts to diagnose a specific mental disorder from a short doctor-patient conversation, there has been no attempt to classify the patient's emotional state based on the text scripts from a formal interview of more than 30 min and use it to diagnose depression. This study aimed to utilize the existing machine learning algorithm in diagnosing depression using the transcripts of one-on-one interviews between psychiatrists and depressed patients. METHODS: Seventy-seven clinical patients [with depression (n = 60); without depression (n = 17)] with a prior psychiatric diagnosis history participated in this study. The study was conducted with 24 male and 53 female subjects with the mean age of 33.8 (± 3.0). Psychiatrists conducted a conversational interview with each patient that lasted at least 30 min. All interviews with the subjects between August 2021 and November 2022 were recorded and transcribed into text scripts, and a text emotion recognition module was used to indicate the subject's representative emotions of each sentence. A machine learning algorithm discriminates patients with depression and those without depression based on text scripts. RESULTS: A machine learning model classified text scripts from depressive patients with non-depressive ones with an acceptable accuracy rate (AUC of 0.85). The distribution of emotions (surprise, fear, anger, love, sadness, disgust, neutral, and happiness) was significantly different between patients with depression and those without depression (p < 0.001), and the most contributing emotion in classifying the two groups was disgust (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This is a qualitative and retrospective study to develop a tool to detect depression against patients without depression based on the text scripts of psychiatric interview, suggesting a novel and practical approach to understand the emotional characteristics of depression patients and to use them to detect the diagnosis of depression based on machine learning methods. This model could assist psychiatrists in clinical settings who conduct routine conversations with patients using text transcripts of the interviews.",2023,,Front Psychiatry,14,,1256571,,10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1256571,38239906,#5426,Oh 2023,"",""
Sentiment Analysis of Online Reviews for Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors.,Compagner C; Lester C; Dorsch M,"BACKGROUND: Depression affects millions worldwide, with drug therapy being the mainstay treatment. A variety of factors, including personal reviews, are involved in the success or failure of medication therapy. This study looked to characterize the sentiment of online medication reviews of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor (SNRIs) used to treat depression. METHODS: The publicly available data source used was the Drug Review Dataset from the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contained the following variables: ID, drug name, condition, review, rating, date, and usefulness count. This study utilized a sentiment analysis of free-text, online reviews via the sentimentr package. A Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparisons. RESULTS: The average sentiment was higher in SSRIs compared to SNRIs (0.065 vs. 0.005, p < 0.001). The average sentiment was also found to be higher in high-rated reviews than in low-rated reviews (0.169 vs. -0.367, p < 0.001). Ratings were similar in the high-rated SSRI group and high-rated SNRI group (9.19 vs. 9.19). CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the use of sentiment analysis using the AFINN lexicon, as the lexicon showed a difference in sentiment between high-rated reviews from low-rated reviews. This study also found that SNRIs have more negative sentiment and lower-rated reviews than SSRIs.",2021,Jan,Pharmacy (Basel),9,1,,,10.3390/pharmacy9010027,33498697,#5436,Compagner 2021,"",""
Can acute suicidality be predicted by Instagram data? Results from qualitative and quantitative language analyses.,Brown RC; Bendig E; Fischer T; Goldwich AD; Baumeister H; Plener PL,"BACKGROUND: Social media has become increasingly important for communication among young people. It is also often used to communicate suicidal ideation. AIMS: To investigate the link between acute suicidality and language use as well as activity on Instagram. METHOD: A total of 52 participants, aged on average around 16 years, who had posted pictures of non-suicidal self-injury on Instagram, and reported a lifetime history of suicidal ideation, were interviewed using Instagram messenger. Of those participants, 45.5% reported suicidal ideation on the day of the interview (acute suicidal ideation). Qualitative text analysis (software ATLAS.ti 7) was used to investigate experiences with expressions of active suicidal thoughts on Instagram. Quantitative text analysis of language use in the interviews and directly on Instagram (in picture captions) was performed using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count software. Language markers in the interviews and in picture captions, as well as activity on Instagram were added to regression analyses, in order to investigate predictors for current suicidal ideation. RESULTS: Most participants (80%) had come across expressions of active suicidal thoughts on Instagram and 25% had expressed active suicidal thoughts themselves. Participants with acute suicidal ideation used significantly more negative emotion words (Cohen's d = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.088-1.232) and words expressing overall affect (Cohen's d = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.001-1.138) in interviews. However, activity and language use on Instagram did not predict acute suicidality.

Detecting autism from picture book narratives using deep neural utterance embeddings.,Wawer A; Chojnicka I,"BACKGROUND: Deficits in the ability to use language in social contexts, including storytelling skills, are observed across the autism spectrum. Development in machine-learning approaches may contribute to clinical psychology and psychiatry, given its potential to support decisions concerning the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric conditions and disorders. AIMS: To evaluate the usefulness of deep neural networks for detecting autism spectrum disorder (ASD) from textual utterances, specifically from narrations produced by individuals with ASD. METHODS & PROCEDURES: We examined two text encoders: Embeddings from Language Models (ELMo) and Universal Sentence Encoder (USE), and three classification algorithms: XGBoost, support vector machines, and dense neural network layer. We aimed to classify 25 participants with ASD and 25 participants with typical development (TD) based on their narrations produced during the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition (ADOS-2) picture book task. The results of computational approaches were compared with the results of standardized testing and classifications made by two psychiatrists (raters). The raters were asked to read utterances produced by a participant (without an examiner's statements and additional information) and assign a participant to one of the two groups: ASD or with typical development (TD). OUTCOMES & RESULTS: The computer-based models had higher sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values and negative predictive values than the raters, and lower than the two standardized instruments: ADOS-2 and Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ). CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS: Our findings lay the groundwork for future studies involving deep neural network-based text representation models as tools for augmenting the ASD diagnosis or screening. Both ELMo and USE text encoders provided promising specificities, sensitivities, positive predictive values and negative predictive values. Our results indicate the usefulness of page-level embeddings for utterance representation in ADOS-2 picture book task. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: What is already known on this subject Deficits in the use of language in social contexts, and narrative ability in particular, are observed across the autism spectrum. Most research on narrative skills has applied hand-coding methods. Hitherto, machine-learning methods were used mostly for image recognition problems and data from screening questionnaires for ASD classification. Detection of mental and developmental disorders from textual input is an emerging field for machine and deep-learning methods. What this paper adds to existing knowledge This study explored the ability of several types of deep neural network-based text representation models to detect ASD. Both ELMo and USE provided the most promising values of specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive values and negative predictive values. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? Competitive accuracy, repeatability, speed and ease of operation are all advantages of computerized methods.

Question-answering system extracts information on injection drug use from clinical notes.,Mahbub M; Goethert I; Danciu I; Knight K; Srinivasan S; Tamang S; Rozenberg-Ben-Dror K; Solares H; Martins S; Trafton J; Begoli E; Peterson GD,"BACKGROUND: Injection drug use (IDU) can increase mortality and morbidity. Therefore, identifying IDU early and initiating harm reduction interventions can benefit individuals at risk. However, extracting IDU behaviors from patients' electronic health records (EHR) is difficult because there is no other structured data available, such as International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes, and IDU is most often documented in unstructured free-text clinical notes. Although natural language processing can efficiently extract this information from unstructured data, there are no validated tools. METHODS: To address this gap in clinical information, we design a question-answering (QA) framework to extract information on IDU from clinical notes for use in clinical operations. Our framework involves two main steps: (1) generating a gold-standard QA dataset and (2) developing and testing the QA model. We use 2323 clinical notes of 1145 patients curated from the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Corporate Data Warehouse to construct the gold-standard dataset for developing and evaluating the QA model. We also demonstrate the QA model's ability to extract IDU-related information from temporally out-of-distribution data. RESULTS: Here, we show that for a strict match between gold-standard and predicted answers, the QA model achieves a 51.65% F1 score. For a relaxed match between the gold-standard and predicted answers, the QA model obtains a 78.03% F1 score, along with 85.38% Precision and 79.02% Recall scores. Moreover, the QA model demonstrates consistent performance when subjected to temporally out-of-distribution data.

Feedback from women who underwent medical termination of pregnancy about their experience is crucial to help practitioners identify women's needs and develop necessary tools to improve the abortion care process. However, the collection of this feedback is quite challenging. Social media offer anonymity for women who share their abortion experience. OBJECTIVE: This exploratory infodemiology study aimed to analyze, through French social media posts, personal medical symptoms and the different experiences and information dynamics associated with the medical abortion process. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed by analyzing posts geolocated in France and published from January 1, 2017, to November 30, 2021. Posts were extracted from all French-language general and specialized publicly available web forums using specific keywords. Extracted messages were cleaned and pseudonymized. Automatic natural language processing methods were used to identify posts from women having experienced medical abortion. Biterm topic modeling was used to identify the main discussion themes and the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities was used to identify medical terms. Encountered difficulties were explored using qualitative research methods until the saturation of concepts was reached. RESULTS: Analysis of 5398 identified posts (3409 users) led to the identification of 9 major topics: personal experience (n=2413 posts, 44.7%), community support (n=1058, 19.6%), pain and bleeding (n=797, 14.8%), psychological experience (n=760, 14.1%), questioned efficacy (n=410, 7.6%), social pressure (n=373, 6.9%), positive experiences (n=257, 4.8%), menstrual cycle disorders (n=107, 2%), and reported inefficacy (n=104, 1.9%). Pain, which was mentioned in 1627 (30.1%) of the 5398 posts by 1024 (30.0%) of the 3409 users, was the most frequently reported medical term. Pain was considered severe to unbearable in 24.5% of the cases (399 of the 1627 posts). Lack of information was the most frequently reported difficulty during and after the process.

Automated analysis of speech as a marker of sub-clinical psychotic experiences.,Olah J; Spencer T; Cummins N; Diederen K,"Automated speech analysis techniques, when combined with artificial intelligence and machine learning, show potential in capturing and predicting a wide range of psychosis symptoms, garnering attention from researchers. These techniques hold promise in predicting the transition to clinical psychosis from at-risk states, as well as relapse or treatment response in individuals with clinical-level psychosis. However, challenges in scientific validation hinder the translation of these techniques into practical applications. Although sub-clinical research could aid to tackle most of these challenges, there have been only few studies conducted in speech and psychosis research in non-clinical populations. This work aims to facilitate this work by summarizing automated speech analytical concepts and the intersection of this field with psychosis research. We review psychosis continuum and sub-clinical psychotic experiences, and the benefits of researching them. Then, we discuss the connection between speech and psychotic symptoms.

Negativity and Positivity in the ICU: Exploratory Development of Automated Sentiment Capture in the Electronic Health Record.,Kennedy CJ; Chiu C; Chapman AC; Gologorskaya O; Farhan H; Han M; Hodgson M; Lazzareschi D; Ashana D; Lee S; Smith AK; Espejo E; Boscardin J; Pirracchio R; Cobert J,"OBJECTIVES: To develop proof-of-concept algorithms using alternative approaches to capture provider sentiment in ICU notes. DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study. SETTING: The Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring of Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) deidentified notes databases. PATIENTS: Adult (≥18 yr old) patients admitted to the ICU. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We developed two sentiment models: 1) a keywords-based approach using a consensus-based clinical sentiment lexicon comprised of 72 positive and 103 negative phrases, including negations and 2) a Decoding-enhanced Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers with disentangled attention-v3-based deep learning model (keywords-independent) trained on clinical sentiment labels. We applied the models to 198,944 notes across 52,997 ICU admissions in the MIMIC-III database. Analyses were replicated on an external sample of patients admitted to a UCSF ICU from 2018 to 2019. We also labeled sentiment in 1,493 note fragments and compared the predictive accuracy of our tools to three popular sentiment classifiers. Clinical sentiment terms were found in 99% of patient visits across 88% of notes. Our two sentiment tools were substantially more predictive (Spearman correlations of 0.62-0.84, p values < 0.00001) of labeled sentiment compared with general language algorithms (0.28-0.46).

Drug side effect extraction from clinical narratives of psychiatry and psychology patients.,Sohn S; Kocher JP; Chute CG; Savova GK,"OBJECTIVE: To extract physician-asserted drug side effects from electronic medical record clinical narratives. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pattern matching rules were manually developed through examining keywords and expression patterns of side effects to discover an individual side effect and causative drug relationship. A combination of machine learning (C4.5) using side effect keyword features and pattern matching rules was used to extract sentences that contain side effect and causative drug pairs, enabling the system to discover most side effect occurrences. Our system was implemented as a module within the clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System. RESULTS: The system was tested in the domain of psychiatry and psychology. The rule-based system extracting side effects and causative drugs produced an F score of 0.80 (0.55 excluding allergy section). The hybrid system identifying side effect sentences had an F score of 0.75 (0.56 excluding allergy section) but covered more side effect and causative drug pairs than individual side effect extraction. DISCUSSION: The rule-based system was able to identify most side effects expressed by clear indication words. More sophisticated semantic processing is required to handle complex side effect descriptions in the narrative. We demonstrated that our system can be trained to identify sentences with complex side effect descriptions that can be submitted to a human expert for further abstraction. CONCLUSION: Our system was able to extract most physician-asserted drug side effects. It can be used in either an automated mode for side effect extraction or semi-automated mode to identify side effect sentences that can significantly simplify abstraction by a human expert.",2011,Dec,J Am Med Inform Assoc,18 Suppl 1,Suppl 1,i144-9,,10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000351,21946242,#5490,Sohn 2011,"",""

We conducted a large-scale, natural language processing (NLP) analysis of conversations on opioid-related drug forums to better understand concerns among people who use opioids. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, we analyzed posts from 14 opioid-related forums on the social network Reddit. We applied NLP to identify frequently mentioned substances and phrases, and grouped the phrases manually based on their contents into three broad key themes: (i) prescription and/or illegal opioid use; (ii) substance use disorder treatment access and care; and (iii) withdrawal. Phrases that were unmappable to any particular theme were discarded. We computed the frequencies of substance and theme mentions, and quantified their volumes over time. We compared changes in post volumes by key themes and substances between pre-COVID-19 (1/1/2019-2/29/2020) and COVID-19 (3/1/2020-11/30/2020) periods. RESULTS: Seventy-seven thousand six hundred fifty-two and 119,168 posts were collected for the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods, respectively. By theme, posts about treatment and access to care increased by 300%, from 0.631 to 2.526 per 1000 posts between the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods. Conversations about withdrawal increased by 812% between the same periods (0.026 to 0.235 per 1,000 posts). Posts about drug use did not increase (0.219 to 0.218 per 1,000 posts). By substance, among medications for opioid use disorder, methadone had the largest increase in conversations (20.751 to 56.313 per 1,000 posts; 171.4% increase). Among other medications, posts about diphenhydramine exhibited the largest increase (0.341 to 0.927 per 1,000 posts; 171.8% increase).

A Motivational Interviewing Chatbot With Generative Reflections for Increasing Readiness to Quit Smoking: Iterative Development Study.,Brown A; Kumar AT; Melamed O; Ahmed I; Wang YH; Deza A; Morcos M; Zhu L; Maslej M; Minian N; Sujaya V; Wolff J; Doggett O; Iantorno M; Ratto M; Selby P; Rose J,"BACKGROUND: The motivational interviewing (MI) approach has been shown to help move ambivalent smokers toward the decision to quit smoking. There have been several attempts to broaden access to MI through text-based chatbots. These typically use scripted responses to client statements, but such nonspecific responses have been shown to reduce effectiveness. Recent advances in natural language processing provide a new way to create responses that are specific to a client's statements, using a generative language model. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to design, evolve, and measure the effectiveness of a chatbot system that can guide ambivalent people who smoke toward the decision to quit smoking with MI-style generative reflections. METHODS: Over time, 4 different MI chatbot versions were evolved, and each version was tested with a separate group of ambivalent smokers. A total of 349 smokers were recruited through a web-based recruitment platform. The first chatbot version only asked questions without reflections on the answers. The second version asked the questions and provided reflections with an initial version of the reflection generator. The third version used an improved reflection generator, and the fourth version added extended interaction on some of the questions. Participants' readiness to quit was measured before the conversation and 1 week later using an 11-point scale that measured 3 attributes related to smoking cessation: readiness, confidence, and importance. The number of quit attempts made in the week before the conversation and the week after was surveyed; in addition, participants rated the perceived empathy of the chatbot. The main body of the conversation consists of 5 scripted questions, responses from participants, and (for 3 of the 4 versions) generated reflections. A pretrained transformer-based neural network was fine-tuned on examples of high-quality reflections to generate MI reflections. RESULTS: The increase in average confidence using the nongenerative version was 1.0 (SD 2.0; P=.001), whereas for the 3 generative versions, the increases ranged from 1.2 to 1.3 (SD 2.0-2.3; P<.001). The extended conversation with improved generative reflections was the only version associated with a significant increase in average importance (0.7, SD 2.0; P<.001) and readiness (0.4, SD 1.7; P=.01). The enhanced reflection and extended conversations exhibited significantly better perceived empathy than the nongenerative conversation (P=.02 and P=.004, respectively). The number of quit attempts did not significantly change between the week before the conversation and the week after across all 4 conversations. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that generative reflections increase the impact of a conversation on readiness to quit smoking 1 week later, although a significant portion of the impact seen so far can be achieved by only asking questions without the reflections. These results support further evolution of the chatbot conversation and can serve as a basis for comparison against more advanced versions.",2023,Oct,JMIR Ment Health,10,,e49132,,10.2196/49132,37847539,#5528,Brown 2023,"",""

The advent of generative artificial intelligence language models presents a promising solution. The perspective of clinicians may contribute to effective and responsible implementation of such tools. This study sought to evaluate 3 uses for generative artificial intelligence for clinical documentation in pediatric emergency medicine, measuring time savings, effort reduction, and physician attitudes and identifying potential risks and barriers. METHODS: This mixed-methods study was performed with 10 pediatric emergency medicine attending physicians from a single pediatric emergency department. Participants were asked to write a supervisory note for 4 clinical scenarios, with varying levels of complexity, twice without any assistance and twice with the assistance of ChatGPT Version 4.0. Participants evaluated 2 additional ChatGPT-generated clinical summaries: a structured handoff and a visit summary for a family written at an 8th grade reading level. Finally, a semistructured interview was performed to assess physicians' perspective on the use of ChatGPT in pediatric emergency medicine. Main outcomes and measures included between subjects' comparisons of the effort and time taken to complete the supervisory note with and without ChatGPT assistance. Effort was measured using a self-reported Likert scale of 0 to 10. Physicians' scoring of and attitude toward the ChatGPT-generated summaries were measured using a 0 to 10 Likert scale and open-ended questions. Summaries were scored for completeness, accuracy, efficiency, readability, and overall satisfaction. A thematic analysis was performed to analyze the content of the open-ended questions and to identify key themes. RESULTS: ChatGPT yielded a 40% reduction in time and a 33% decrease in effort for supervisory notes in intricate cases, with no discernible effect on simpler notes. ChatGPT-generated summaries for structured handoffs and family letters were highly rated, ranging from 7.0 to 9.0 out of 10, and most participants favored their inclusion in clinical practice. However, there were several critical reservations, out of which a set of general recommendations for applying ChatGPT to clinical summaries was formulated.

METHODS: Japanese transcribed interviews with 53 dementia patients and caregivers were used. A new morpheme selection method using Z-scores was developed to identify trends in describing the latent needs. F-measures with and without the new method were compared using three machine learning models. RESULTS: The F-measures with the new method were higher for the support vector machine (SVM) (F-measure of 0.81 with the new method and F-measure of 0.79 without the new method for patients) and Naive Bayes (F-measure of 0.69 with the new method and F-measure of 0.67 without the new method for caregivers and F-measure of 0.75 with the new method and F-measure of 0.73 without the new method for patients). CONCLUSION: A new scheme based on Z-score adaptation for machine learning models was developed to predict the latent needs of dementia patients and their caregivers by extracting data from interviews in Japanese.

"An Empathy-Driven, Conversational Artificial Intelligence Agent (Wysa) for Digital Mental Well-Being: Real-World Data Evaluation Mixed-Methods Study.",Inkster B; Sarda S; Subramanian V,"BACKGROUND: A World Health Organization 2017 report stated that major depression affects almost 5% of the human population. Major depression is associated with impaired psychosocial functioning and reduced quality of life. Challenges such as shortage of mental health personnel, long waiting times, perceived stigma, and lower government spends pose barriers to the alleviation of mental health problems. Face-to-face psychotherapy alone provides only point-in-time support and cannot scale quickly enough to address this growing global public health challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled, empathetic, and evidence-driven conversational mobile app technologies could play an active role in filling this gap by increasing adoption and enabling reach. Although such a technology can help manage these barriers, they should never replace time with a health care professional for more severe mental health problems. However, app technologies could act as a supplementary or intermediate support system. Mobile mental well-being apps need to uphold privacy and foster both short- and long-term positive outcomes. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to present a preliminary real-world data evaluation of the effectiveness and engagement levels of an AI-enabled, empathetic, text-based conversational mobile mental well-being app, Wysa, on users with self-reported symptoms of depression. METHODS: In the study, a group of anonymous global users were observed who voluntarily installed the Wysa app, engaged in text-based messaging, and self-reported symptoms of depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. On the basis of the extent of app usage on and between 2 consecutive screening time points, 2 distinct groups of users (high users and low users) emerged. The study used mixed-methods approach to evaluate the impact and engagement levels among these users. The quantitative analysis measured the app impact by comparing the average improvement in symptoms of depression between high and low users. The qualitative analysis measured the app engagement and experience by analyzing in-app user feedback and evaluated the performance of a machine learning classifier to detect user objections during conversations. RESULTS: The average mood improvement (ie, difference in pre- and post-self-reported depression scores) between the groups (ie, high vs low users; n=108 and n=21, respectively) revealed that the high users group had significantly higher average improvement (mean 5.84 [SD 6.66]) compared with the low users group (mean 3.52 [SD 6.15]); Mann-Whitney P=.03 and with a moderate effect size of 0.63. Moreover, 67.7% of user-provided feedback responses found the app experience helpful and encouraging.

Traditional methods for detecting the risk of depression, predominantly reliant on psychiatric evaluations and self-assessment questionnaires, are often criticized for their inefficiency and lack of objectivity. Advancements in deep learning have paved the way for innovations in depression risk detection methods that fuse multimodal data. This paper introduces a novel framework, the Audio, Video, and Text Fusion-Three Branch Network (AVTF-TBN), designed to amalgamate auditory, visual, and textual cues for a comprehensive analysis of depression risk. Our approach encompasses three dedicated branches-Audio Branch, Video Branch, and Text Branch-each responsible for extracting salient features from the corresponding modality. These features are subsequently fused through a multimodal fusion (MMF) module, yielding a robust feature vector that feeds into a predictive modeling layer. To further our research, we devised an emotion elicitation paradigm based on two distinct tasks-reading and interviewing-implemented to gather a rich, sensor-based depression risk detection dataset. The sensory equipment, such as cameras, captures subtle facial expressions and vocal characteristics essential for our analysis. The research thoroughly investigates the data generated by varying emotional stimuli and evaluates the contribution of different tasks to emotion evocation. During the experiment, the AVTF-TBN model has the best performance when the data from the two tasks are simultaneously used for detection, where the F1 Score is 0.78, Precision is 0.76, and Recall is 0.81.

SIMON: A Digital Protocol to Monitor and Predict Suicidal Ideation.,Sels L; Homan S; Ries A; Santhanam P; Scheerer H; Colla M; Vetter S; Seifritz E; Galatzer-Levy I; Kowatsch T; Scholz U; Kleim B,"Each year, more than 800,000 persons die by suicide, making it a leading cause of death worldwide. Recent innovations in information and communication technology may offer new opportunities in suicide prevention in individuals, hereby potentially reducing this number. In our project, we design digital indices based on both self-reports and passive mobile sensing and test their ability to predict suicidal ideation, a major predictor for suicide, and psychiatric hospital readmission in high-risk individuals: psychiatric patients after discharge who were admitted in the context of suicidal ideation or a suicidal attempt, or expressed suicidal ideations during their intake. Specifically, two smartphone applications -one for self-reports (SIMON-SELF) and one for passive mobile sensing (SIMON-SENSE)- are installed on participants' smartphones. SIMON-SELF uses a text-based chatbot, called Simon, to guide participants along the study protocol and to ask participants questions about suicidal ideation and relevant other psychological variables five times a day. These self-report data are collected for four consecutive weeks after study participants are discharged from the hospital. SIMON-SENSE collects behavioral variables -such as physical activity, location, and social connectedness- parallel to the first application. We aim to include 100 patients over 12 months to test whether (1) implementation of the digital protocol in such a high-risk population is feasible, and (2) if suicidal ideation and psychiatric hospital readmission can be predicted using a combination of psychological indices and passive sensor information. To this end, a predictive algorithm for suicidal ideation and psychiatric hospital readmission using various learning algorithms (e.g., random forest and support vector machines) and multilevel models will be constructed. Data collected on the basis of psychological theory and digital phenotyping may, in the future and based on our results, help reach vulnerable individuals early and provide links to just-in-time and cost-effective interventions or establish prompt mental health service contact.

Identifying Symptom Information in Clinical Notes Using Natural Language Processing.,Koleck TA; Tatonetti NP; Bakken S; Mitha S; Henderson MM; George M; Miaskowski C; Smaldone A; Topaz M,"BACKGROUND: Symptoms are a core concept of nursing interest. Large-scale secondary data reuse of notes in electronic health records (EHRs) has the potential to increase the quantity and quality of symptom research. However, the symptom language used in clinical notes is complex. A need exists for methods designed specifically to identify and study symptom information from EHR notes. OBJECTIVES: We aim to describe a method that combines standardized vocabularies, clinical expertise, and natural language processing to generate comprehensive symptom vocabularies and identify symptom information in EHR notes. We piloted this method with five diverse symptom concepts: constipation, depressed mood, disturbed sleep, fatigue, and palpitations. METHODS: First, we obtained synonym lists for each pilot symptom concept from the Unified Medical Language System. Then, we used two large bodies of text (clinical notes from Columbia University Irving Medical Center and PubMed abstracts containing Medical Subject Headings or key words related to the pilot symptoms) to further expand our initial vocabulary of synonyms for each pilot symptom concept. We used NimbleMiner, an open-source natural language processing tool, to accomplish these tasks and evaluated NimbleMiner symptom identification performance by comparison to a manually annotated set of nurse- and physician-authored common EHR note types. RESULTS: Compared to the baseline Unified Medical Language System synonym lists, we identified up to 11 times more additional synonym words or expressions, including abbreviations, misspellings, and unique multiword combinations, for each symptom concept. Natural language processing system symptom identification performance was excellent.

Depression screening using mobile phone usage metadata: a machine learning approach.,Razavi R; Gharipour A; Gharipour M,"OBJECTIVE: Depression is currently the second most significant contributor to non-fatal disease burdens globally. While it is treatable, depression remains undiagnosed in many cases. As mobile phones have now become an integral part of daily life, this study examines the possibility of screening for depressive symptoms continuously based on patients' mobile usage patterns. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 412 research participants reported a range of their mobile usage statistics. Beck Depression Inventory-2nd ed (BDI-II) was used to measure the severity of depression among participants. A wide array of machine learning classification algorithms was trained to detect participants with depression symptoms (ie, BDI-II score ≥ 14). The relative importance of individual variables was additionally quantified. RESULTS: Participants with depression were found to have fewer saved contacts on their devices, spend more time on their mobile devices to make and receive fewer and shorter calls, and send more text messages than participants without depression. The best model was a random forest classifier, which had an out-of-sample balanced accuracy of 0.768. The balanced accuracy increased to 0.811 when participants' age and gender were included. DISCUSSIONS/CONCLUSION: The significant predictive power of mobile usage attributes implies that, by collecting mobile usage statistics, mental health mobile applications can continuously screen for depressive symptoms for initial diagnosis or for monitoring the progress of ongoing treatments.

Voice features were found to be more accurate, sensitive and specific in the classification of manic or mixed states with an area under the curve (AUC)=0.89 compared with an AUC=0.78 for the classification of depressive states. Combining voice features with automatically generated objective smartphone data on behavioral activities and electronic self-monitored data increased the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of classification of affective states slightly.

The use of artificial intelligence to detect students' sentiments and emotions in gross anatomy reflections.,Rechowicz KJ; Elzie CA,"Students' reflective writings in gross anatomy provide a rich source of complex emotions experienced by learners. However, qualitative approaches to evaluating student writings are resource heavy and timely. To overcome this, natural language processing, a nascent field of artificial intelligence that uses computational techniques for the analysis and synthesis of text, was used to compare health professional students' reflections on the importance of various regions of the body to their own lives and those of the anatomical donor dissected. A total of 1365 anonymous writings (677 about a donor, 688 about self) were collected from 132 students. Binary and trinary sentiment analysis was performed, as well as emotion detection using the National Research Council Emotion Lexicon which classified text into eight emotions: anger, fear, sadness, disgust, surprise, anticipation, trust, and joy. The most commonly written about body regions were the hands, heart, and brain. The reflections had an overwhelming positive sentiment with major contributing words ""love"" and ""loved."" Predominant words such as ""pain"" contributed to the negative sentiments and reflected various ailments experienced by students and revealed through dissections of the donors. The top three emotions were trust, joy, and anticipation. Each body region evoked a unique combination of emotions. Similarities between student self-reflections and reflections about their donor were evident suggesting a shared view of humanization and person centeredness. Given the pervasiveness of reflections in anatomy, adopting a natural language processing approach to analysis could provide a rich source of new information related to students' previously undiscovered experiences and competencies.",2024,Jul-Aug,Anat Sci Educ,17,5,954-966,,10.1002/ase.2273,36931887,#5558,Rechowicz 2024,"",""
How to apply zero-shot learning to text data in substance use research: An overview and tutorial with media data.,Riordan B; Bonela AA; He Z; Nibali A; Anderson-Luxford D; Kuntsche E,"A vast amount of media-related text data is generated daily in the form of social media posts, news stories or academic articles. These text data provide opportunities for researchers to analyse and understand how substance-related issues are being discussed. The main methods to analyse large text data (content analyses or specifically trained deep-learning models) require substantial manual annotation and resources. A machine-learning approach called 'zero-shot learning' may be quicker, more flexible and require fewer resources. Zero-shot learning uses models trained on large, unlabelled (or weakly labelled) data sets to classify previously unseen data into categories on which the model has not been specifically trained. This means that a pre-existing zero-shot learning model can be used to analyse media-related text data without the need for task-specific annotation or model training. This approach may be particularly important for analysing data that is time critical. This article describes the relatively new concept of zero-shot learning and how it can be applied to text data in substance use research, including a brief practical tutorial.",2024,May,Addiction,119,5,951-959,,10.1111/add.16427,38212974,#5565,Riordan 2024,"",""
Improving Reading in Adolescents and Adults With High-Functioning Autism Through an Assistive Technology Tool: A Cross-Over Multinational Study.,Cerga-Pashoja A; Gaete J; Shishkova A; Jordanova V,"People with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience reading comprehension difficulties, often misinterpreting complex texts, metaphors, and idioms. We have developed and tested a new assistive technology tool for adaptive, personalized text simplification, called Open Book. This tool is an open-sourced, online platform that uses Natural Language Processing with the specific aim of assisting reading and aiding understanding of written text for people with ASD. The accessibility and effectiveness of Open Book was tested by examining the differences in text comprehension scores between the original texts and texts that were simplified by Open Book tool, randomly allocated to study participants. Two hundred forty-three participants (153 adults and 90 adolescents) with high-functioning ASD were recruited in the UK, Spain, and Bulgaria. Regarding the primary outcome, results showed that both adults and adolescents with ASD gave more correct answers for the simplified (M = 11.2, SD = 4.1) than original texts (M = 10, SD = 4.1; p < 0.001). This finding was consistent across age groups and countries. Regarding the secondary outcome, when participants were asked to blindly rate how easy was to understand each text, simplified texts were rated as easier (M = 7.6, SD = 2.4) to understand than the original texts (M = 8.7, SD = 2.6; p < 0.001). The Open Book software seems to have the potential to be a useful tool in assisting reading among people with ASD. Our findings support our primary hypothesis that texts simplified through Open Book were easier to comprehend compared to original texts.",2019,,Front Psychiatry,10,,546,,10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00546,31447711,#5572,Cerga-Pashoja 2019,"",""
The relationship between text message sentiment and self-reported depression.,Liu T; Meyerhoff J; Eichstaedt JC; Karr CJ; Kaiser SM; Kording KP; Mohr DC; Ungar LH,"BACKGROUND: Personal sensing has shown promise for detecting behavioral correlates of depression, but there is little work examining personal sensing of cognitive and affective states. Digital language, particularly through personal text messages, is one source that can measure these markers. METHODS: We correlated privacy-preserving sentiment analysis of text messages with self-reported depression symptom severity. We enrolled 219 U.S. adults in a 16 week longitudinal observational study. Participants installed a personal sensing app on their phones, which administered self-report PHQ-8 assessments of their depression severity, collected phone sensor data, and computed anonymized language sentiment scores from their text messages. We also trained machine learning models for predicting end-of-study self-reported depression status using on blocks of phone sensor and text features. RESULTS: In correlation analyses, we find that degrees of depression, emotional, and personal pronoun language categories correlate most strongly with self-reported depression, validating prior literature. Our classification models which predict binary depression status achieve a leave-one-out AUC of 0.72 when only considering text features and 0.76 when combining text with other networked smartphone sensors. LIMITATIONS: Participants were recruited from a panel that over-represented women, caucasians, and individuals with self-reported depression at baseline. As language use differs across demographic factors, generalizability beyond this population may be limited. The study period also coincided with the initial COVID-19 outbreak in the United States, which may have affected smartphone sensor data quality.

A clinical perspective on the relevance of research domain criteria in electronic health records.,McCoy TH; Castro VM; Rosenfield HR; Cagan A; Kohane IS; Perlis RH,"OBJECTIVE: The limitations of the DSM nosology for capturing dimensionality and overlap in psychiatric syndromes, and its poor correspondence to underlying neurobiology, have been well established. The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), a proposed dimensional model of psychopathology, may offer new insights into psychiatric illness. For psychiatric clinicians, however, because tools for capturing these domains in clinical practice have not yet been established, the relevance and means of transition from the categorical system of DSM-5 to the dimensional models of RDoC remains unclear. The authors explored a method of extracting these dimensions from existing electronic health record (EHR) notes. METHOD: The authors used information retrieval and natural language processing methods to extract estimates of the RDoC dimensions in the EHRs of a large health system. They parsed and scored EHR documentation for 2,484 admissions covering 2,010 patients admitted to a psychiatric inpatient unit between 2011 and 2013. These domain scores were compared with DSM-IV-based ICD-9 codes to assess face validity. As a measure of predictive validity, these scores were examined for association with two outcomes: length of hospital stay and time to all-cause hospital readmission. Together, these analyses were intended to address the extent to which RDoC symptom domains might capture clinical features already available in narrative notes but not reflected in DSM diagnoses. RESULTS: In mixed-effects models, loadings for the RDoC cognitive and arousal domains were associated with length of hospital stay, while the negative valence and social domains were associated with hazard of all-cause hospital readmission. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that a computationally derived tool based on RDoC workgroup reports identifies symptom distributions in clinician notes beyond those captured by ICD-9 codes, and these domains have significant predictive validity. More generally, they point to the possibility that clinicians already document RDoC-relevant symptoms, albeit not in a quantified form.",2015,Apr,Am J Psychiatry,172,4,316-20,,10.1176/appi.ajp.2014.14091177,25827030,#5577,McCoy 2015,"",""
Automated indexing of Internet stories for health behavior change: weight loss attitude pilot study.,Manuvinakurike R; Velicer WF; Bickmore TW,"BACKGROUND: Automated health behavior change interventions show promise, but suffer from high attrition and disuse. The Internet abounds with thousands of personal narrative accounts of health behavior change that could not only provide useful information and motivation for others who are also trying to change, but an endless source of novel, entertaining stories that may keep participants more engaged than messages authored by interventionists. OBJECTIVE: Given a collection of relevant personal health behavior change stories gathered from the Internet, the aim of this study was to develop and evaluate an automated indexing algorithm that could select the best possible story to provide to a user to have the greatest possible impact on their attitudes toward changing a targeted health behavior, in this case weight loss. METHODS: An indexing algorithm was developed using features informed by theories from behavioral medicine together with text classification and machine learning techniques. The algorithm was trained using a crowdsourced dataset, then evaluated in a 2×2 between-subjects randomized pilot study. One factor compared the effects of participants reading 2 indexed stories vs 2 randomly selected stories, whereas the second factor compared the medium used to tell the stories: text or animated conversational agent. Outcome measures included changes in self-efficacy and decisional balance for weight loss before and after the stories were read. RESULTS: Participants were recruited from a crowdsourcing website (N=103; 53.4%, 55/103 female; mean age 35, SD 10.8 years; 65.0%, 67/103 precontemplation; 19.4%, 20/103 contemplation for weight loss). Participants who read indexed stories exhibited a significantly greater increase in self-efficacy for weight loss compared to the control group (F1,107=5.5, P=.02). There were no significant effects of indexing on change in decisional balance (F1,97=0.05, P=.83) and no significant effects of medium on change in self-efficacy (F1,107=0.04, P=.84) or decisional balance (F1,97=0.78, P=.38). CONCLUSIONS: Personal stories of health behavior change can be harvested from the Internet and used directly and automatically in interventions to affect participant attitudes, such as self-efficacy for changing behavior. Such approaches have the potential to provide highly tailored interventions that maximize engagement and retention with minimal intervention development effort.",2014,Dec,J Med Internet Res,16,12,e285,,10.2196/jmir.3702,25491243,#5578,Manuvinakurike 2014,"",""

Automated scoring of the autobiographical interview with natural language processing.,van Genugten RDI; Schacter DL,"The autobiographical interview has been used in more than 200 studies to assess the content of autobiographical memories. In a typical experiment, participants recall memories, which are then scored manually for internal details (episodic details from the central event) and external details (largely non-episodic details). Scoring these narratives requires a significant amount of time. As a result, large studies with this procedure are often impractical, and even conducting small studies is time-consuming. To reduce scoring burden and enable larger studies, we developed an approach to automatically score responses with natural language processing. We fine-tuned an existing language model (distilBERT) to identify the amount of internal and external content in each sentence. These predictions were aggregated to obtain internal and external content estimates for each narrative. We evaluated our model by comparing manual scores with automated scores in five datasets. We found that our model performed well across datasets. In four datasets, we found a strong correlation between internal detail counts and the amount of predicted internal content. In these datasets, manual and automated external scores were also strongly correlated, and we found minimal misclassification of content. In a fifth dataset, our model performed well after additional preprocessing.

Using AI-Based Virtual Companions to Assist Adolescents with Autism in Recognizing and Addressing Cyberbullying.,Ferrer R; Ali K; Hughes C,"Social media platforms and online gaming sites play a pervasive role in facilitating peer interaction and social development for adolescents, but they also pose potential threats to health and safety. It is crucial to tackle cyberbullying issues within these platforms to ensure the healthy social development of adolescents. Cyberbullying has been linked to adverse mental health outcomes among adolescents, including anxiety, depression, academic underperformance, and an increased risk of suicide. While cyberbullying is a concern for all adolescents, those with disabilities are particularly susceptible and face a higher risk of being targets of cyberbullying. Our research addresses these challenges by introducing a personalized online virtual companion guided by artificial intelligence (AI). The web-based virtual companion's interactions aim to assist adolescents in detecting cyberbullying. More specifically, an adolescent with ASD watches a cyberbullying scenario in a virtual environment, and the AI virtual companion then asks the adolescent if he/she detected cyberbullying. To inform the virtual companion in real time to know if the adolescent has learned about detecting cyberbullying, we have implemented fast and lightweight cyberbullying detection models employing the T5-small and MobileBERT networks.

The sample included adults with symptoms of ARFID as evidenced by marked interference in psychosocial functioning, weight loss/sustained low weight, and/or nutritional deficiency (likely ARFID), and non-ARFID participants. We leveraged state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) methods to classify feeding strategies that were perceived as helpful or not helpful. The best classifiers that distinguished helpful approaches were further analyzed using qualitative coding according to a grounded theory approach. RESULTS: NLP reliably and accurately classified the perceived helpfulness of caregivers' feeding strategies (82%) and provided information about features of helpful parent strategies using recollections of adults with varying degrees of food avoidance. Strategies perceived as forceful were regarded as not helpful. Positive and encouraging strategies were perceived as helpful in improving attitudes toward food and minimizing social discomfort around eating. Although food variety improved, adults still struggled with a degree of avoidance/restriction. DISCUSSION: Adults perceived that positive parent feeding strategies were helpful even though they continued to experience some degree of food avoidance. Creating a positive emotional context surrounding food and eating with others may help to eliminate psychosocial impairment and increase food approach in those with severe food avoidance.

Identifying Military Service Status in Electronic Healthcare Records from Psychiatric Secondary Healthcare Services: A Validation Exercise Using the Military Service Identification Tool.,Leightley D; Palmer L; Williamson C; Leal R; Chandran D; Murphy D; Fear NT; Stevelink SAM,"Electronic healthcare records (EHRs) are a rich source of information with a range of uses in secondary research. In the United Kingdom, there is no pan-national or nationally accepted marker indicating veteran status across all healthcare services. This presents significant obstacles to determining the healthcare needs of veterans using EHRs. To address this issue, we developed the Military Service Identification Tool (MSIT), using an iterative two-staged approach. In the first stage, a Structured Query Language approach was developed to identify veterans using a keyword rule-based approach. This informed the second stage, which was the development of the MSIT using machine learning, which, when tested, obtained an accuracy of 0.97, a positive predictive value of 0.90, a sensitivity of 0.91, and a negative predictive value of 0.98.

Mental Health Severity Detection from Psychological Forum Data using Domain-Specific Unlabelled Data.,Patra BG; Kar R; Roberts K; Wu H,"Mental health has become a growing concern in the medical field, yet remains difficult to study due to both privacy concerns and the lack of objectively quantifiable measurements (e.g., lab tests, physical exams). Instead, the data that is available for mental health is largely based on subjective accounts of a patient's experience, and thus typically is expressed exclusively in text.

Investigating the Use of Electronic Well-being Diaries Completed Within a Psychoeducation Program for University Students: Longitudinal Text Analysis Study.,Linton MA; Jelbert S; Kidger J; Morris R; Biddle L; Hood B,"BACKGROUND: Psychoeducation has the potential to support students experiencing distress and help meet the demand for support; however, there is a need to understand how these programs are experienced. Web-based diaries are a useful activity for psychoeducation because of their therapeutic benefits, ability to capture naturalistic data relevant to well-being, and appropriateness for text analysis methods. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine how university students use electronic diaries within a psychoeducation program designed to enhance mental well-being. METHODS: The Science of Happiness course was administered to 154 undergraduate students in a university setting (the United Kingdom). Diaries were collected from the students for 9 weeks. Baseline well-being data were collected using the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (SWEMWBS). The percentage of negative and positive emotion words used in diaries (emotional tone) and use of words from five life domains (social, work, money, health, and leisure) were calculated using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count 2015 software. Random effects (generalized least squares) regression models were estimated to examine whether time, diary characteristics, demographics, and baseline well-being predict the emotional tone of diaries. RESULTS: A total of 149 students participated in the diary study, producing 1124 individual diary entries. Compliance with the diary task peaked in week 1 (n=1041, 92.62%) and was at its lowest in week 3 (n=807, 71.81%). Compared with week 1, diaries were significantly more positive in their emotional tone during week 5 (mean difference 23.90, 95% CI 16.89-30.90) and week 6 (mean difference 26.62, 95% CI 19.35-33.88) when students were tasked with writing about gratitude and their strengths. Across weeks, moderate and high baseline SWEMWBS scores were associated with a higher percentage of positive emotion words used in diaries (increases compared with students scoring low in SWEMWBS were 5.03, 95% CI 0.08-9.98 and 7.48, 95% CI 1.84-13.12, respectively). At week 1, the diaries of students with the highest levels of baseline well-being (82.92, 95% CI 73.08-92.76) were more emotionally positive on average than the diaries of students with the lowest levels of baseline well-being (59.38, 95% CI 51.02-67.73). Diaries largely focused on the use of social words. The emotional tone of diary entries was positively related to the use of leisure (3.56, 95% CI 2.28-4.85) and social words (0.74, 95% CI 0.21-1.27), and inversely related to the use of health words (-1.96, 95% CI -3.70 to -0.22). CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence for short-term task-specific spikes in the emotional positivity of web-based diary entries and recommend future studies examine the possibility of long-term impacts on the writing and well-being of students. With student well-being strategies in mind, universities should value and encourage leisure and social activities.",2021,Apr,J Med Internet Res,23,4,e25279,,10.2196/25279,33885373,#5644,Linton 2021,"",""
Early temporal characteristics of elderly patient cognitive impairment in electronic health records.,Goudarzvand S; St Sauver J; Mielke MM; Takahashi PY; Lee Y; Sohn S,"BACKGROUND: The aging population has led to an increase in cognitive impairment (CI) resulting in significant costs to patients, their families, and society. A research endeavor on a large cohort to better understand the frequency and severity of CI is urgent to respond to the health needs of this population. However, little is known about temporal trends of patient health functions (i.e., activity of daily living [ADL]) and how these trends are associated with the onset of CI in elderly patients. Also, the use of a rich source of clinical free text in electronic health records (EHRs) to facilitate CI research has not been well explored. The aim of this study is to characterize and better understand early signals of elderly patient CI by examining temporal trends of patient ADL and analyzing topics of patient medical conditions in clinical free text using topic models. METHODS: The study cohort consists of physician-diagnosed CI patients (n = 1,435) and cognitively unimpaired (CU) patients (n = 1,435) matched by age and sex, selected from patients 65 years of age or older at the time of enrollment in the Mayo Clinic Biobank. A corpus analysis was performed to examine the basic statistics of event types and practice settings where the physician first diagnosed CI. We analyzed the distribution of ADL in three different age groups over time before the development of CI. Furthermore, we applied three different topic modeling approaches on clinical free text to examine how patients' medical conditions change over time when they were close to CI diagnosis. RESULTS: The trajectories of ADL deterioration became steeper in CI patients than CU patients approximately 1 to 1.5 year(s) before the actual physician diagnosis of CI. The topic modeling showed that the topic terms were mostly correlated and captured the underlying semantics relevant to CI when approaching to CI diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: There exist notable differences in temporal trends of basic and instrumental ADL between CI and CU patients. The trajectories of certain individual ADL, such as bathing and responsibility of own medication, were closely associated with CI development.

Understanding Therapeutic Change Process Research Through Multilevel Modeling and Text Mining.,Smink WAC; Fox JP; Tjong Kim Sang E; Sools AM; Westerhof GJ; Veldkamp BP,"Online interventions hold great potential for Therapeutic Change Process Research (TCPR), a field that aims to relate in-therapeutic change processes to the outcomes of interventions. Online a client is treated essentially through the language their counsellor uses, therefore the verbal interaction contains many important ingredients that bring about change. TCPR faces two challenges: how to derive meaningful change processes from texts, and secondly, how to assess these complex, varied, and multi-layered processes? We advocate the use text mining and multi-level models (MLMs): the former offers tools and methods to discovers patterns in texts; the latter can analyse these change processes as outcomes that vary at multiple levels. We (re-)used the data from Lamers et al. (2015) because it includes outcomes and the complete online intervention for clients with mild depressive symptoms. We used text mining to obtain basic text-variables from e-mails, that we analyzed through MLMs. We found that we could relate outcomes of interventions to variables containing text-information. We conclude that we can indeed bridge text mining and MLMs for TCPR as it was possible to relate text-information (obtained through text mining) to multi-leveled TCPR outcomes (using a MLM). Text mining can be helpful to obtain change processes, which is also the main challenge for TCPR. We showed how MLMs and text mining can be combined, but our proposition leaves open how to obtain the most relevant textual operationalization of TCPR concepts. That requires interdisciplinary collaboration and discussion. The future does look bright: based on our proof-of-concept study we conclude that MLMs and text mining can indeed advance TCPR.",2019,,Front Psychol,10,,1186,,10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01186,31191394,#5651,SminkWAC 2019,"",""

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze positive or negative sentiments through inspection of the free text of the ENCN, compare sentiments of ENCN with or without hospitalized patients with COVID-19, carry out temporal analysis of the sentiments of the patients during the start of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, and identify the topics in ENCN. METHODS: This is a descriptive study with analysis of the text content of ENCN. All ENCNs between January and June 2020 at Guadarrama Hospital (Madrid, Spain) extracted from the CGM Selene Electronic Health Records System were included. Two groups of ENCNs were analyzed: one from hospitalized patients in post-intensive care units for COVID-19 and a second group from hospitalized patients without COVID-19. A sentiment analysis was performed on the lemmatized text, using the National Research Council of Canada, Affin, and Bing dictionaries. A polarity analysis of the sentences was performed using the Bing dictionary, SO Dictionaries V1.11, and Spa dictionary as amplifiers and decrementators. Machine learning techniques were applied to evaluate the presence of significant differences in the ENCN in groups of patients with and those without COVID-19. Finally, a structural analysis of thematic models was performed to study the abstract topics that occur in the ENCN, using Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling. RESULTS: A total of 37,564 electronic health records were analyzed. Sentiment analysis in ENCN showed that patients with subacute COVID-19 have a higher proportion of positive sentiments than those without COVID-19. Also, there are significant differences in polarity between both groups (Z=5.532, P<.001) with a polarity of 0.108 (SD 0.299) in patients with COVID-19 versus that of 0.09 (SD 0.301) in those without COVID-19. Machine learning modeling reported that despite all models presenting high values, it is the neural network that presents the best indicators (>0.8) and with significant P values between both groups. Through Structural Topic Modeling analysis, the final model containing 10 topics was selected. High correlations were noted among topics 2, 5, and 8 (pressure ulcer and pharmacotherapy treatment), topics 1, 4, 7, and 9 (incidences related to fever and well-being state, and baseline oxygen saturation) and topics 3 and 10 (blood glucose level and pain). CONCLUSIONS: The ENCN may help in the development and implementation of more effective programs, which allows patients with COVID-19 to adopt to their prepandemic lifestyle faster. Topic modeling could help identify specific clinical problems in patients and better target the care they receive.",2022,May,JMIR Med Inform,10,5,e38308,,10.2196/38308,35486902,#5661,Cuenca-Zaldívar 2022,"",""
Development of a phenotype ontology for autism spectrum disorder by natural language processing on electronic health records.,Zhao M; Havrilla J; Peng J; Drye M; Fecher M; Guthrie W; Tunc B; Schultz R; Wang K; Zhou Y,"BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition characterized by restricted, repetitive behavior, and impaired social communication and interactions. However, significant challenges remain in diagnosing and subtyping ASD due in part to the lack of a validated, standardized vocabulary to characterize clinical phenotypic presentation of ASD. Although the human phenotype ontology (HPO) plays an important role in delineating nuanced phenotypes for rare genetic diseases, it is inadequate to capture characteristic of behavioral and psychiatric phenotypes for individuals with ASD. There is a clear need, therefore, for a well-established phenotype terminology set that can assist in characterization of ASD phenotypes from patients' clinical narratives. METHODS: To address this challenge, we used natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify and curate ASD phenotypic terms from high-quality unstructured clinical notes in the electronic health record (EHR) on 8499 individuals with ASD, 8177 individuals with non-ASD psychiatric disorders, and 8482 individuals without a documented psychiatric disorder. We further performed dimensional reduction clustering analysis to subgroup individuals with ASD, using nonnegative matrix factorization method. RESULTS: Through a note-processing pipeline that includes several steps of state-of-the-art NLP approaches, we identified 3336 ASD terms linking to 1943 unique medical concepts, which represents among the largest ASD terminology set to date. The extracted ASD terms were further organized in a formal ontology structure similar to the HPO. Clustering analysis showed that these terms could be used in a diagnostic pipeline to differentiate individuals with ASD from individuals with other psychiatric disorders. CONCLUSION: Our ASD phenotype ontology can assist clinicians and researchers in characterizing individuals with ASD, facilitating automated diagnosis, and subtyping individuals with ASD to facilitate personalized therapeutic decision-making.",2022,May,J Neurodev Disord,14,1,32,,10.1186/s11689-022-09442-0,35606697,#5669,Zhao 2022,"",""
Toward mapping pragmatic impairment of autism spectrum disorder individuals through the development of a corpus of spoken Japanese.,Kato S; Hanawa K; Linh VP; Saito M; Iimura R; Inui K; Nakamura K,"The central symptom of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is deficiency in social communication, which is generally viewed as being caused by pragmatic impairment (PI). PI is difficulty in using language appropriately in social situations. Studies have confirmed that PI is the result of neurological, cognitive, linguistic, and sensorimotor dysfunctions involving intricately intertwined factors. To elucidate the whole picture of this impairment, an approach from a multifaceted perspective fusing those factors is necessary. To this end, comprehensive PI mapping is a must, since no comprehensive mapping has yet been developed. The aim of this research is to present a model of annotation scheme development and corpus construction to efficiently visualize and quantify for statistical investigation occurrences of PI, which enables comprehensive mapping of PI in the spoken language of Japanese ASD individuals. We constructed system networks (lexicogrammatical option systems speakers make choices from) in the theoretical framework of Systemic Functional Linguistics, from which we developed an annotation scheme to comprehensively cover PI. Since system network covers all possible lexicogrammatical choices in linguistic interaction, it enables a comprehensive view of where and in what lexicogrammar PI occurs. Based on this annotation scheme, we successfully developed the Corpus of ASD + Typically Developed Spoken Language consisting of texts from 1,187 audiotaped tasks performed by 186 ASD and 106 typically developed subjects, accommodating approximately 1.07 million morphemes. Moreover, we were successful in the automatization of the annotation process by machine learning, accomplishing a 90 percent precision rate. We exemplified the mapping procedure with a focus on the spoken use of negotiating particles. Our model corpus is applicable to any language by incorporating our method of constructing the annotation scheme, and would give impetus to defining PI from a cross-linguistic point of view, which is needed because PI of ASD reflects cross-linguistic differences.",2022,,PLoS One,17,2,e0264204,,10.1371/journal.pone.0264204,35213580,#5684,Kato 2022,"",""
Clinical decision support for bipolar depression using large language models.,Perlis RH; Goldberg JF; Ostacher MJ; Schneck CD,"Management of depressive episodes in bipolar disorder remains challenging for clinicians despite the availability of treatment guidelines. In other contexts, large language models have yielded promising results for supporting clinical decisionmaking. We developed 50 sets of clinical vignettes reflecting bipolar depression and presented them to experts in bipolar disorder, who were asked to identify 5 optimal next-step pharmacotherapies and 5 poor or contraindicated choices. The same vignettes were then presented to a large language model (GPT4-turbo; gpt-4-1106-preview), with or without augmentation by prompting with recent bipolar treatment guidelines, and asked to identify the optimal next-step pharmacotherapy. Overlap between model output and gold standard was estimated. The augmented model prioritized the expert-designated optimal choice for 508/1000 vignettes (50.8%, 95% CI 47.7-53.9%; Cohen's kappa = 0.31, 95% CI 0.28-0.35). For 120 vignettes (12.0%), at least one model choice was among the poor or contraindicated treatments. Results were not meaningfully different when gender or race of the vignette was permuted to examine risk for bias. By comparison, an un-augmented model identified the optimal treatment for 234 (23.0%, 95% CI 20.8-26.0%; McNemar's p < 0.001 versus augmented model) of the vignettes. A sample of community clinicians scoring the same vignettes identified the optimal choice for 23.1% (95% CI 15.7-30.5%) of vignettes, on average; McNemar's p < 0.001 versus augmented model. Large language models prompted with evidence-based guidelines represent a promising, scalable strategy for clinical decision support.

Exploring Eating Disorder Topics on Twitter: Machine Learning Approach.,Zhou S; Zhao Y; Bian J; Haynos AF; Zhang R,"BACKGROUND: Eating disorders (EDs) are a group of mental illnesses that have an adverse effect on both mental and physical health. As social media platforms (eg, Twitter) have become an important data source for public health research, some studies have qualitatively explored the ways in which EDs are discussed on these platforms. Initial results suggest that such research offers a promising method for further understanding this group of diseases. Nevertheless, an efficient computational method is needed to further identify and analyze tweets relevant to EDs on a larger scale. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop and validate a machine learning-based classifier to identify tweets related to EDs and to explore factors (ie, topics) related to EDs using a topic modeling method. METHODS: We collected potential ED-relevant tweets using keywords from previous studies and annotated these tweets into different groups (ie, ED relevant vs irrelevant and then promotional information vs laypeople discussion). Several supervised machine learning methods, such as convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), support vector machine, and naïve Bayes, were developed and evaluated using annotated data. We used the classifier with the best performance to identify ED-relevant tweets and applied a topic modeling method-Correlation Explanation (CorEx)-to analyze the content of the identified tweets. To validate these machine learning results, we also collected a cohort of ED-relevant tweets on the basis of manually curated rules. RESULTS: A total of 123,977 tweets were collected during the set period. We randomly annotated 2219 tweets for developing the machine learning classifiers. We developed a CNN-LSTM classifier to identify ED-relevant tweets published by laypeople in 2 steps: first relevant versus irrelevant (F(1) score=0.89) and then promotional versus published by laypeople (F(1) score=0.90). A total of 40,790 ED-relevant tweets were identified using the CNN-LSTM classifier. We also identified another set of tweets (ie, 17,632 ED-relevant and 83,557 ED-irrelevant tweets) posted by laypeople using manually specified rules. Using CorEx on all ED-relevant tweets, the topic model identified 162 topics. Overall, the coherence rate for topic modeling was 77.07% (1264/1640), indicating a high quality of the produced topics. The topics were further reviewed and analyzed by a domain expert. CONCLUSIONS: A developed CNN-LSTM classifier could improve the efficiency of identifying ED-relevant tweets compared with the traditional manual-based method. The CorEx topic model was applied on the tweets identified by the machine learning-based classifier and the traditional manual approach separately. Highly overlapping topics were observed between the 2 cohorts of tweets. The produced topics were further reviewed by a domain expert. Some of the topics identified by the potential ED tweets may provide new avenues for understanding this serious set of disorders.",2020,Oct,JMIR Med Inform,8,10,e18273,,10.2196/18273,33124997,#5704,Zhou 2020,"",""
Differential temporal utility of passively sensed smartphone features for depression and anxiety symptom prediction: a longitudinal cohort study.,Stamatis CA; Meyerhoff J; Meng Y; Lin ZCC; Cho YM; Liu T; Karr CJ; Curtis BL; Ungar LH; Mohr DC,"While studies show links between smartphone data and affective symptoms, we lack clarity on the temporal scale, specificity (e.g., to depression vs. anxiety), and person-specific (vs. group-level) nature of these associations. We conducted a large-scale (n = 1013) smartphone-based passive sensing study to identify within- and between-person digital markers of depression and anxiety symptoms over time. Participants (74.6% female; M age = 40.9) downloaded the LifeSense app, which facilitated continuous passive data collection (e.g., GPS, app and device use, communication) across 16 weeks. Hierarchical linear regression models tested the within- and between-person associations of 2-week windows of passively sensed data with depression (PHQ-8) or generalized anxiety (GAD-7). We used a shifting window to understand the time scale at which sensed features relate to mental health symptoms, predicting symptoms 2 weeks in the future (distal prediction), 1 week in the future (medial prediction), and 0 weeks in the future (proximal prediction). Spending more time at home relative to one's average was an early signal of PHQ-8 severity (distal β = 0.219, p = 0.012) and continued to relate to PHQ-8 at medial (β = 0.198, p = 0.022) and proximal (β = 0.183, p = 0.045) windows. In contrast, circadian movement was proximally related to (β = -0.131, p = 0.035) but did not predict (distal β = 0.034, p = 0.577; medial β = -0.089, p = 0.138) PHQ-8. Distinct communication features (i.e., call/text or app-based messaging) related to PHQ-8 and GAD-7. Findings have implications for identifying novel treatment targets, personalizing digital mental health interventions, and enhancing traditional patient-provider interactions. Certain features (e.g., circadian movement) may represent correlates but not true prospective indicators of affective symptoms.

A CNN-Based Framework for Predicting Public Emotion and Multi-Level Behaviors Based on Network Public Opinion.,Lin H; Bu N,"Analysis of network public opinion can help to effectively predict the public emotion and the multi-level government behaviors. Due to the massive and multidimensional characteristics of network public opinion data, the in-depth value mining of public opinion is one of the research bottlenecks. Based on Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and deep learning technologies, this paper proposes an advanced TF-IDF mechanism, namely TF-IDF-COR, to extract text feature representations of public opinions and develops a CNN-based prediction model to predict the tendency of publics' emotion and mental health. The proposed method can accurately judge the emotional tendency of network users. The main contribution of this paper is as follows: (1) based on the advantages of TF-IDF mechanism, we propose a TF-IDF-COR mechanism, which integrates the correlation coefficient of word embeddings to TF-IDF. (2) To make the extracted feature semantic information more comprehensive, CNN and TF-IDF-COR are combined to form an effective COR-CNN model for emotion and mental health prediction. Finally, experiments on Sina-Weibo and Twitter opinion data sets show that the improved TF-IDF-COR and the COR-CNN model have better classification performance than traditional classification models. In the experiment, we compare the proposed COR-CNN with support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors, and convolutional neural network in terms of accuracy and F1 score. Experiment results show that COR-CNN performs much better than the three baseline models.",2022,,Front Psychol,13,,909439,,10.3389/fpsyg.2022.909439,35814112,#5722,Lin 2022,"",""
Supervised latent Dirichlet allocation with covariates: A Bayesian structural and measurement model of text and covariates.,Wilcox KT; Jacobucci R; Zhang Z; Ammerman BA,"Text is a burgeoning data source for psychological researchers, but little methodological research has focused on adapting popular modeling approaches for text to the context of psychological research. One popular measurement model for text, topic modeling, uses a latent mixture model to represent topics underlying a body of documents. Recently, psychologists have studied relationships between these topics and other psychological measures by using estimates of the topics as regression predictors along with other manifest variables. While similar two-stage approaches involving estimated latent variables are known to yield biased estimates and incorrect standard errors, two-stage topic modeling approaches have received limited statistical study and, as we show, are subject to the same problems. To address these problems, we proposed a novel statistical model-supervised latent Dirichlet allocation with covariates (SLDAX)-that jointly incorporates a latent variable measurement model of text and a structural regression model to allow the latent topics and other manifest variables to serve as predictors of an outcome. Using a simulation study with data characteristics consistent with psychological text data, we found that SLDAX estimates were generally more accurate and more efficient. To illustrate the application of SLDAX and a two-stage approach, we provide an empirical clinical application to compare the application of both the two-stage and SLDAX approaches. Finally, we implemented the SLDAX model in an open-source R package to facilitate its use and further study.

Research on Mental Health Monitoring Scheme of Migrant Children Based on Convolutional Neural Network Based on Deep Learning.,Yang G,"In recent years, with the acceleration of urbanization and the implementation of compulsory education, the pressure on students' study and life has increased, and the phenomenon of psychological and behavioral problems has become increasingly prominent. Therefore, the school has regarded students' mental health education as the top priority in teaching work. Effective expression classification can assist psychology researchers to study psychology and other disciplines and analyze children's psychological activities and mental states by classifying expressions, thereby reducing the occurrence of psychological behavior problems. Most of the current mainstream methods focus on the exploration of text explicit features and the optimization of representation models, and few works pay attention to deeper language expressions. Metaphors, as language expressions often used in daily life, are closely related to an individual's emotion, cognition, and psychological state. This paper studies children's smiling face recognition based on deep neural network. In order to obtain a better identification effect of mental health problems of children, this paper attempts to use multisource data, including consumption data, access control data, network logs, and grade data, and proposes a multisource data-based mental health problem identification algorithm.

Deep Learning-Based Methods for Sentiment Analysis on Nepali COVID-19-Related Tweets.,Sitaula C; Basnet A; Mainali A; Shahi TB,"COVID-19 has claimed several human lives to this date. People are dying not only because of physical infection of the virus but also because of mental illness, which is linked to people's sentiments and psychologies.

Detecting Recovery Problems Just in Time: Application of Automated Linguistic Analysis and Supervised Machine Learning to an Online Substance Abuse Forum.,Kornfield R; Sarma PK; Shah DV; McTavish F; Landucci G; Pe-Romashko K; Gustafson DH,"BACKGROUND: Online discussion forums allow those in addiction recovery to seek help through text-based messages, including when facing triggers to drink or use drugs. Trained staff (or ""moderators"") may participate within these forums to offer guidance and support when participants are struggling but must expend considerable effort to continually review new content. Demands on moderators limit the scalability of evidence-based digital health interventions. OBJECTIVE: Automated identification of recovery problems could allow moderators to engage in more timely and efficient ways with participants who are struggling. This paper aimed to investigate whether computational linguistics and supervised machine learning can be applied to successfully flag, in real time, those discussion forum messages that moderators find most concerning. METHODS: Training data came from a trial of a mobile phone-based health intervention for individuals in recovery from alcohol use disorder, with human coders labeling discussion forum messages according to whether or not authors mentioned problems in their recovery process. Linguistic features of these messages were extracted via several computational techniques: (1) a Bag-of-Words approach, (2) the dictionary-based Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count program, and (3) a hybrid approach combining the most important features from both Bag-of-Words and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count. These features were applied within binary classifiers leveraging several methods of supervised machine learning: support vector machines, decision trees, and boosted decision trees. Classifiers were evaluated in data from a later deployment of the recovery support intervention. RESULTS: To distinguish recovery problem disclosures, the Bag-of-Words approach relied on domain-specific language, including words explicitly linked to substance use and mental health (""drink,"" ""relapse,"" ""depression,"" and so on), whereas the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count approach relied on language characteristics such as tone, affect, insight, and presence of quantifiers and time references, as well as pronouns. A boosted decision tree classifier, utilizing features from both Bag-of-Words and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count performed best in identifying problems disclosed within the discussion forum, achieving 88% sensitivity and 82% specificity in a separate cohort of patients in recovery.

Identifying encephalopathy in patients admitted to an intensive care unit: Going beyond structured information using natural language processing.,Ariño H; Bae SK; Chaturvedi J; Wang T; Roberts A,"BACKGROUND: Encephalopathy is a severe co-morbid condition in critically ill patients that includes different clinical constellation of neurological symptoms. However, even for the most recognised form, delirium, this medical condition is rarely recorded in structured fields of electronic health records precluding large and unbiased retrospective studies. We aimed to identify patients with encephalopathy using a machine learning-based approach over clinical notes in electronic health records. METHODS: We used a list of ICD-9 codes and clinical concepts related to encephalopathy to define a cohort of patients from the MIMIC-III dataset. Clinical notes were annotated with MedCAT and vectorized with a bag-of-word approach or word embedding using clinical concepts normalised to standard nomenclatures as features. Machine learning algorithms (support vector machines and random forest) trained with clinical notes from patients who had a diagnosis of encephalopathy (defined by ICD-9 codes) were used to classify patients with clinical concepts related to encephalopathy in their clinical notes but without any ICD-9 relevant code. A random selection of 50 patients were reviewed by a clinical expert for model validation. RESULTS: Among 46,520 different patients, 7.5% had encephalopathy related ICD-9 codes in all their admissions (group 1, definite encephalopathy), 45% clinical concepts related to encephalopathy only in their clinical notes (group 2, possible encephalopathy) and 38% did not have encephalopathy related concepts neither in structured nor in clinical notes (group 3, non-encephalopathy). Length of stay, mortality rate or number of co-morbid conditions were higher in groups 1 and 2 compared to group 3.

METHODS: Trauma-exposed participants were presented with neutral and mutilation pictures during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) collection. Before the presentation of pictures, a text informed the subjects that the pictures were fictitious (""safe context"") or real-life scenes (""real context""). We trained machine learning regression models (Gaussian process regression (GPR)) to predict PTSD symptoms in real and safe contexts. RESULTS: The GPR model could predict PTSD symptoms from brain responses to mutilation pictures in the real context but not in the safe context. The brain regions with the highest contribution to the model were the occipito-parietal regions, including the superior parietal gyrus, inferior parietal gyrus, and supramarginal gyrus. Additional analysis showed that GPR regression models accurately predicted clusters of PTSD symptoms, nominal intrusion, avoidance, and alterations in cognition. As expected, we obtained very similar results as those obtained in a model predicting PTSD total symptoms. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to show that machine learning applied to fMRI data collected in an aversive context can predict not only PTSD total symptoms but also clusters of PTSD symptoms in a more aversive context. Furthermore, this approach was able to identify potential biomarkers for PTSD, especially in occipitoparietal regions.",2023,Oct,BMC Psychiatry,23,1,719,,10.1186/s12888-023-05220-x,37798693,#5795,PortugalLCL 2023,"",""
Determinants of Smoking and Quitting in HIV-Infected Individuals.,Regan S; Meigs JB; Grinspoon SK; Triant VA,"BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking is widespread among HIV-infected patients, who confront increased risk of smoking-related co-morbidities. The effects of HIV infection and HIV-related variables on smoking and smoking cessation are incompletely understood. We investigated the correlates of smoking and quitting in an HIV-infected cohort using a validated natural language processor to determine smoking status. METHOD: We developed and validated an algorithm using natural language processing (NLP) to ascertain smoking status from electronic health record data. The algorithm was applied to records for a cohort of 3487 HIV-infected from a large health care system in Boston, USA, and 9446 uninfected control patients matched 3:1 on age, gender, race and clinical encounters. NLP was used to identify and classify smoking-related portions of free-text notes. These classifications were combined into patient-year smoking status and used to classify patients as ever versus never smokers and current smokers versus non-smokers. Generalized linear models were used to assess associations of HIV with 3 outcomes, ever smoking, current smoking, and current smoking in analyses limited to ever smokers (persistent smoking), while adjusting for demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, and psychiatric illness. Analyses were repeated within the HIV cohort, with the addition of CD4 cell count and HIV viral load to assess associations of these HIV-related factors with the smoking outcomes. RESULTS: Using the natural language processing algorithm to assign annual smoking status yielded sensitivity of 92.4, specificity of 86.2, and AUC of 0.89 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.88-0.91). Ever and current smoking were more common in HIV-infected patients than controls (54% vs. 44% and 42% vs. 30%, respectively, both P<0.001). In multivariate models HIV was independently associated with ever smoking (adjusted rate ratio [ARR] 1.18, 95% CI 1.13-1.24, P <0.001), current smoking (ARR 1.33, 95% CI 1.25-1.40, P<0.001), and persistent smoking (ARR 1.11, 95% CI 1.07-1.15, P<0.001). Within the HIV cohort, having a detectable HIV RNA was significantly associated with all three smoking outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: HIV was independently associated with both smoking and not quitting smoking, using a novel algorithm to ascertain smoking status from electronic health record data and accounting for multiple confounding clinical factors.

A Privacy-Preserving Unsupervised Speaker Disentanglement Method for Depression Detection from Speech.,Ravi V; Wang J; Flint J; Alwan A,"The proposed method focuses on speaker disentanglement in the context of depression detection from speech signals. Previous approaches require patient/speaker labels, encounter instability due to loss maximization, and introduce unnecessary parameters for adversarial domain prediction. In contrast, the proposed unsupervised approach reduces cosine similarity between latent spaces of depression and pre-trained speaker classification models. This method outperforms baseline models, matches or exceeds adversarial methods in performance, and does so without relying on speaker labels or introducing additional model parameters, leading to a reduction in model complexity. The higher the speaker de-identification score (DeID), the better the depression detection system is in masking a patient's identity thereby enhancing the privacy attributes of depression detection systems. On the DAIC-WOZ dataset with ComparE16 features and an LSTM-only model, our method achieves an F1-Score of 0.776 and a DeID score of 92.87%, outperforming its adversarial counterpart which has an F1Score of 0.762 and 68.37% DeID, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that speaker-disentanglement methods are complementary to text-based approaches, and a score-level fusion with a Word2vec-based depression detection model further enhances the overall performance to an F1-Score of 0.830.",2024,Feb,CEUR Workshop Proc,3649,,57-63,,,38650610,#5798,Ravi 2024,"",""
Key factors predicting problem-based learning in online environments: Evidence from multimodal learning analytics.,Wang X; Sun D; Cheng G; Luo H,"Problem-based learning (PBL) has been used in different domains, and there is overwhelming evidence of its value. As an emerging field with excellent prospects, learning analytics (LA)-especially multimodal learning analytics (MMLA)-has increasingly attracted the attention of researchers in PBL. However, current research on the integration of LA with PBL has not related LA results with specific PBL steps or paid enough attention to the interaction in peer learning, especially for text data generated from peer interaction. This study employed MMLA based on machine learning (ML) to quantify the process engagement of peer learning, identify log behaviors, self-regulation, and other factors, and then predict online PBL performance. Participants were 104 fourth-year students in an online course on social work and problem-solving. The MMLA model contained multimodal data from online discussions, log files, reports, and questionnaires. ML classification models were built to classify text data in online discussions. The results showed that self-regulation, messages post, message words, and peer learning engagement in representation, solution, and evaluation were predictive of online PBL performance. Hierarchical linear regression analyses indicated stronger predictive validity of the process indicators on online PBL performance than other indicators.

The studies reported here are, as far as is known, the first attempts to study treatment notes systematically using such procedures. Linguistic measures are used to track the trajectory of the clinical process throughout the treatment in two contrasting cases, one rated successful, the other not. The computerized linguistic analysis used here focuses on two analytically relevant linguistic variables: Mean High Referential Activity (MHW), a measure of the degree to which language is connected to emotional processing, and Reflection (REF), the use of words referring to logical functions. Changes in the relative position of these measures indicate nodal points in the treatment that might be analytically or therapeutically problematic, and that might be overlooked in a solely clinical reading. The analyst's activity as reported in notes during such nodal periods is clinically examined to see how it may have affected the course of the analysis.

Automated quality assessment of cognitive behavioral therapy sessions through highly contextualized language representations.,Flemotomos N; Martinez VR; Chen Z; Creed TA; Atkins DC; Narayanan S,"During a psychotherapy session, the counselor typically adopts techniques which are codified along specific dimensions (e.g., 'displays warmth and confidence', or 'attempts to set up collaboration') to facilitate the evaluation of the session. Those constructs, traditionally scored by trained human raters, reflect the complex nature of psychotherapy and highly depend on the context of the interaction. Recent advances in deep contextualized language models offer an avenue for accurate in-domain linguistic representations which can lead to robust recognition and scoring of such psychotherapy-relevant behavioral constructs, and support quality assurance and supervision. In this work, we propose a BERT-based model for automatic behavioral scoring of a specific type of psychotherapy, called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), where prior work is limited to frequency-based language features and/or short text excerpts which do not capture the unique elements involved in a spontaneous long conversational interaction. The model focuses on the classification of therapy sessions with respect to the overall score achieved on the widely-used Cognitive Therapy Rating Scale (CTRS), but is trained in a multi-task manner in order to achieve higher interpretability. BERT-based representations are further augmented with available therapy metadata, providing relevant non-linguistic context and leading to consistent performance improvements. We train and evaluate our models on a set of 1,118 real-world therapy sessions, recorded and automatically transcribed.

Identifying Complex Emotions in Alexithymia Affected Adolescents Using Machine Learning Techniques.,ArulDass SD; Jayagopal P,"Many scientific researchers' study focuses on enhancing automated systems to identify emotions and thus relies on brain signals. This study focuses on how brain wave signals can be used to classify many emotional states of humans.

The proposed work aims to implement a methodology to identify and codify discrete complex emotions such as pleasure and grief in a rare psychological disorder known as alexithymia. This type of disorder is highly elicited in unstable, fragile countries such as South Sudan, Lebanon, and Mauritius. These countries are continuously affected by civil wars and disaster and politically unstable, leading to a very poor economy and education system. This study focuses on an adolescent age group dataset by recording physiological data when emotion is exhibited in a multimodal virtual environment. We decocted time frequency analysis and amplitude time series correlates including frontal alpha symmetry using a complex Morlet wavelet. For data visualization, we used the UMAP technique to obtain a clear district view of emotions. We performed 5-fold cross validation along with 1 s window subjective classification on the dataset.

Two data-driven approaches to identifying the spectrum of problematic opioid use: A pilot study within a chronic pain cohort.,Schirle L; Jeffery A; Yaqoob A; Sanchez-Roige S; Samuels DC,"BACKGROUND: Although electronic health records (EHR) have significant potential for the study of opioid use disorders (OUD), detecting OUD in clinical data is challenging. Models using EHR data to predict OUD often rely on case/control classifications focused on extreme opioid use. There is a need to expand this work to characterize the spectrum of problematic opioid use. METHODS: Using a large academic medical center database, we developed 2 data-driven methods of OUD detection: (1) a Comorbidity Score developed from a Phenome-Wide Association Study of phenotypes associated with OUD and (2) a Text-based Score using natural language processing to identify OUD-related concepts in clinical notes. We evaluated the performance of both scores against a manual review with correlation coefficients, Wilcoxon rank sum tests, and area-under the receiver operating characteristic curves. Records with the highest Comorbidity and Text-based scores were re-evaluated by manual review to explore discrepancies. RESULTS: Both the Comorbidity and Text-based OUD risk scores were significantly elevated in the patients judged as High Evidence for OUD in the manual review compared to those with No Evidence (p = 1.3E-5 and 1.3E-6, respectively). The risk scores were positively correlated with each other (rho = 0.52, p < 0.001). AUCs for the Comorbidity and Text-based scores were high (0.79 and 0.76, respectively). Follow-up manual review of discrepant findings revealed strengths of data-driven methods over manual review, and opportunities for improvement in risk assessment.

Development and Evaluation of ClientBot: Patient-Like Conversational Agent to Train Basic Counseling Skills.,Tanana MJ; Soma CS; Srikumar V; Atkins DC; Imel ZE,"BACKGROUND: Training therapists is both expensive and time-consuming. Degree-based training can require tens of thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours of expert instruction. Counseling skills practice often involves role-plays, standardized patients, or practice with real clients. Performance-based feedback is critical for skill development and expertise, but trainee therapists often receive minimal and subjective feedback, which is distal to their skill practice. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we developed and evaluated a patient-like neural conversational agent, which provides real-time feedback to trainees via chat-based interaction. METHODS: The text-based conversational agent was trained on an archive of 2354 psychotherapy transcripts and provided specific feedback on the use of basic interviewing and counseling skills (ie, open questions and reflections-summary statements of what a client has said). A total of 151 nontherapists were randomized to either (1) immediate feedback on their use of open questions and reflections during practice session with ClientBot or (2) initial education and encouragement on the skills. RESULTS: Participants in the ClientBot condition used 91% (21.4/11.2) more reflections during practice with feedback (P<.001) and 76% (14.1/8) more reflections after feedback was removed (P<.001) relative to the control group. The treatment group used more open questions during training but not after feedback was removed, suggesting that certain skills may not improve with performance-based feedback. Finally, after feedback was removed, the ClientBot group used 31% (32.5/24.7) more listening skills overall (P<.001).

METHODS: We analyzed 205,581 user review comments from chatbots designed for users with anxiety and depression symptoms. Using scraper tools and Google Play Scraper and App Store Scraper Python libraries, we extracted the text and metadata. The reviews were divided into positive and negative meta-themes based on users' rating per review. We analyzed the reviews using word frequencies of bigrams and words in pairs. A topic modeling technique, latent Dirichlet allocation, was applied to identify topics in the reviews and analyzed to detect themes and subthemes. RESULTS: Thematic analysis was conducted on 5 topics for each sentimental set. Reviews were categorized as positive or negative. For positive reviews, the main themes were confidence and affirmation building, adequate analysis, and consultation, caring as a friend, and ease of use. For negative reviews, the results revealed the following themes: usability issues, update issues, privacy, and noncreative conversations.

Hence, we will assess thought disorder using the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) heuristic for language production, and its recommended paradigm of ""linguistic corpus-based analyses of language output"". Positive thought disorder (e.g., tangentiality and derailment) can be assessed using word-embedding approaches that assess semantic coherence, whereas negative thought disorder (e.g., concreteness, poverty of speech) can be assessed using part-of-speech (POS) tagging to assess syntactic complexity. We aim to establish convergent validity of automated linguistic metrics with clinical ratings, assess normative demographic variance, determine cognitive and functional correlates, and replicate their predictive power for psychosis transition among at-risk youths. METHODS: This study will assess language production in 450 English-speaking individuals in Australia and Canada, who have recent onset psychosis, are at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis, or who are healthy volunteers, all well-characterized for cognition, function and symptoms. Speech will be elicited using open-ended interviews. Audio files will be transcribed and preprocessed for automated natural language processing (NLP) analyses of coherence and complexity.

METHODS: Patients with breast cancer with LMD were identified using administrative billing codes and NLP review of magnetic resonance imaging reports at 2 tertiary care centers between 2010 and 2016. Next, NLP was used to review clinical notes to (1) determine the presence of palliative care consultations and (2) determine the performance of process measures associated with high-quality EOL care, including discussions of goals of care, code status limitations, and hospice.

Engaging Unmotivated Smokers to Move Toward Quitting: Design of Motivational Interviewing-Based Chatbot Through Iterative Interactions.,Almusharraf F; Rose J; Selby P,"BACKGROUND: At any given time, most smokers in a population are ambivalent with no motivation to quit. Motivational interviewing (MI) is an evidence-based technique that aims to elicit change in ambivalent smokers. MI practitioners are scarce and expensive, and smokers are difficult to reach. Smokers are potentially reachable through the web, and if an automated chatbot could emulate an MI conversation, it could form the basis of a low-cost and scalable intervention motivating smokers to quit. OBJECTIVE: The primary goal of this study is to design, train, and test an automated MI-based chatbot capable of eliciting reflection in a conversation with cigarette smokers. This study describes the process of collecting training data to improve the chatbot's ability to generate MI-oriented responses, particularly reflections and summary statements. The secondary goal of this study is to observe the effects on participants through voluntary feedback given after completing a conversation with the chatbot. METHODS: An interdisciplinary collaboration between an MI expert and experts in computer engineering and natural language processing (NLP) co-designed the conversation and algorithms underlying the chatbot. A sample of 121 adult cigarette smokers in 11 successive groups were recruited from a web-based platform for a single-arm prospective iterative design study. The chatbot was designed to stimulate reflections on the pros and cons of smoking using MI's running head start technique. Participants were also asked to confirm the chatbot's classification of their free-form responses to measure the classification accuracy of the underlying NLP models. Each group provided responses that were used to train the chatbot for the next group. RESULTS: A total of 6568 responses from 121 participants in 11 successive groups over 14 weeks were received. From these responses, we were able to isolate 21 unique reasons for and against smoking and the relative frequency of each. The gradual collection of responses as inputs and smoking reasons as labels over the 11 iterations improved the F1 score of the classification within the chatbot from 0.63 in the first group to 0.82 in the final group. The mean time spent by each participant interacting with the chatbot was 21.3 (SD 14.0) min (minimum 6.4 and maximum 89.2). We also found that 34.7% (42/121) of participants enjoyed the interaction with the chatbot, and 8.3% (10/121) of participants noted explicit smoking cessation benefits from the conversation in voluntary feedback that did not solicit this explicitly. CONCLUSIONS: Recruiting ambivalent smokers through the web is a viable method to train a chatbot to increase accuracy in reflection and summary statements, the building blocks of MI.

In this paper, we aim to extract behavior markers from two modalities, a smart home environment and a custom digital memory notebook app, for mapping to ten clinical assessments that are relevant for monitoring MCI onset and changes in cognitive health. Smart home-based behavior markers reflect hourly, daily, and weekly activity patterns, while app-based behavior markers reflect app usage and writing content/style derived from free-form journal entries. We describe machine learning techniques for fusing these multimodal behavior markers and utilizing joint prediction. We evaluate our approach using three regression algorithms and data from 14 participants with MCI living in a smart home environment.

Linguistic Variables and Gender Differences Within a Messenger-Based Psychosocial Chat Counseling Service for Children and Adolescents: Cross-Sectional Study.,Efe Z; Baldofski S; Kohls E; Eckert M; Saee S; Thomas J; Wundrack R; Rummel-Kluge C,"BACKGROUND: Text messaging is widely used by young people for communicating and seeking mental health support through chat-based helplines. However, written communication lacks nonverbal cues, and language usage is an important source of information about a person's mental health state and is known to be a marker for psychopathology. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to investigate language usage, and its gender differences and associations with the presence of psychiatric symptoms within a chat counseling service for adolescents and young adults. METHODS: For this study, the anonymized chat content of a German messenger-based psychosocial chat counseling service for children and adolescents (""krisenchat"") between May 2020 and July 2021 was analyzed. In total, 661,131 messages from 6962 users were evaluated using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, considering the following linguistic variables: first-person singular and plural pronouns, negations, positive and negative emotion words, insight words, and causation words. Descriptive analyses were performed, and gender differences of those variables were evaluated. Finally, a binary logistic regression analysis examined the predictive value of linguistic variables on the presence of psychiatric symptoms. RESULTS: Across all analyzed chats, first-person singular pronouns were used most frequently (965,542/8,328,309, 11.6%), followed by positive emotion words (408,087/8,328,309, 4.9%), insight words (341,460/8,328,309, 4.1%), negations (316,475/8,328,309, 3.8%), negative emotion words (266,505/8,328,309, 3.2%), causation words (241,520/8,328,309, 2.9%), and first-person plural pronouns (499,698/8,328,309, 0.6%). Female users and users identifying as diverse used significantly more first-person singular pronouns and insight words than male users (both P<.001). Negations were significantly more used by female users than male users or users identifying as diverse (P=.007). Similar findings were noted for negative emotion words (P=.01). The regression model of predicting psychiatric symptoms by linguistic variables was significant and indicated that increased use of first-person singular pronouns (odds ratio [OR] 1.05), negations (OR 1.11), and negative emotion words (OR 1.15) was positively associated with the presence of psychiatric symptoms, whereas increased use of first-person plural pronouns (OR 0.39) and causation words (OR 0.90) was negatively associated with the presence of psychiatric symptoms. Suicidality, self-harm, and depression showed the most significant correlations with linguistic variables. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the importance of examining linguistic features in chat counseling contexts. By integrating psycholinguistic findings into counseling practice, counselors may better understand users' psychological processes and provide more targeted support. For instance, certain linguistic features, such as high use of first-person singular pronouns, negations, or negative emotion words, may indicate the presence of psychiatric symptoms, particularly among female users and users identifying as diverse. Further research is needed to provide an in-depth look into language processes within chat counseling services.",2024,Jan,JMIR Form Res,8,,e51795,,10.2196/51795,38214955,#5881,Efe 2024,"",""
Differences among Research Domain Criteria score trajectories by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual categorical diagnosis during inpatient hospitalization.,McCoy TH Jr; Pellegrini AM; Perlis RH,"With brief psychiatric hospitalizations, the extent to which symptoms change is rarely characterized. We sought to understand symptomatic changes across Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) dimensions, and the extent to which such improvement might be associated with risk for readmission. We identified 3,634 individuals with 4,713 hospital admissions to the psychiatric inpatient unit of a large academic medical center between 2010 and 2015. We applied a natural language processing tool to extract estimates of the five RDoC domains to the admission note and discharge summary and calculated the change in each domain. We examined the extent to which symptom domains changed during admission, and their relationship to baseline clinical and sociodemographic features, using linear regression. Symptomatic worsening was rare in the negative valence (0.4%) and positive valence (5.1%) domains, but more common in cognition (25.8%). Most diagnoses exhibited improvement in negative valence, which was associated with significant reduction in readmission risk. Despite generally brief hospital stays, we detected reduction across multiple symptom domains, with greatest improvement in negative symptoms, and greatest probability of worsening in cognitive symptoms. This approach should facilitate investigations of other features or interventions which may influence pace of clinical improvement.",2020,,PLoS One,15,8,e0237698,,10.1371/journal.pone.0237698,32842139,#5882,McCoyTHJr 2020,"",""
Opportunities for digital health technology: identifying unmet needs for bipolar misdiagnosis and depression care management.,Kark SM; Worthington MA; Christie RH; Masino AJ,"INTRODUCTION: Digital health technologies (DHTs) driven by artificial intelligence applications, particularly those including predictive models derived with machine learning methods, have garnered substantial attention and financial investment in recent years. Yet, there is little evidence of widespread adoption and scant proof of gains in patient health outcomes. One factor of this paradox is the disconnect between DHT developers and digital health ecosystem stakeholders, which can result in developing technologies that are highly sophisticated but clinically irrelevant. Here, we aimed to uncover challenges faced by psychiatrists treating patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Specifically, we focused on challenges psychiatrists raised about bipolar disorder (BD) misdiagnosis. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 10 United States-based psychiatrists. We applied text and thematic analysis to the resulting interview transcripts. RESULTS: Three main themes emerged: (1) BD is often misdiagnosed, (2) information crucial to evaluating BD is often occluded from clinical observation, and (3) BD misdiagnosis has important treatment implications. DISCUSSION: Using upstream stakeholder engagement methods, we were able to identify a narrow, unforeseen, and clinically relevant problem. We propose an organizing framework for development of digital tools based upon clinician-identified unmet need.",2023,,Front Digit Health,5,,1221754,,10.3389/fdgth.2023.1221754,37771820,#5883,Kark 2023,"",""

Hierarchical generalized linear modeling was used to analyze the relationships between adherence to reporting recommendations and negative emotions in readers' comments. None of the media reporting of student suicide was consistent with all of the media recommendations for suicide reporting. Netizens were less likely to post negative comments when the reports describe the suicide method used (OR 1.169, 95% CI 1.022∼1.337), and not specifying the cause of suicide was a protective factor for public negative emotion (OR 0.799, 95% CI 0.707, 0.905).

Natural Language Processing to Assess End-of-Life Quality Indicators in Cancer Patients Receiving Palliative Surgery.,Lindvall C; Lilley EJ; Zupanc SN; Chien I; Udelsman BV; Walling A; Cooper Z; Tulsky JA,"BACKGROUND: Palliative surgical procedures are frequently performed to reduce symptoms in patients with advanced cancer, but quality is difficult to measure. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether natural language processing (NLP) of the electronic health record (EHR) can be used to (1) identify a population of cancer patients receiving palliative gastrostomy and (2) assess documentation of end-of-life process measures in the EHR. DESIGN/SETTING: Retrospective cohort study of 302 adult cancer patients who received a gastrostomy tube at a single tertiary medical center. MEASUREMENTS: Sensitivity and specificity of NLP compared to gold standard of manual chart abstraction in identifying a palliative indication for gastrostomy tube placement and documentation of goals of care discussions, code status determination, palliative care referral, and hospice assessment. RESULTS: Among 302 cancer patients who underwent gastrostomy, 68 (22.5%) were classified by NLP as having a palliative indication for the procedure compared to 71 patients (23.5%) classified by human coders. Human chart abstraction took >2600 times longer than NLP (28 hours vs. 38 seconds). NLP identified the correct patients with 95.8% sensitivity and 97.4% specificity. NLP also identified end-of-life process measures with high sensitivity (85.7%-92.9%,) and specificity (96.7%-98.9%). In the two months leading up to palliative gastrostomy placement, 20.5% of patients had goals of care discussions documented. During the index hospitalization, 67.7% had goals of care discussions documented.

"Detecting Temporal Cognition in Text: Comparison of Judgements by Self, Expert and Machine.",Walsh EI; Busby Grant J,"Background: There is a growing research focus on temporal cognition, due to its importance in memory and planning, and links with psychological wellbeing. Researchers are increasingly using diary studies, experience sampling and social media data to study temporal thought. However, it remains unclear whether such reports can be accurately interpreted for temporal orientation. In this study, temporal orientation judgements about text reports of thoughts were compared across human coding, automatic text mining, and participant self-report. Methods: 214 participants responded to randomly timed text message prompts, categorically reporting the temporal direction of their thoughts and describing the content of their thoughts, producing a corpus of 2505 brief (1-358, M = 43 characters) descriptions. Two researchers independently, blindly coded temporal orientation of the descriptions. Four approaches to automated coding used tense to establish temporal category for each description. Concordance between temporal orientation assessments by self-report, human coding, and automatic text mining was evaluated. Results: Human coding more closely matched self-reported coding than automated methods. Accuracy for human (79.93% correct) and automated (57.44% correct) coding was diminished when multiple guesses at ambiguous temporal categories (ties) were allowed in coding (reduction to 74.95% correct for human, 49.05% automated). Conclusion: Ambiguous tense poses a challenge for both human and automated coding protocols that attempt to infer temporal orientation from text describing momentary thought. While methods can be applied to minimize bias, this study demonstrates that researchers need to be wary about attributing temporal orientation to text-reported thought processes, and emphasize the importance of eliciting self-reported judgements.",2018,,Front Psychol,9,,2037,,10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02037,30416468,#5928,Walsh 2018,"",""
Characterizing Opioid Overdoses Using Emergency Medical Services Data : A Case Definition Algorithm Enhanced by Machine Learning.,Sivaraman JJ; Proescholdbell SK; Ezzell D; Shanahan ME,"OBJECTIVES: Tracking nonfatal overdoses in the escalating opioid overdose epidemic is important but challenging. The objective of this study was to create an innovative case definition of opioid overdose in North Carolina emergency medical services (EMS) data, with flexible methodology for application to other states' data. METHODS: This study used de-identified North Carolina EMS encounter data from 2010-2015 for patients aged >12 years to develop a case definition of opioid overdose using an expert knowledge, rule-based algorithm reflecting whether key variables identified drug use/poisoning or overdose or whether the patient received naloxone. We text mined EMS narratives and applied a machine-learning classification tree model to the text to predict cases of opioid overdose. We trained models on the basis of whether the chief concern identified opioid overdose. RESULTS: Using a random sample from the data, we found the positive predictive value of this case definition to be 90.0%, as compared with 82.7% using a previously published case definition. Using our case definition, the number of unresponsive opioid overdoses increased from 3412 in 2010 to 7194 in 2015. The corresponding monthly rate increased by a factor of 1.7 from January 2010 (3.0 per 1000 encounters; n = 261 encounters) to December 2015 (5.1 per 1000 encounters; n = 622 encounters).

Subtypes in patients with opioid misuse: A prognostic enrichment strategy using electronic health record data in hospitalized patients.,Afshar M; Joyce C; Dligach D; Sharma B; Kania R; Xie M; Swope K; Salisbury-Afshar E; Karnik NS,"BACKGROUND: Approaches are needed to better delineate the continuum of opioid misuse that occurs in hospitalized patients. A prognostic enrichment strategy with latent class analysis (LCA) may facilitate treatment strategies in subtypes of opioid misuse. We aim to identify subtypes of patients with opioid misuse and examine the distinctions between the subtypes by examining patient characteristics, topic models from clinical notes, and clinical outcomes. METHODS: This was an observational study of inpatient hospitalizations at a tertiary care center between 2007 and 2017. Patients with opioid misuse were identified using an operational definition applied to all inpatient encounters. LCA with eight class-defining variables from the electronic health record (EHR) was applied to identify subtypes in the cohort of patients with opioid misuse. Comparisons between subtypes were made using the following approaches: (1) descriptive statistics on patient characteristics and healthcare utilization using EHR data and census-level data; (2) topic models with natural language processing (NLP) from clinical notes; (3) association with hospital outcomes. FINDINGS: The analysis cohort was 6,224 (2.7% of all hospitalizations) patient encounters with opioid misuse with a data corpus of 422,147 clinical notes. LCA identified four subtypes with differing patient characteristics, topics from the clinical notes, and hospital outcomes. Class 1 was categorized by high hospital utilization with known opioid-related conditions (36.5%); Class 2 included patients with illicit use, low socioeconomic status, and psychoses (12.8%); Class 3 contained patients with alcohol use disorders with complications (39.2%); and class 4 consisted of those with low hospital utilization and incidental opioid misuse (11.5%). The following hospital outcomes were the highest for each subtype when compared against the other subtypes: readmission for class 1 (13.9% vs. 10.5%, p<0.01); discharge against medical advice for class 2 (12.3% vs. 5.3%, p<0.01); and in-hospital death for classes 3 and 4 (3.2% vs. 1.9%, p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: A 4-class latent model was the most parsimonious model that defined clinically interpretable and relevant subtypes for opioid misuse. Distinct subtypes were delineated after examining multiple domains of EHR data and applying methods in artificial intelligence. The approach with LCA and readily available class-defining substance use variables from the EHR may be applied as a prognostic enrichment strategy for targeted interventions.",2019,,PLoS One,14,7,e0219717,,10.1371/journal.pone.0219717,31310611,#5949,Afshar 2019,"",""
Toward personalizing treatment for depression: predicting diagnosis and severity.,Huang SH; LePendu P; Iyer SV; Tai-Seale M; Carrell D; Shah NH,"OBJECTIVE: Depression is a prevalent disorder difficult to diagnose and treat. In particular, depressed patients exhibit largely unpredictable responses to treatment. Toward the goal of personalizing treatment for depression, we develop and evaluate computational models that use electronic health record (EHR) data for predicting the diagnosis and severity of depression, and response to treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We develop regression-based models for predicting depression, its severity, and response to treatment from EHR data, using structured diagnosis and medication codes as well as free-text clinical reports. We used two datasets: 35,000 patients (5000 depressed) from the Palo Alto Medical Foundation and 5651 patients treated for depression from the Group Health Research Institute. RESULTS: Our models are able to predict a future diagnosis of depression up to 12 months in advance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.70-0.80). We can differentiate patients with severe baseline depression from those with minimal or mild baseline depression (AUC 0.72). Baseline depression severity was the strongest predictor of treatment response for medication and psychotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to use EHR data to predict a diagnosis of depression up to 12 months in advance and to differentiate between extreme baseline levels of depression. The models use commonly available data on diagnosis, medication, and clinical progress notes, making them easily portable.

Little is known regarding the subjective experience and frequency of bothersome cognitive problems across the range of disease duration as expressed directly in patients' own words. We describe the types and frequency of bothersome cognitive symptoms reported verbatim by patients with PD. METHODS: Through the online Fox Insight study and the Parkinson Disease Patient Report of Problems, we asked patients with PD to self-report by keyboard entry up to five most bothersome problems and how these problems affect their functioning. Human-in-the-loop curation, natural language processing, and machine learning were used to categorize responses into 8 cognitive symptoms: memory, concentration/attention, cognitive slowing, language/word finding, mental alertness/awareness, visuospatial abilities, executive abilities/working memory, and cognitive impairment not otherwise specified. Associations between cognitive symptoms and demographic and disease-related variables were examined in our cross-sectional cohort using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 25,192 participants (55% men) of median age 67 years and 3 years since diagnosis (YSD), 8,001 (32%) reported a cognitive symptom at baseline. The 3 most frequently reported symptoms were memory (13%), language/word finding (12%), and concentration/attention (9%). Depression was significantly associated with bothersome cognitive problems in all domains except visuospatial abilities. Predictors of reporting any cognitive symptom in PD were depression (adjusted OR 1.5), increasing MDS-UPDRS Part II score (OR 1.4 per 10-point increment), higher education (OR 1.2 per year), and YSD 1, 2, 6-7, and 8-9 vs 0 YSD. Among individuals with at least one cognitive symptom, posterior cortical-related cognitive symptoms (i.e., visuospatial, memory, and language) were reported by 17% (n = 4325), frontostriatal-related symptoms (i.e., executive abilities, concentration/attention) by 7% (n = 1,827), and both by 14.2% (n = 1,020). Odds of reporting posterior cortical symptoms vs frontostriatal symptoms increased with age and MDS-UPDRS part II score, but not depression. DISCUSSION: Nearly one-third of participants with PD, even early in the disease course, report cognitive symptoms as among their most bothersome problems.

U.S. mothers' appraisals of the race-related events of 2020: Implications for the course of maternal posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms.,Printz Pereira D; Dominguez Perez S; Milan S,"For parents of color, publicized racial violence can heighten concerns about their children's safety. The goal of this study was to test whether this form of race-related stress exacerbates maternal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms over a 4-month period in families of color. Participants included 262 U.S. mothers with a lifetime mental health diagnosis (67.6% non-Hispanic White, 15.6% African-American/Black, 16.8% other family of color). Mothers completed online surveys and open-ended questions, including appraisals of the meaning of the 2020 race-related events (i.e., George Floyd's death, subsequent protests) in relation to their children's future. Open-ended responses were quantified using LIWC15 text analysis for emotion word frequency and thematic coding for perceived implications. In ANCOVA, there were significant racial group differences in appraisals, ds = 0.09-0.57. The responses from mothers of Black children included fewer positive and more negative emotion words than mothers of White children; they also included more perceived negative implications than all other mothers but did not vary on perceived positive implications. In regression analyses, there were significant moderating effects of race/ethnicity in the association between appraisals and PTSD symptom course such that negative appraisals predicted a subsequent increase in PTSD symptoms only for mothers of Black children, βs = .26-.37. Variations in event appraisals were unrelated to PTSD symptom course for other mothers.

Mobile Phone-Based Unobtrusive Ecological Momentary Assessment of Day-to-Day Mood: An Explorative Study.,Asselbergs J; Ruwaard J; Ejdys M; Schrader N; Sijbrandij M; Riper H,"BACKGROUND: Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is a useful method to tap the dynamics of psychological and behavioral phenomena in real-world contexts. However, the response burden of (self-report) EMA limits its clinical utility. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to explore mobile phone-based unobtrusive EMA, in which mobile phone usage logs are considered as proxy measures of clinically relevant user states and contexts. METHODS: This was an uncontrolled explorative pilot study. Our study consisted of 6 weeks of EMA/unobtrusive EMA data collection in a Dutch student population (N=33), followed by a regression modeling analysis. Participants self-monitored their mood on their mobile phone (EMA) with a one-dimensional mood measure (1 to 10) and a two-dimensional circumplex measure (arousal/valence, -2 to 2). Meanwhile, with participants' consent, a mobile phone app unobtrusively collected (meta) data from six smartphone sensor logs (unobtrusive EMA: calls/short message service (SMS) text messages, screen time, application usage, accelerometer, and phone camera events). Through forward stepwise regression (FSR), we built personalized regression models from the unobtrusive EMA variables to predict day-to-day variation in EMA mood ratings. The predictive performance of these models (ie, cross-validated mean squared error and percentage of correct predictions) was compared to naive benchmark regression models (the mean model and a lag-2 history model). RESULTS: A total of 27 participants (81%) provided a mean 35.5 days (SD 3.8) of valid EMA/unobtrusive EMA data. The FSR models accurately predicted 55% to 76% of EMA mood scores. However, the predictive performance of these models was significantly inferior to that of naive benchmark models. CONCLUSIONS: Mobile phone-based unobtrusive EMA is a technically feasible and potentially powerful EMA variant. The method is young and positive findings may not replicate. At present, we do not recommend the application of FSR-based mood prediction in real-world clinical settings. Further psychometric studies and more advanced data mining techniques are needed to unlock unobtrusive EMA's true potential.",2016,Mar,J Med Internet Res,18,3,e72,,10.2196/jmir.5505,27025287,#5983,Asselbergs 2016,"",""
Predicting changes in substance use following psychedelic experiences: natural language processing of psychedelic session narratives.,Cox DJ; Garcia-Romeu A; Johnson MW,"Background: Experiences with psychedelic drugs, such as psilocybin or lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), are sometimes followed by changes in patterns of tobacco, opioid, and alcohol consumption. But, the specific characteristics of psychedelic experiences that lead to changes in drug consumption are unknown.Objective: Determine whether quantitative descriptions of psychedelic experiences derived using Natural Language Processing (NLP) would allow us to predict who would quit or reduce using drugs following a psychedelic experience.Methods: We recruited 1141 individuals (247 female, 894 male) from online social media platforms who reported quitting or reducing using alcohol, cannabis, opioids, or stimulants following a psychedelic experience to provide a verbal narrative of the psychedelic experience they attributed as leading to their reduction in drug use. We used NLP to derive topic models that quantitatively described each participant's psychedelic experience narrative. We then used the vector descriptions of each participant's psychedelic experience narrative as input into three different supervised machine learning algorithms to predict long-term drug reduction outcomes.Results: We found that the topic models derived through NLP led to quantitative descriptions of participant narratives that differed across participants when grouped by the drug class quit as well as the long-term quit/reduction outcomes. Additionally, all three machine learning algorithms led to similar prediction accuracy (~65%, CI = ±0.21%) for long-term quit/reduction outcomes.Conclusions: Using machine learning to analyze written reports of psychedelic experiences may allow for accurate prediction of quit outcomes and what drug is quit or reduced within psychedelic therapy.",2021,Jul,Am J Drug Alcohol Abuse,47,4,444-454,,10.1080/00952990.2021.1910830,34096403,#5991,Cox 2021,"",""

INTERVENTIONS: The tools comprised a digital survey completed using a tablet device (kiosk) or a pen and paper/online version; guidance and information for patients, carers and staff; text-mining programs; reporting templates; and a process for eliciting and recording verbal feedback in community mental health services. RESULTS: We found a lack of understanding and experience of the process of giving feedback. People wanted more meaningful and informal feedback to suit local contexts. Text mining enabled systematic analysis, although challenges remained, and qualitative analysis provided additional insights. All sites managed to collect feedback digitally; however, there was a perceived need for additional resources, and engagement varied. Observation indicated that patients were apprehensive about using kiosks but often would participate with support. The process for collecting and recording verbal feedback in mental health services made sense to participants, but was not successfully adopted, with staff workload and technical problems often highlighted as barriers. Staff thought that new methods were insightful, but observation did not reveal changes in services during the testing period. CONCLUSIONS: The use of digital methods can produce some improvements in the collection and usefulness of feedback. Context and flexibility are important, and digital methods need to be complemented with alternative methods. Text mining can provide useful analysis for reporting on large data sets within large organisations, but qualitative analysis may be more useful for small data sets and in small organisations. LIMITATIONS: New practices need time and support to be adopted and this study had limited resources and a limited testing time. FUTURE WORK: Further research is needed to improve text-analysis methods for routine use in services and to evaluate the impact of methods (digital and non-digital) on service improvement in varied contexts and among diverse patients and carers.

Validation of electronic health record phenotyping of bipolar disorder cases and controls.,Castro VM; Minnier J; Murphy SN; Kohane I; Churchill SE; Gainer V; Cai T; Hoffnagle AG; Dai Y; Block S; Weill SR; Nadal-Vicens M; Pollastri AR; Rosenquist JN; Goryachev S; Ongur D; Sklar P; Perlis RH; Smoller JW,"OBJECTIVE: The study was designed to validate use of electronic health records (EHRs) for diagnosing bipolar disorder and classifying control subjects. METHOD: EHR data were obtained from a health care system of more than 4.6 million patients spanning more than 20 years. Experienced clinicians reviewed charts to identify text features and coded data consistent or inconsistent with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Natural language processing was used to train a diagnostic algorithm with 95% specificity for classifying bipolar disorder. Filtered coded data were used to derive three additional classification rules for case subjects and one for control subjects. The positive predictive value (PPV) of EHR-based bipolar disorder and subphenotype diagnoses was calculated against diagnoses from direct semistructured interviews of 190 patients by trained clinicians blind to EHR diagnosis. RESULTS: The PPV of bipolar disorder defined by natural language processing was 0.85. Coded classification based on strict filtering achieved a value of 0.79, but classifications based on less stringent criteria performed less well. No EHR-classified control subject received a diagnosis of bipolar disorder on the basis of direct interview (PPV=1.0). For most subphenotypes, values exceeded 0.80. The EHR-based classifications were used to accrue 4,500 bipolar disorder cases and 5,000 controls for genetic analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Semiautomated mining of EHRs can be used to ascertain bipolar disorder patients and control subjects with high specificity and predictive value compared with diagnostic interviews.

Building a Cohort of Transgender and Nonbinary Patients from the Electronic Medical Record.,Beach LB; Hackenberger P; Ascha M; Luehmann N; Felt D; Termanini K; Benning C; Sama D; Barnard C; Jordan SW,"Purpose: Sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex recorded at birth (SOGI) have been routinely excluded from demographic data collection tools, including in electronic medical record (EMR) systems. We assessed the ability of adding structured SOGI data capture to improve identification of transgender and nonbinary (TGNB) patients compared to using only International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes and text mining and comment on the ethics of these cohort formation methods. Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review to classify patient gender at a single institution using ICD-10 codes, structured SOGI data, and text mining for patients presenting for care between March 2019 and February 2021. We report each method's overall and segmental positive predictive value (PPV). Results: We queried 1,530,154 EMRs from our institution. Overall, 154,712 contained relevant ICD-10 diagnosis codes, SOGI data fields, or text mining terms; 2964 were manually reviewed. This multipronged approach identified a final 1685 TGNB patient cohort. The initial PPV was 56.8%, with ICD-10 codes, SOGI data, and text mining having PPV of 99.2%, 47.9%, and 62.2%, respectively. Conclusion: This is one of the first studies to use a combination of structured data capture with keyword terms and ICD codes to identify TGNB patients. Our approach revealed that although structured SOGI documentation was <10% in our health system, 1343/1685 (79.7%) of TGNB patients were identified using this method. We recommend that health systems promote patient EMR documentation of SOGI to improve health and wellness among TGNB populations, while centering patient privacy.",2024,May-Jun,LGBT Health,11,4,310-316,,10.1089/lgbt.2022.0107,38153365,#6023,Beach 2024,"",""

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether natural language processing (NLP)-powered semiautomated annotation can improve the speed and interrater reliability of chart reviews for phenotyping cognitive status. METHODS: In this diagnostic study, we developed and evaluated a semiautomated NLP-powered annotation tool (NAT) to facilitate phenotyping of cognitive status. Clinical experts adjudicated the cognitive status of 627 patients at Mass General Brigham (MGB) health care, using NAT or traditional chart reviews. Patient charts contained EHR data from two data sets: (1) records from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2018, for 100 Medicare beneficiaries from the MGB Accountable Care Organization and (2) records from 2 years prior to COVID-19 diagnosis to the date of COVID-19 diagnosis for 527 MGB patients. All EHR data from the relevant period were extracted; diagnosis codes, medications, and laboratory test values were processed and summarized; clinical notes were processed through an NLP pipeline; and a web tool was developed to present an integrated view of all data. Cognitive status was rated as cognitively normal, cognitively impaired, or undetermined. Assessment time and interrater agreement of NAT compared to manual chart reviews for cognitive status phenotyping was evaluated. RESULTS: NAT adjudication provided higher interrater agreement (Cohen κ=0.89 vs κ=0.80) and significant speed up (time difference mean 1.4, SD 1.3 minutes; P<.001; ratio median 2.2, min-max 0.4-20) over manual chart reviews. There was moderate agreement with manual chart reviews (Cohen κ=0.67). In the cases that exhibited disagreement with manual chart reviews, NAT adjudication was able to produce assessments that had broader clinical consensus due to its integrated view of highlighted relevant information and semiautomated NLP features. CONCLUSIONS: NAT adjudication improves the speed and interrater reliability for phenotyping cognitive status compared to manual chart reviews.

Automated Classification of Cognitive Decline and Probable Alzheimer's Dementia Across Multiple Speech and Language Domains.,He R; Chapin K; Al-Tamimi J; Bel N; Marquié M; Rosende-Roca M; Pytel V; Tartari JP; Alegret M; Sanabria A; Ruiz A; Boada M; Valero S; Hinzen W,"BACKGROUND: Decline in language has emerged as a new potential biomarker for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It remains unclear how sensitive language measures are across different tasks, language domains, and languages, and to what extent changes can be reliably detected in early stages such as subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHOD: Using a scene construction task for speech elicitation in a new Spanish/Catalan speaking cohort (N = 119), we automatically extracted features across seven domains, three acoustic (spectral, cepstral, and voice quality), one prosodic, and three from text (morpholexical, semantic, and syntactic). They were forwarded to a random forest classifier to evaluate the discriminability of participants with probable AD dementia, amnestic and nonamnestic MCI, SCD, and cognitively healthy controls. Repeated-measures analyses of variance and paired-samples Wilcoxon signed-ranks test were used to assess whether and how performance differs significantly across groups and linguistic domains. RESULTS: The performance scores of the machine learning classifier were generally satisfactorily high, with the highest scores over .9. Model performance was significantly different for linguistic domains (p < .001), and speech versus text (p = .043), with speech features outperforming textual features, and voice quality performing best. High diagnostic classification accuracies were seen even within both cognitively healthy (controls vs. SCD) and MCI (amnestic and nonamnestic) groups. CONCLUSION: Speech-based machine learning is powerful in detecting cognitive decline and probable AD dementia across a range of different feature domains, though important differences exist between these domains as well.

Using latent semantic analysis and the predication algorithm to improve extraction of meanings from a diagnostic corpus.,Jorge-Botana G; Olmos R; León JA,"There is currently a widespread interest in indexing and extracting taxonomic information from large text collections. An example is the automatic categorization of informally written medical or psychological diagnoses, followed by the extraction of epidemiological information or even terms and structures needed to formulate guiding questions as an heuristic tool for helping doctors. Vector space models have been successfully used to this end (Lee, Cimino, Zhu, Sable, Shanker, Ely & Yu, 2006; Pakhomov, Buntrock & Chute, 2006). In this study we use a computational model known as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) on a diagnostic corpus with the aim of retrieving definitions (in the form of lists of semantic neighbors) of common structures it contains (e.g. ""storm phobia"", ""dog phobia"") or less common structures that might be formed by logical combinations of categories and diagnostic symptoms (e.g. ""gun personality"" or ""germ personality""). In the quest to bring definitions into line with the meaning of structures and make them in some way representative, various problems commonly arise while recovering content using vector space models. We propose some approaches which bypass these problems, such as Kintsch's (2001) predication algorithm and some corrections to the way lists of neighbors are obtained, which have already been tested on semantic spaces in a non-specific domain (Jorge-Botana, León, Olmos & Hassan-Montero, under review). The results support the idea that the predication algorithm may also be useful for extracting more precise meanings of certain structures from scientific corpora, and that the introduction of some corrections based on vector length may increases its efficiency on non-representative terms.",2009,Nov,Span J Psychol,12,2,424-40,,10.1017/s1138741600001815,19899645,#6057,Jorge-Botana 2009,"",""
Implementing Machine Learning Models for Suicide Risk Prediction in Clinical Practice: Focus Group Study With Hospital Providers.,Bentley KH; Zuromski KL; Fortgang RG; Madsen EM; Kessler D; Lee H; Nock MK; Reis BY; Castro VM; Smoller JW,"BACKGROUND: Interest in developing machine learning models that use electronic health record data to predict patients' risk of suicidal behavior has recently proliferated. However, whether and how such models might be implemented and useful in clinical practice remain unknown. To ultimately make automated suicide risk-prediction models useful in practice, and thus better prevent patient suicides, it is critical to partner with key stakeholders, including the frontline providers who will be using such tools, at each stage of the implementation process. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this focus group study is to inform ongoing and future efforts to deploy suicide risk-prediction models in clinical practice. The specific goals are to better understand hospital providers' current practices for assessing and managing suicide risk; determine providers' perspectives on using automated suicide risk-prediction models in practice; and identify barriers, facilitators, recommendations, and factors to consider. METHODS: We conducted 10 two-hour focus groups with a total of 40 providers from psychiatry, internal medicine and primary care, emergency medicine, and obstetrics and gynecology departments within an urban academic medical center. Audio recordings of open-ended group discussions were transcribed and coded for relevant and recurrent themes by 2 independent study staff members. All coded text was reviewed and discrepancies were resolved in consensus meetings with doctoral-level staff. RESULTS: Although most providers reported using standardized suicide risk assessment tools in their clinical practices, existing tools were commonly described as unhelpful and providers indicated dissatisfaction with current suicide risk assessment methods. Overall, providers' general attitudes toward the practical use of automated suicide risk-prediction models and corresponding clinical decision support tools were positive. Providers were especially interested in the potential to identify high-risk patients who might be missed by traditional screening methods. Some expressed skepticism about the potential usefulness of these models in routine care; specific barriers included concerns about liability, alert fatigue, and increased demand on the health care system. Key facilitators included presenting specific patient-level features contributing to risk scores, emphasizing changes in risk over time, and developing systematic clinical workflows and provider training. Participants also recommended considering risk-prediction windows, timing of alerts, who will have access to model predictions, and variability across treatment settings. CONCLUSIONS: Providers were dissatisfied with current suicide risk assessment methods and were open to the use of a machine learning-based risk-prediction system to inform clinical decision-making. They also raised multiple concerns about potential barriers to the usefulness of this approach and suggested several possible facilitators. Future efforts in this area will benefit from incorporating systematic qualitative feedback from providers, patients, administrators, and payers on the use of these new approaches in routine care, especially given the complex, sensitive, and unfortunately still stigmatized nature of suicide risk.",2022,Mar,JMIR Form Res,6,3,e30946,,10.2196/30946,35275075,#6068,Bentley 2022,"",""
Let the algorithm speak: How to use neural networks for automatic item generation in psychological scale development.,Götz FM; Maertens R; Loomba S; van der Linden S,"Measurement is at the heart of scientific research. As many-perhaps most-psychological constructs cannot be directly observed, there is a steady demand for reliable self-report scales to assess latent constructs. However, scale development is a tedious process that requires researchers to produce good items in large quantities. In this tutorial, we introduce, explain, and apply the Psychometric Item Generator (PIG), an open-source, free-to-use, self-sufficient natural language processing algorithm that produces large-scale, human-like, customized text output within a few mouse clicks. The PIG is based on the GPT-2, a powerful generative language model, and runs on Google Colaboratory-an interactive virtual notebook environment that executes code on state-of-the-art virtual machines at no cost. Across two demonstrations and a preregistered five-pronged empirical validation with two Canadian samples (N(Sample 1) = 501, N(Sample 2) = 773), we show that the PIG is equally well-suited to generate large pools of face-valid items for novel constructs (i.e., wanderlust) and create parsimonious short scales of existing constructs (i.e., Big Five personality traits) that yield strong performances when tested in the wild and benchmarked against current gold standards for assessment. The PIG does not require any prior coding skills or access to computational resources and can easily be tailored to any desired context by simply switching out short linguistic prompts in a single line of code. In short, we present an effective, novel machine learning solution to an old psychological challenge. As such, the PIG will not require you to learn a new language-but instead, speak yours.

Communicative Blame in Online Communication of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Computational Approach of Stigmatizing Cues and Negative Sentiment Gauged With Automated Analytic Techniques.,Chang A; Schulz PJ; Tu S; Liu MT,"BACKGROUND: Information about a new coronavirus emerged in 2019 and rapidly spread around the world, gaining significant public attention and attracting negative bias. The use of stigmatizing language for the purpose of blaming sparked a debate. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify social stigma and negative sentiment toward the blameworthy agents in social communities. METHODS: We enabled a tailored text-mining platform to identify data in their natural settings by retrieving and filtering online sources, and constructed vocabularies and learning word representations from natural language processing for deductive analysis along with the research theme. The data sources comprised of ten news websites, eleven discussion forums, one social network, and two principal media sharing networks in Taiwan. A synthesis of news and social networking analytics was present from December 30, 2019, to March 31, 2020. RESULTS: We collated over 1.07 million Chinese texts. Almost two-thirds of the texts on COVID-19 came from news services (n=683,887, 63.68%), followed by Facebook (n=297,823, 27.73%), discussion forums (n=62,119, 5.78%), and Instagram and YouTube (n=30,154, 2.81%). Our data showed that online news served as a hotbed for negativity and for driving emotional social posts. Online information regarding COVID-19 associated it with China-and a specific city within China through references to the ""Wuhan pneumonia""-potentially encouraging xenophobia. The adoption of this problematic moniker had a high frequency, despite the World Health Organization guideline to avoid biased perceptions and ethnic discrimination. Social stigma is disclosed through negatively valenced responses, which are associated with the most blamed targets. CONCLUSIONS: Our sample is sufficiently representative of a community because it contains a broad range of mainstream online media. Stigmatizing language linked to the COVID-19 pandemic shows a lack of civic responsibility that encourages bias, hostility, and discrimination. Frequently used stigmatizing terms were deemed offensive, and they might have contributed to recent backlashes against China by directing blame and encouraging xenophobia. The implications ranging from health risk communication to stigma mitigation and xenophobia concerns amid the COVID-19 outbreak are emphasized. Understanding the nomenclature and biased terms employed in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak is paramount. We propose solidarity with communication professionals in combating the COVID-19 outbreak and the infodemic. Finding solutions to curb the spread of virus bias, stigma, and discrimination is imperative.",2020,Nov,J Med Internet Res,22,11,e21504,,10.2196/21504,33108306,#6096,Chang 2020,"",""
Impact of COVID-19 on mental health in China: analysis based on sentiment knowledge enhanced pre-training and XGBoost algorithm.,Huang R; Wang X,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is causing a serious impact on the people living in countries across the entire world. The spread of this pandemic globally has led people worry every day about losing their jobs or even being threatened by the virus. This pandemic caused people to experience more serious psychological problems than we realized. However, there has been little research on how COVID-19 affects the mental health of the people. In this article, we attempted to use the social text data about COVID-19 on Sina Weibo (the largest ""tweet"" platform in China, and we will also call Weibo as tweet in the following content), to explore the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of Chinese people. First, we fifilter the tweet data by selecting examples that contain COVID-19 and COVID-19 correlated keywords. However, we segment the filtered tweets, extract meaningful words, and construct a word vector sparse matrix as the measurement of every tweet. Then, for the model's labels, we use sentiment knowledge enhanced pre-training model (SKEP), a deep learning framework published by Baidu that measures the user's mental state. Through SKEP, we can obtain the probabilities of the user's positive and negative mental states. Finally, we use the XGBoost algorithm to study the relationship between the word vector sparse matrix and the mental health state of users. Our research shows that social text data can, indeed, reflect the mental health state of users to a large extent, and social data can be used to explore the impact of COVID-19 on mental health, which can help frame the public health policy.",2023,,Front Public Health,11,,1170838,,10.3389/fpubh.2023.1170838,37483949,#6100,Huang 2023,"",""

Understanding how loneliness manifests is important for targeted public health treatment and intervention. With advances in mobile sending and wearable technologies, it is possible to collect data on human phenomena in a continuous and uninterrupted way. In doing so, such approaches can be used to monitor physiological and behavioral aspects relevant to an individual's loneliness. In this study, we proposed a method for continuous detection of loneliness using fully objective data from smart devices and passive mobile sensing. We also investigated whether physiological and behavioral features differed in their importance in predicting loneliness across individuals. Finally, we examined how informative data from each device is for loneliness detection tasks. We assessed subjective feelings of loneliness while monitoring behavioral and physiological patterns in 30 college students over a 2-month period. We used smartphones to monitor behavioral patterns (e.g., location changes, type of notifications, in-coming and out-going calls/text messages) and smart watches and rings to monitor physiology and sleep patterns (e.g., heart-rate, heart-rate variability, sleep duration). Participants reported their loneliness feeling multiple times a day through a questionnaire app on their phone. Using the data collected from their devices, we trained a random forest machine learning based model to detect loneliness levels. We found support for loneliness prediction using a multi-device and fully-objective approach.

Machine learning to support social media empowered patients in cancer care and cancer treatment decisions.,De Silva D; Ranasinghe W; Bandaragoda T; Adikari A; Mills N; Iddamalgoda L; Alahakoon D; Lawrentschuk N; Persad R; Osipov E; Gray R; Bolton D,"BACKGROUND: A primary variant of social media, online support groups (OSG) extend beyond the standard definition to incorporate a dimension of advice, support and guidance for patients. OSG are complementary, yet significant adjunct to patient journeys. Machine learning and natural language processing techniques can be applied to these large volumes of unstructured text discussions accumulated in OSG for intelligent extraction of patient-reported demographics, behaviours, decisions, treatment, side effects and expressions of emotions. New insights from the fusion and synthesis of such diverse patient-reported information, as expressed throughout the patient journey from diagnosis to treatment and recovery, can contribute towards informed decision-making on personalized healthcare delivery and the development of healthcare policy guidelines. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We have designed and developed an artificial intelligence based analytics framework using machine learning and natural language processing techniques for intelligent analysis and automated aggregation of patient information and interaction trajectories in online support groups. Alongside the social interactions aspect, patient behaviours, decisions, demographics, clinical factors, emotions, as subsequently expressed over time, are extracted and analysed. More specifically, we utilised this platform to investigate the impact of online social influences on the intimate decision scenario of selecting a treatment type, recovery after treatment, side effects and emotions expressed over time, using prostate cancer as a model. Results manifest the three major decision-making behaviours among patients, Paternalistic group, Autonomous group and Shared group. Furthermore, each group demonstrated diverse behaviours in post-decision discussions on clinical outcomes, advice and expressions of emotion during the twelve months following treatment. Over time, the transition of patients from information and emotional support seeking behaviours to providers of information and emotional support to other patients was also observed. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study are a rigorous indication of the expectations of social media empowered patients, their potential for individualised decision-making, clinical and emotional needs. The increasing popularity of OSG further confirms that it is timely for clinicians to consider patient voices as expressed in OSG. We have successfully demonstrated that the proposed platform can be utilised to investigate, analyse and derive actionable insights from patient-reported information on prostate cancer, in support of patient focused healthcare delivery. The platform can be extended and applied just as effectively to any other medical condition.",2018,,PLoS One,13,10,e0205855,,10.1371/journal.pone.0205855,30335805,#6175,DeSilva 2018,"",""

Identifying Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease on Twitter and Learning From Their Personal Experience: Retrospective Cohort Study.,Stemmer M; Parmet Y; Ravid G,"BACKGROUND: Patients use social media as an alternative information source, where they share information and provide social support. Although large amounts of health-related data are posted on Twitter and other social networking platforms each day, research using social media data to understand chronic conditions and patients' lifestyles is limited. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we contributed to closing this gap by providing a framework for identifying patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) on Twitter and learning from their personal experiences. We enabled the analysis of patients' tweets by building a classifier of Twitter users that distinguishes patients from other entities. This study aimed to uncover the potential of using Twitter data to promote the well-being of patients with IBD by relying on the wisdom of the crowd to identify healthy lifestyles. We sought to leverage posts describing patients' daily activities and their influence on their well-being to characterize lifestyle-related treatments. METHODS: In the first stage of the study, a machine learning method combining social network analysis and natural language processing was used to automatically classify users as patients or not. We considered 3 types of features: the user's behavior on Twitter, the content of the user's tweets, and the social structure of the user's network. We compared the performances of several classification algorithms within 2 classification approaches. One classified each tweet and deduced the user's class from their tweet-level classification. The other aggregated tweet-level features to user-level features and classified the users themselves. Different classification algorithms were examined and compared using 4 measures: precision, recall, F1 score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. In the second stage, a classifier from the first stage was used to collect patients' tweets describing the different lifestyles patients adopt to deal with their disease. Using IBM Watson Service for entity sentiment analysis, we calculated the average sentiment of 420 lifestyle-related words that patients with IBD use when describing their daily routine. RESULTS: Both classification approaches showed promising results. Although the precision rates were slightly higher for the tweet-level approach, the recall and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the user-level approach were significantly better. Sentiment analysis of tweets written by patients with IBD identified frequently mentioned lifestyles and their influence on patients' well-being. The findings reinforced what is known about suitable nutrition for IBD as several foods known to cause inflammation were pointed out in negative sentiment, whereas relaxing activities and anti-inflammatory foods surfaced in a positive context. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests a pipeline for identifying patients with IBD on Twitter and collecting their tweets to analyze the experimental knowledge they share. These methods can be adapted to other diseases and enhance medical research on chronic conditions.",2022,Aug,J Med Internet Res,24,8,e29186,,10.2196/29186,35917151,#6186,Stemmer 2022,"",""
Implementation of a machine learning algorithm for automated thematic annotations in avatar: A linear support vector classifier approach.,Hudon A; Beaudoin M; Phraxayavong K; Dellazizzo L; Potvin S; Dumais A,Avatar Therapy (AT) is a modern therapeutic alternative for patients with schizophrenia suffering from persistent auditory verbal hallucinations. Its intrinsic therapeutical process is currently qualitatively analyzed via human coders that annotate session transcripts. This process is time and resource demanding. This creates a need to find potential algorithms that can operate on small datasets and perform such annotations. The first objective of this study is to conduct the automated text classification of interactions in AT and the second objective is to assess if this classification is comparable to the classification done by human coders. A Linear Support Vector Classifier was implemented to perform automated theme classifications on Avatar Therapy session transcripts with the use of a limited dataset with an accuracy of 66.02% and substantial classification agreement of 0.647.

Cannabis use and treatment resistance in first episode psychosis: a natural language processing study.,Patel R; Wilson R; Jackson R; Ball M; Shetty H; Broadbent M; Stewart R; McGuire P; Bhattacharyya S,"BACKGROUND: Cannabis is frequently used among individuals with first episode psychosis and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. However, little is known about the effect of cannabis use on the response to antipsychotic medications and how use could affect outcomes. Using natural language processing on clinical data from a large electronic case register, we sought to investigate whether resistance to antipsychotic treatment mediated poor clinical outcomes associated with cannabis use. METHODS: Data were obtained from 2026 people with first episode psychosis in south London, UK. Cannabis use documented in free text clinical records was identified with natural language processing. Data for age, sex, ethnicity, marital status, psychotic disorder diagnosis, subsequent hospital admission, and number of unique antipsychotic medications prescribed were obtained using the Clinical Record Interactive Search instrument. The association of these variables with cannabis use was analysed with multivariable regression and mediation analysis. FINDINGS: 939 people (46·3%) with first episode psychosis were using cannabis at first presentation. Cannabis use was most strongly associated with being 16-25 years old, male, and single, and was also associated with an increase in number of hospital admissions (incidence rate ratio 1·50, 95% CI 1·25-1·80), compulsory hospital admission (odds ratio 1·55, 1·16-2·08), and number of days spent in hospital (β coefficient 35·1 days, 12·1-58·1) over 5 years' follow-up. An increase in number of unique antipsychotic medications mediated an increase in number of hospital admissions (natural indirect effect 1·11, 1·04-1·17; total effect 1·41, 1·22-1·64), compulsory hospital admission (1·27, 1·10-1·45; 1·71, 1·05-2·78), and number of days spent in hospital (16·1, 6·7-25·5; 19·9, 2·5-37·3). INTERPRETATION: We showed that a substantial number of people with first episode psychosis used cannabis and that its use was associated with increased likelihood of hospital admission and number of days spent in hospital. These associations were partly mediated by an increase in number of unique antipsychotic medications prescribed. These findings suggest that cannabis might reduce response to conventional antipsychotic treatment and highlight the importance of strategies to reduce its use.

Facilitative Effects of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation on Semantic Memory Examined by Text-Mining Analysis in Patients With Schizophrenia.,Sumiyoshi C; Narita Z; Inagawa T; Yamada Y; Sueyoshi K; Hasegawa Y; Shirama A; Hashimoto R; Sumiyoshi T,"Background: Beneficial effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are relevant to cognition and functional capacity, in addition to psychiatric symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. However, whether tDCS would improve higher-order cognition, e.g., semantic memory organization, has remained unclear. Recently, text-mining analyses have been shown to reveal semantic memory. The purpose of the current study was to determine whether tDCS would improve semantic memory, as evaluated by text-mining analyses of category fluency data, in patients with schizophrenia. Methods: Twenty-eight patients entered the study. Cognitive assessment including the category fluency task was conducted at baseline (before tDCS treatment) and 1 month after t administration of tDCS (2 mA × 20 min, twice per day) for 5 days, according to our previous study. The category fluency data were also obtained from 335 healthy control subjects. The verbal outputs (i.e., animal names) from the category fluency task were submitted to singular valued decomposition (SVD) analysis. Semantic memory structures were estimated by calculating inter-item cosines (i.e., similarities) among animal names frequently produced in the category fluency task. Data were analyzed longitudinally and cross-sectionally to compare the semantic structure within the patient group (i.e., baseline vs. follow-up) and between groups (patients vs. healthy controls). In the former, semantic associations for frequent items were compared in the form of cosine profiles, while in the latter, the difference in the magnitude of the correlations for inter-item cosines between healthy controls and patients (baseline, follow-up) was examined. Results: Cosine profiles in the patient group became more cluster-based (i.e., pet, carnivores, and herbivores) at follow-up compared to those at baseline, yielding higher cosines within subcategories. The correlational coefficient of inter-item cosines between healthy controls and patients was significantly greater at follow-up compared to baseline; semantic associations in patients approached the normality status after multi-session tDCS. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the facilitative effect of tDCS on semantic memory organization in patients with schizophrenia. Text-mining analysis was indicated to effectively evaluate semantic memory structures in patients with psychiatric disorders.",2021,,Front Neurol,12,,583027,,10.3389/fneur.2021.583027,33643185,#6202,Sumiyoshi 2021,"",""
Documented Reasons of Cancellation and Rescheduling of Telehealth Appointments During the Pandemic.,Sezgin E; Huang Y; Lin D; Ramtekkar U; Pauline L; Lin S,"Background and Objective:The COVID-19 pandemic increased the use of telehealth around the world. The aim is to minimize health care service disruption as well as reducing COVID-19 exposure. However, one of the major operational concerns is cancellations and rescheduling (C/Rs). C/Rs may create additional burden and cost to the patient, provider, and the health system. Our aim is to understand the reasons for C/Rs of the telehealth session after the scheduled start time.Materials and Methods:We reviewed electronic health records (EHRs) to identify the C/R reasons for behavioral health and speech language pathology departments. Documented C/Rs in the medical charts were identified from EHR by using a keyword-based and Natural Language Processing (NLP)-supported EHR search engine. From the search results, we randomly selected 200 notes and conducted a thematic analysis.Results:We identified four themes explaining C/R reasons. Most frequent theme was ""technicality"" (47, 36%), followed by ""engagement"" (34, 25%), ""scheduling"" (31, 24%), and ""unspecified"" (20, 15%). The findings showed that technical reasons are the leading cause of C/Rs, constituting 36% of the cases (95% confidence interval [CI]: 29-43%). Notably, ""engagement"" constituted a sizeable 25% (95% CI: 19-31%) of C/Rs, as a result of the inability to engage a patient to complete the telehealth session.Conclusions:The study shows that engagement is one of the new challenges to the pediatric telehealth visits. Future studies of new engagement models are needed for the success of telehealth. Our findings will help fill the literature gaps and may help with enhancing the digital experience for both caregivers and providers, reducing wasted time and resources due to preventable C/Rs, improving clinical operation efficiency, and treatment adherence.",2021,Oct,Telemed J E Health,27,10,1143-1150,,10.1089/tmj.2020.0454,33373553,#6213,Sezgin 2021,"",""
An Automated Quality Evaluation Framework of Psychotherapy Conversations with Local Quality Estimates.,Chen Z; Flemotomos N; Singla K; Creed TA; Atkins DC; Narayanan S,"Text-based computational approaches for assessing the quality of psychotherapy are being developed to support quality assurance and clinical training. However, due to the long durations of typical conversation based therapy sessions, and due to limited annotated modeling resources, computational methods largely rely on frequency-based lexical features or dialogue acts to assess the overall session level characteristics. In this work, we propose a hierarchical framework to automatically evaluate the quality of transcribed Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) interactions. Given the richly dynamic nature of the spoken dialog within a talk therapy session, to evaluate the overall session level quality, we propose to consider modeling it as a function of local variations across the interaction. To implement that empirically, we divide each psychotherapy session into conversation segments and initialize the segment-level qualities with the session-level scores. First, we produce segment embeddings by fine-tuning a BERT-based model, and predict segment-level (local) quality scores. These embeddings are used as the lower-level input to a Bidirectional LSTM-based neural network to predict the session-level (global) quality estimates. In particular, we model the global quality as a linear function of the local quality scores, which allows us to update the segment-level quality estimates based on the session-level quality prediction. These newly estimated segment-level scores benefit the BERT fine-tuning process, which in turn results in better segment embeddings. We evaluate the proposed framework on automatically derived transcriptions from real-world CBT clinical recordings to predict session-level behavior codes. The results indicate that our approach leads to improved evaluation accuracy for most codes when used for both regression and classification tasks.",2022,Sep,Comput Speech Lang,75,,,,10.1016/j.csl.2022.101380,35479611,#6225,Chen 2022,"",""
Predicting Early Warning Signs of Psychotic Relapse From Passive Sensing Data: An Approach Using Encoder-Decoder Neural Networks.,Adler DA; Ben-Zeev D; Tseng VW; Kane JM; Brian R; Campbell AT; Hauser M; Scherer EA; Choudhury T,"BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs) are chronic conditions, but the severity of symptomatic experiences and functional impairments vacillate over the course of illness. Developing unobtrusive remote monitoring systems to detect early warning signs of impending symptomatic relapses would allow clinicians to intervene before the patient's condition worsens. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aim to create the first models, exclusively using passive sensing data from a smartphone, to predict behavioral anomalies that could indicate early warning signs of a psychotic relapse. METHODS: Data used to train and test the models were collected during the CrossCheck study. Hourly features derived from smartphone passive sensing data were extracted from 60 patients with SSDs (42 nonrelapse and 18 relapse >1 time throughout the study) and used to train models and test performance. We trained 2 types of encoder-decoder neural network models and a clustering-based local outlier factor model to predict behavioral anomalies that occurred within the 30-day period before a participant's date of relapse (the near relapse period). Models were trained to recreate participant behavior on days of relative health (DRH, outside of the near relapse period), following which a threshold to the recreation error was applied to predict anomalies. The neural network model architecture and the percentage of relapse participant data used to train all models were varied. RESULTS: A total of 20,137 days of collected data were analyzed, with 726 days of data (0.037%) within any 30-day near relapse period. The best performing model used a fully connected neural network autoencoder architecture and achieved a median sensitivity of 0.25 (IQR 0.15-1.00) and specificity of 0.88 (IQR 0.14-0.96; a median 108% increase in behavioral anomalies near relapse). We conducted a post hoc analysis using the best performing model to identify behavioral features that had a medium-to-large effect (Cohen d>0.5) in distinguishing anomalies near relapse from DRH among 4 participants who relapsed multiple times throughout the study. Qualitative validation using clinical notes collected during the original CrossCheck study showed that the identified features from our analysis were presented to clinicians during relapse events. CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed method predicted a higher rate of anomalies in patients with SSDs within the 30-day near relapse period and can be used to uncover individual-level behaviors that change before relapse. This approach will enable technologists and clinicians to build unobtrusive digital mental health tools that can predict incipient relapse in SSDs.",2020,Aug,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,8,8,e19962,,10.2196/19962,32865506,#6230,Adler 2020,"",""

Leveraging Knowledge Graphs and Natural Language Processing for Automated Web Resource Labeling and Knowledge Mobilization in Neurodevelopmental Disorders: Development and Usability Study.,Costello J; Kaur M; Reformat MZ; Bolduc FV,"BACKGROUND: Patients and families need to be provided with trusted information more than ever with the abundance of online information. Several organizations aim to build databases that can be searched based on the needs of target groups. One such group is individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) and their families. NDDs affect up to 18% of the population and have major social and economic impacts. The current limitations in communicating information for individuals with NDDs include the absence of shared terminology and the lack of efficient labeling processes for web resources. Because of these limitations, health professionals, support groups, and families are unable to share, combine, and access resources. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop a natural language-based pipeline to label resources by leveraging standard and free-text vocabularies obtained through text analysis, and then represent those resources as a weighted knowledge graph. METHODS: Using a combination of experts and service/organization databases, we created a data set of web resources for NDDs. Text from these websites was scraped and collected into a corpus of textual data on NDDs. This corpus was used to construct a knowledge graph suitable for use by both experts and nonexperts. Named entity recognition, topic modeling, document classification, and location detection were used to extract knowledge from the corpus. RESULTS: We developed a resource annotation pipeline using diverse natural language processing algorithms to annotate web resources and stored them in a structured knowledge graph. The graph contained 78,181 annotations obtained from the combination of standard terminologies and a free-text vocabulary obtained using topic modeling. An application of the constructed knowledge graph is a resource search interface using the ordered weighted averaging operator to rank resources based on a user query. CONCLUSIONS: We developed an automated labeling pipeline for web resources on NDDs. This work showcases how artificial intelligence-based methods, such as natural language processing and knowledge graphs for information representation, can enhance knowledge extraction and mobilization, and could be used in other fields of medicine.",2023,Apr,J Med Internet Res,25,,e45268,,10.2196/45268,37067865,#6293,Costello 2023,"",""
Latent semantic variables are associated with formal thought disorder and adaptive behavior in older inpatients with schizophrenia.,Holshausen K; Harvey PD; Elvevåg B; Foltz PW; Bowie CR,"INTRODUCTION: Formal thought disorder is a hallmark feature of schizophrenia in which disorganized thoughts manifest as disordered speech. A dysfunctional semantic system and a disruption in executive functioning have been proposed as possible mechanisms for formal thought disorder and verbal fluency impairment. Traditional rating scales and neuropsychological test scores might not be sensitive enough to distinguish among types of semantic impairments. This has lead to the proposed used of a natural language processing technique, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), which offers improved semantic sensitivity. METHOD: In this study, LSA, a computational, vector-based text analysis technique to examine the contribution of vector length, an LSA measure related to word unusualness and cosines between word vectors, an LSA measure of semantic coherence to semantic and phonological fluency, disconnectedness of speech, and adaptive functioning in 165 older inpatients with schizophrenia. RESULTS: In stepwise regressions word unusualness was significantly associated with semantic fluency and phonological fluency, disconnectedness in speech, and impaired functioning, even after considering the contribution of premorbid cognition, positive and negative symptoms, and demographic variables. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the utility of LSA in examining the contribution of coherence to thought disorder and the its relationship with daily functioning.

Impact of Potential Case Misclassification by Administrative Diagnostic Codes on Outcome Assessment of Observational Study for People Who Inject Drugs.,Goodman-Meza D; Goto M; Salimian A; Shoptaw S; Bui AAT; Gordon AJ; Goetz MB,"INTRODUCTION: Initiation of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) within the hospital setting may improve outcomes for people who inject drugs (PWID) hospitalized because of an infection. Many studies used International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes to identify PWID, although these may be misclassified and thus, inaccurate. We hypothesized that bias from misclassification of PWID using ICD codes may impact analyses of MOUD outcomes. METHODS: We analyzed a cohort of 36 868 cases of patients diagnosed with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia at 124 US Veterans Health Administration hospitals between 2003 and 2014. To identify PWID, we implemented an ICD code-based algorithm and a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm for classification of admission notes. We analyzed outcomes of prescribing MOUD as an inpatient using both approaches. Our primary outcome was 365-day all-cause mortality. We fit mixed-effects Cox regression models with receipt or not of MOUD during the index hospitalization as the primary predictor and 365-day mortality as the outcome. RESULTS: NLP identified 2389 cases as PWID, whereas ICD codes identified 6804 cases as PWID. In the cohort identified by NLP, receipt of inpatient MOUD was associated with a protective effect on 365-day survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.48; 95% confidence interval, .29-.81; P < .01) compared with those not receiving MOUD. There was no significant effect of MOUD receipt in the cohort identified by ICD codes (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, .77-1.30; P = .99).

The #MeToo Movement in the United States: Text Analysis of Early Twitter Conversations.,Modrek S; Chakalov B,"BACKGROUND: The #MeToo movement sparked an international debate on the sexual harassment, abuse, and assault and has taken many directions since its inception in October of 2017. Much of the early conversation took place on public social media sites such as Twitter, where the hashtag movement began. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to document, characterize, and quantify early public discourse and conversation of the #MeToo movement from Twitter data in the United States. We focus on posts with public first-person revelations of sexual assault/abuse and early life experiences of such events. METHODS: We purchased full tweets and associated metadata from the Twitter Premium application programming interface between October 14 and 21, 2017 (ie, the first week of the movement). We examined the content of novel English language tweets with the phrase ""MeToo"" from within the United States (N=11,935). We used machine learning methods, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, and support vector machine models to summarize and classify the content of individual tweets with revelations of sexual assault and abuse and early life experiences of sexual assault and abuse. RESULTS: We found that the most predictive words created a vivid archetype of the revelations of sexual assault and abuse. We then estimated that in the first week of the movement, 11% of novel English language tweets with the words ""MeToo"" revealed details about the poster's experience of sexual assault or abuse and 5.8% revealed early life experiences of such events. We examined the demographic composition of posters of sexual assault and abuse and found that white women aged 25-50 years were overrepresented in terms of their representation on Twitter. Furthermore, we found that the mass sharing of personal experiences of sexual assault and abuse had a large reach, where 6 to 34 million Twitter users may have seen such first-person revelations from someone they followed in the first week of the movement. CONCLUSIONS: These data illustrate that revelations shared went beyond acknowledgement of having experienced sexual harassment and often included vivid and traumatic descriptions of early life experiences of assault and abuse. These findings and methods underscore the value of content analysis, supported by novel machine learning methods, to improve our understanding of how widespread the revelations were, which likely amplified the spread and saliency of the #MeToo movement.",2019,Sep,J Med Internet Res,21,9,e13837,,10.2196/13837,31482849,#6332,Modrek 2019,"",""

Among them, compared to ""text + audio,"" using ""text + audio + video/face to face"" can significantly improve the users' perceived social support and satisfaction. However, compared to single medium, mixed media with higher richness may not necessarily achieve a better effect.

The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this problem, and digital tools have been proposed as a solution. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to present the development, feasibility, and potential effectiveness of Vickybot, a chatbot aimed at screening, monitoring, and reducing anxiety-depressive symptoms and work-related burnout, and detecting suicide risk in patients from PC and health care workers. METHODS: Healthy controls (HCs) tested Vickybot for reliability. For the simulation study, HCs used Vickybot for 2 weeks to simulate different clinical situations. For feasibility and effectiveness study, people consulting PC or health care workers with mental health problems used Vickybot for 1 month. Self-assessments for anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item) and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) symptoms and work-related burnout (based on the Maslach Burnout Inventory) were administered at baseline and every 2 weeks. Feasibility was determined from both subjective and objective user-engagement indicators (UEIs). Potential effectiveness was measured using paired 2-tailed t tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank test for changes in self-assessment scores. RESULTS: Overall, 40 HCs tested Vickybot simultaneously, and the data were reliably transmitted and registered. For simulation, 17 HCs (n=13, 76% female; mean age 36.5, SD 9.7 years) received 98.8% of the expected modules. Suicidal alerts were received correctly. For the feasibility and potential effectiveness study, 34 patients (15 from PC and 19 health care workers; 76% [26/34] female; mean age 35.3, SD 10.1 years) completed the first self-assessments, with 100% (34/34) presenting anxiety symptoms, 94% (32/34) depressive symptoms, and 65% (22/34) work-related burnout. In addition, 27% (9/34) of patients completed the second self-assessment after 2 weeks of use. No significant differences were found between the first and second self-assessments for anxiety (t(8)=1.000; P=.34) or depressive (t(8)=0.40; P=.70) symptoms. However, work-related burnout scores were moderately reduced (z=-2.07, P=.04, r=0.32). There was a nonsignificant trend toward a greater reduction in anxiety-depressive symptoms and work-related burnout with greater use of the chatbot. Furthermore, 9% (3/34) of patients activated the suicide alert, and the research team promptly intervened with successful outcomes. Vickybot showed high subjective UEI (acceptability, usability, and satisfaction), but low objective UEI (completion, adherence, compliance, and engagement). Vickybot was moderately feasible. CONCLUSIONS: The chatbot was useful in screening for the presence and severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms, and for detecting suicidal risk. Potential effectiveness was shown to reduce work-related burnout but not anxiety or depressive symptoms. Subjective perceptions of use contrasted with low objective-use metrics. Our results are promising but suggest the need to adapt and enhance the smartphone-based solution to improve engagement. A consensus on how to report UEIs and validate digital solutions, particularly for chatbots, is required.",2023,Apr,J Med Internet Res,25,,e43293,,10.2196/43293,36719325,#6356,Anmella 2023,"",""
Emotion sharing in remote patient monitoring of patients with chronic kidney disease.,Huang R; Liu N; Nicdao MA; Mikaheal M; Baldacchino T; Albeos A; Petoumenos K; Sud K; Kim J,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between emotion sharing and technically troubled dialysis (TTD) in a remote patient monitoring (RPM) setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A custom software system was developed for home hemodialysis patients to use in an RPM setting, with focus on emoticon sharing and sentiment analysis of patients' text data. We analyzed the outcome of emoticon and sentiment against TTD. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between patients' emotions (emoticon and sentiment) and TTD. RESULTS: Usage data were collected from January 1, 2015 to June 1, 2018 from 156 patients that actively used the app system, with a total of 31 159 dialysis sessions recorded. Overall, 122 patients (78%) made use of the emoticon feature while 146 patients (94%) wrote at least 1 or more session notes for sentiment analysis. In total, 4087 (13%) sessions were classified as TTD. In the multivariate model, when compared to sessions with self-reported very happy emoticons, those with sad emoticons showed significantly higher associations to TTD (aOR 4.97; 95% CI 4.13-5.99; P = < .001). Similarly, negative sentiments also revealed significant associations to TTD (aOR 1.56; 95% CI 1.22-2; P = .003) when compared to positive sentiments. DISCUSSION: The distribution of emoticons varied greatly when compared to sentiment analysis outcomes due to the differences in the design features. The emoticon feature was generally easier to understand and quicker to input while the sentiment analysis required patients to manually input their personal thoughts. CONCLUSION: Patients on home hemodialysis actively expressed their emotions during RPM. Negative emotions were found to have significant associations with TTD. The use of emoticons and sentimental analysis may be used as a predictive indicator for prolonged TTD.",2020,Feb,J Am Med Inform Assoc,27,2,185-193,,10.1093/jamia/ocz183,31633755,#6366,Huang 2020,"",""
Detecting adolescent depression through passive monitoring of linguistic markers in smartphone communication.,Funkhouser CJ; Trivedi E; Li LY; Helgren F; Zhang E; Sritharan A; Cherner RA; Pagliaccio D; Durham K; Kyler M; Tse TC; Buchanan SN; Allen NB; Shankman SA; Auerbach RP,"BACKGROUND: Cross sectional studies have identified linguistic correlates of major depressive disorder (MDD) in smartphone communication. However, it is unclear whether monitoring these linguistic characteristics can detect when an individual is experiencing MDD, which would facilitate timely intervention. METHODS: Approximately 1.2 million messages typed into smartphone social communication apps (e.g. texting, social media) were passively collected from 90 adolescents with a range of depression severity over a 12-month period. Sentiment (i.e. positive vs. negative valence of text), proportions of first-person singular pronouns (e.g. 'I'), and proportions of absolutist words (e.g. 'all') were computed for each message and converted to weekly aggregates temporally aligned with weekly MDD statuses obtained from retrospective interviews. Idiographic, multilevel logistic regression models tested whether within-person deviations in these linguistic features were associated with the probability of concurrently meeting threshold for MDD. RESULTS: Using more first-person singular pronouns in smartphone communication relative to one's own average was associated with higher odds of meeting threshold for MDD in the concurrent week (OR = 1.29; p = .007). Sentiment (OR = 1.07; p = .54) and use of absolutist words (OR = 0.99; p = .90) were not related to weekly MDD.

METHODS: Following its development, presented with, the Athens Emotional States Inventory (AESI) proposes the design, recording and validation of an audiovisual database for five emotional states: anger, fear, joy, sadness and neutral. The items of the AESI consist of sentences each having content indicative of the corresponding emotion. Emotional content was assessed through a survey of 40 young participants with a questionnaire following the Latin square design. The emotional sentences that were correctly identified by 85% of the participants were recorded in a soundproof room with microphones and cameras. A preliminary validation of AESI is performed through automatic emotion recognition experiments from speech. RESULTS: The resulting database contains 696 recorded utterances in Greek language by 20 native speakers and has a total duration of approximately 28 min.

Machine Learning-Based Data Mining Method for Sentiment Analysis of the Sewol Ferry Disaster's Effect on Social Stress.,Lee MJ; Lee TR; Lee SJ; Jang JS; Kim EJ,"The Sewol Ferry Disaster which took place in 16th of April, 2014, was a national level disaster in South Korea that caused severe social distress nation-wide. No research at the domestic level thus far has examined the influence of the disaster on social stress through a sentiment analysis of social media data. Data extracted from YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook were used in this study. The population was users who were randomly selected from the aforementioned social media platforms who had posted texts related to the disaster from April 2014 to March 2015. ANOVA was used for statistical comparison between negative, neutral, and positive sentiments under a 95% confidence level. For NLP-based data mining results, bar graph and word cloud analysis as well as analyses of phrases, entities, and queries were implemented. Research results showed a significantly negative sentiment on all social media platforms. This was mainly related to fundamental agents such as ex-president Park and her related political parties and politicians. YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook results showed negative sentiment in phrases (63.5, 69.4, and 58.9%, respectively), entity (81.1, 69.9, and 76.0%, respectively), and query topic (75.0, 85.4, and 75.0%, respectively). All results were statistically significant (p < 0.001). This research provides scientific evidence of the negative psychological impact of the disaster on the Korean population.

Teleconsultations between Patients and Healthcare Professionals in Primary Care in Catalonia: The Evaluation of Text Classification Algorithms Using Supervised Machine Learning.,López Seguí F; Ander Egg Aguilar R; de Maeztu G; García-Altés A; García Cuyàs F; Walsh S; Sagarra Castro M; Vidal-Alaball J,"Background: The primary care service in Catalonia has operated an asynchronous teleconsulting service between GPs and patients since 2015 (eConsulta), which has generated some 500,000 messages. New developments in big data analysis tools, particularly those involving natural language, can be used to accurately and systematically evaluate the impact of the service. Objective: The study was intended to assess the predictive potential of eConsulta messages through different combinations of vector representation of text and machine learning algorithms and to evaluate their performance. Methodology: Twenty machine learning algorithms (based on five types of algorithms and four text representation techniques) were trained using a sample of 3559 messages (169,102 words) corresponding to 2268 teleconsultations (1.57 messages per teleconsultation) in order to predict the three variables of interest (avoiding the need for a face-to-face visit, increased demand and type of use of the teleconsultation). The performance of the various combinations was measured in terms of precision, sensitivity, F-value and the ROC curve. Results: The best-trained algorithms are generally effective, proving themselves to be more robust when approximating the two binary variables ""avoiding the need of a face-to-face visit"" and ""increased demand"" (precision = 0.98 and 0.97, respectively) rather than the variable ""type of query"" (precision = 0.48). Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate a machine learning strategy for text classification using primary care teleconsultation datasets. The study illustrates the possible capacities of text analysis using artificial intelligence. The development of a robust text classification tool could be feasible by validating it with more data, making it potentially more useful for decision support for health professionals.",2020,Feb,Int J Environ Res Public Health,17,3,,,10.3390/ijerph17031093,32050435,#6404,LópezSeguí 2020,"",""
Multimodal Emotion Recognition Based on Cascaded Multichannel and Hierarchical Fusion.,Liu X; Xu Z; Huang K,"Humans express their emotions in a variety of ways, which inspires research on multimodal fusion-based emotion recognition that utilizes different modalities to achieve information complementation. However, extracting deep emotional features from different modalities and fusing them remain a challenging task. It is essential to exploit the advantages of different extraction and fusion approaches to capture the emotional information contained within and across modalities. In this paper, we present a novel multimodal emotion recognition framework called multimodal emotion recognition based on cascaded multichannel and hierarchical fusion (CMC-HF), where visual, speech, and text signals are simultaneously utilized as multimodal inputs. First, three cascaded channels based on deep learning technology perform feature extraction for the three modalities separately to enhance deeper information extraction ability within each modality and improve recognition performance. Second, an improved hierarchical fusion module is introduced to promote intermodality interactions of three modalities and further improve recognition and classification accuracy. Finally, to validate the effectiveness of the designed CMC-HF model, some experiments are conducted to evaluate two benchmark datasets, IEMOCAP and CMU-MOSI. The results show that we achieved an almost 2%∼3.2% increase in accuracy of the four classes for the IEMOCAP dataset as well as an improvement of 0.9%∼2.5% in the average class accuracy for the CMU-MOSI dataset when compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods. The ablation experimental results indicate that the cascaded feature extraction method and the hierarchical fusion method make a significant contribution to multimodal emotion recognition, suggesting that the three modalities contain deeper information interactions of both intermodality and intramodality. Hence, the proposed model has better overall performance and achieves higher recognition efficiency and better robustness.",2023,,Comput Intell Neurosci,2023,,9645611,,10.1155/2023/9645611,36643891,#6414,Liu 2023,"",""

These difficulties are generally attributed to patients' reduced ability to both communicate and understand health-related ideas as well as physicians' lack of skill in identifying those with limited HL. Understanding and identifying patients with barriers posed by lower HL to improve healthcare delivery and outcomes is an important research avenue. However, doing so using traditional methods has proven difficult and infeasible to scale.

The goal of the study is to better understand HL from a linguistic perspective and to open new research areas to enhance population management and individualized care. Specifically, this study examines HL as a function of patients' demonstrated ability to communicate health-related information to their providers via secure messages. The study develops an NLP-based HL model and validates the model by predicting patient-related events such as medical outcomes and hospitalizations. Results indicate that the developed model predicts human ratings of HL with ~80% accuracy.

Exploring Abnormal Behavior Patterns of Online Users With Emotional Eating Behavior: Topic Modeling Study.,Hwang Y; Kim HJ; Choi HJ; Lee J,"BACKGROUND: Emotional eating (EE) is one of the most significant symptoms of various eating disorders. It has been difficult to collect a large amount of behavioral data on EE; therefore, only partial studies of this symptom have been conducted. To provide adequate support for online social media users with symptoms of EE, we must understand their behavior patterns to design a sophisticated personalized support system (PSS). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze the behavior patterns of emotional eaters as the first step to designing a personalized intervention system. METHODS: The machine learning (ML) framework and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling tool were used to collect and analyze behavioral data on EE. Data from a subcommunity of Reddit, /r/loseit, were analyzed. This dataset included all posts and feedback from July 2014 to May 2018, comprising 185,950 posts and 3,528,107 comments. In addition, deleted and improperly collected data were eliminated. Stochastic gradient descent-based ML classifier with an accuracy of 90.64% was developed to collect refined behavioral data of online users with EE behaviors. The expert group that labeled the dataset to train the ML classifiers included a medical doctor specializing in EE diagnosis and a nutritionist with profound knowledge of EE behavior. The experts labeled 5126 posts as EE (coded as 1) or others (coded as 0). Finally, the topic modeling process was conducted with LDA. RESULTS: The following 4 macroperspective topics of online EE behaviors were identified through linguistic evidence regarding each topic: addressing feelings, sharing physical changes, sharing and asking for dietary information, and sharing dietary strategies. The 5 main topics of feedback were dietary information, compliments, consolation, automatic bot feedback, and health information. The feedback topic distribution significantly differed depending on the type of EE behavior (overall P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study introduces a data-driven approach for analyzing behavior patterns of social website users with EE behaviors.

METHODS: The Elena+ app functions as a single-arm interventional study, with participants recruited predominantly via social media. We used paired samples T-tests and within subjects ANOVA to examine changes in health outcome assessments and user experience evaluations over time. To investigate the mediating role of behavioral activation (i.e., users setting behavioral intentions and reporting actual behaviors) we use mixed-effect regression models. Free-text entries were analyzed qualitatively. RESULTS: Results show strong demand for publicly available lifestyle coaching during the pandemic, with total downloads (N = 7'135) and 55.8% of downloaders opening the app (n = 3,928) with 9.8% completing at least one subtopic (n = 698). Greatest areas of health vulnerability as assessed with screening measures were physical activity with 62% (n = 1,000) and anxiety with 46.5% (n = 760). The app was effective in the treatment of mental health; with a significant decrease in depression between first (14 days), second (28 days), and third (42 days) assessments: F(2,38) = 7.01, p = 0.003, with a large effect size (η2G = 0.14), and anxiety between first and second assessments: t(54) = 3.7, p = <0.001 with a medium effect size (Cohen d = 0.499). Those that followed the coaching program increased in net promoter score between the first and second assessment: t(36) = 2.08, p = 0.045 with a small to medium effect size (Cohen d = 0.342). Mediation analyses showed that while increasing number of subtopics completed increased behavioral activation (i.e., match between behavioral intentions and self-reported actual behaviors), behavioral activation did not mediate the relationship to improvements in health outcome assessments. CONCLUSIONS: Findings show that: (i) there is public demand for chatbot led digital coaching, (ii) such tools can be effective in delivering treatment success, and (iii) they are highly valued by their long-term user base.

The Evaluation of a Clinical Decision Support Tool Using Natural Language Processing to Screen Hospitalized Adults for Unhealthy Substance Use: Protocol for a Quasi-Experimental Design.,Joyce C; Markossian TW; Nikolaides J; Ramsey E; Thompson HM; Rojas JC; Sharma B; Dligach D; Oguss MK; Cooper RS; Afshar M,"BACKGROUND: Automated and data-driven methods for screening using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning may replace resource-intensive manual approaches in the usual care of patients hospitalized with conditions related to unhealthy substance use. The rigorous evaluation of tools that use artificial intelligence (AI) is necessary to demonstrate effectiveness before system-wide implementation. An NLP tool to use routinely collected data in the electronic health record was previously validated for diagnostic accuracy in a retrospective study for screening unhealthy substance use. Our next step is a noninferiority design incorporated into a research protocol for clinical implementation with prospective evaluation of clinical effectiveness in a large health system. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to provide a study protocol to evaluate health outcomes and the costs and benefits of an AI-driven automated screener compared to manual human screening for unhealthy substance use. METHODS: A pre-post design is proposed to evaluate 12 months of manual screening followed by 12 months of automated screening across surgical and medical wards at a single medical center. The preintervention period consists of usual care with manual screening by nurses and social workers and referrals to a multidisciplinary Substance Use Intervention Team (SUIT). Facilitated by a NLP pipeline in the postintervention period, clinical notes from the first 24 hours of hospitalization will be processed and scored by a machine learning model, and the SUIT will be similarly alerted to patients who flagged positive for substance misuse. Flowsheets within the electronic health record have been updated to capture rates of interventions for the primary outcome (brief intervention/motivational interviewing, medication-assisted treatment, naloxone dispensing, and referral to outpatient care). Effectiveness in terms of patient outcomes will be determined by noninferior rates of interventions (primary outcome), as well as rates of readmission within 6 months, average time to consult, and discharge rates against medical advice (secondary outcomes) in the postintervention period by a SUIT compared to the preintervention period. A separate analysis will be performed to assess the costs and benefits to the health system by using automated screening. Changes from the pre- to postintervention period will be assessed in covariate-adjusted generalized linear mixed-effects models. RESULTS: The study will begin in September 2022. Monthly data monitoring and Data Safety Monitoring Board reporting are scheduled every 6 months throughout the study period. We anticipate reporting final results by June 2025. CONCLUSIONS: The use of augmented intelligence for clinical decision support is growing with an increasing number of AI tools.

Circumstantial variables preceding firearm suicide among females with and without mobility disability in the USA: comparative analysis using data from the National Violent Death Reporting System.,Takagi-Stewart J; Prater LC; Marts E; Ayachit P; Jesus TS,"BACKGROUND: Mobility disability impacts approximately 12% of the US population; females are overrepresented among persons with mobility disability. Those with mobility disability are at increased risk of suicide compared with their non-disabled counterparts. Suicide using a firearm has increased among females in the last two decades. This study aims to describe and explore significant circumstantial variables (eg, socio-demographic, health indicators) preceding firearm suicide among females with mobility disability as compared with females without mobility disability. METHODS: This is a secondary comparative, retrospective analysis of the narrative data from the National Violent Death Reporting System Restricted Access Database. Persons with mobility disability were identified through text mining and manual review and subsequently analysed with a summative form of content analysis. Pearson/Fisher's X(2) or t-tests were used to assess differences in the circumstantial variables between those with and without mobility disabilities. RESULTS: Among female firearm suicide decedents, persons with mobility disability were more commonly older (p<0.001), identified as a homemaker (p<0.001), were perceived to be in a depressed mood before death (p<0.05), had a history of suicidal thoughts (p<0.05) and were perceived to have physical pain (p<0.001); they less commonly had relationship problems (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Females with mobility disability who die by firearm suicide may be differentiated from suicide decedents without mobility disability by age, employment status, depressive mood, relationship problems and physical pain. The significance of these variables as independent risk factors for firearm suicide may be tested with prospective study designs, which in turn may inform the development of targeted or disability-inclusive prevention strategies.",2024,Jul,Inj Prev,,,,,10.1136/ip-2023-045195,39025667,#6489,Takagi-Stewart 2024,"",""
Semantic and phonetic similarity of verbal fluency responses in early-stage psychosis.,Lundin NB; Jones MN; Myers EJ; Breier A; Minor KS,"Linguistic abnormalities can emerge early in the course of psychotic illness. Computational tools that quantify similarity of responses in standardized language-based tasks such as the verbal fluency test could efficiently characterize the nature and functional correlates of these disturbances. Participants with early-stage psychosis (n=20) and demographically matched controls without a psychiatric diagnosis (n=20) performed category and letter verbal fluency. Semantic similarity was measured via predicted context co-occurrence in a large text corpus using Word2Vec. Phonetic similarity was measured via edit distance using the VFClust tool. Responses were designated as clusters (related items) or switches (transitions to less related items) using similarity-based thresholds. Results revealed that participants with early-stage psychosis compared to controls had lower fluency scores, lower cluster-related semantic similarity, and fewer switches; mean cluster size and phonetic similarity did not differ by group. Lower fluency semantic similarity was correlated with greater speech disorganization (Communication Disturbances Index), although more strongly in controls, and correlated with poorer social functioning (Global Functioning: Social), primarily in the psychosis group. Findings suggest that search for semantically related words may be impaired soon after psychosis onset. Future work is warranted to investigate the impact of language disturbances on social functioning over the course of psychotic illness.",2022,Mar,Psychiatry Res,309,,114404,,10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114404,35066310,#6492,Lundin 2022,"",""
Differentiating weight-restored anorexia nervosa and body dysmorphic disorder using neuroimaging and psychometric markers.,Vaughn DA; Kerr WT; Moody TD; Cheng GK; Morfini F; Zhang A; Leow AD; Strober MA; Cohen MS; Feusner JD,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) and body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) are potentially life-threatening conditions whose partially overlapping phenomenology-distorted perception of appearance, obsessions/compulsions, and limited insight-can make diagnostic distinction difficult in some cases. Accurate diagnosis is crucial, as the effective treatments for AN and BDD differ. To improve diagnostic accuracy and clarify the contributions of each of the multiple underlying factors, we developed a two-stage machine learning model that uses multimodal, neurobiology-based, and symptom-based quantitative data as features: task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging data using body visual stimuli, graph theory metrics of white matter connectivity from diffusor tensor imaging, and anxiety, depression, and insight psychometric scores. In a sample of unmedicated adults with BDD (n = 29), unmedicated adults with weight-restored AN (n = 24), and healthy controls (n = 31), the resulting model labeled individuals with an accuracy of 76%, significantly better than the chance accuracy of 35% ([Formula: see text]). In the multivariate model, reduced white matter global efficiency and better insight were associated more with AN than with BDD. These results improve our understanding of the relative contributions of the neurobiological characteristics and symptoms of these disorders.

Deep learning-based dimensional emotion recognition for conversational agent-based cognitive behavioral therapy.,Striegl J; Richter JW; Grossmann L; Bråstad B; Gotthardt M; Rück C; Wallert J; Loitsch C,"Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) offers a scalable, cost-effective, accessible, and low-threshold form of psychotherapy. Recent advancements explored the use of conversational agents such as chatbots and voice assistants to enhance the delivery of iCBT. These agents can deliver iCBT-based exercises, recognize and track emotional states, assess therapy progress, convey empathy, and potentially predict long-term therapy outcome. However, existing systems predominantly utilize categorical approaches for emotional modeling, which can oversimplify the complexity of human emotional states. To address this, we developed a transformer-based model for dimensional text-based emotion recognition, fine-tuned with a novel, comprehensive dimensional emotion dataset comprising 75,503 samples. This model significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in detecting the dimensions of valence, arousal, and dominance, achieving a Pearson correlation coefficient of r = 0.90, r = 0.77, and r = 0.64, respectively.

Estimating geographic subjective well-being from Twitter: A comparison of dictionary and data-driven language methods.,Jaidka K; Giorgi S; Schwartz HA; Kern ML; Ungar LH; Eichstaedt JC,"Researchers and policy makers worldwide are interested in measuring the subjective well-being of populations. When users post on social media, they leave behind digital traces that reflect their thoughts and feelings. Aggregation of such digital traces may make it possible to monitor well-being at large scale. However, social media-based methods need to be robust to regional effects if they are to produce reliable estimates. Using a sample of 1.53 billion geotagged English tweets, we provide a systematic evaluation of word-level and data-driven methods for text analysis for generating well-being estimates for 1,208 US counties. We compared Twitter-based county-level estimates with well-being measurements provided by the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index survey through 1.73 million phone surveys. We find that word-level methods (e.g., Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count [LIWC] 2015 and Language Assessment by Mechanical Turk [LabMT]) yielded inconsistent county-level well-being measurements due to regional, cultural, and socioeconomic differences in language use. However, removing as few as three of the most frequent words led to notable improvements in well-being prediction. Data-driven methods provided robust estimates, approximating the Gallup data at up to r = 0.64. We show that the findings generalized to county socioeconomic and health outcomes and were robust when poststratifying the samples to be more representative of the general US population.

Data from North American and UK participants (N = 1,151) revealed that both abstract and concrete construals significantly contribute to wise reasoning, even when controlling for a host of relevant covariates and potential response bias. Natural language processing of unstructured texts among high (top 25%) and low (bottom 25%) wisdom participants corroborated these results: semantic networks of the high wisdom group reveal greater use of both abstract and concrete themes compared to the low wisdom group.

Analysing Deception in Witness Memory through Linguistic Styles in Spontaneous Language.,Solà-Sales S; Alzetta C; Moret-Tatay C; Dell'Orletta F,"The act of lying and its detection have raised interest in many fields, from the legal system to our daily lives. Considering that testimonies are commonly based on linguistic parameters, natural language processing, a research field concerned with programming computers to process and analyse natural language texts or speech, is a topic of interest on this front. This study aimed to examine the linguistic styles of simulated deception and true testimonies collected with the aim of studying witness memory. Study participants were asked to act as a witness of a crime by retelling the story they had just read. Cognitive interviewing techniques were used to collect testimony under two conditions: truth and simulated deception. A sample of 48 participants volunteered to participate in the study. Analyses of the linguistic indicators and content were carried out. Specifically, we performed a comparison of testimonies of the same participant by condition to analyse the variation between (i) lexical and (ii) linguistic features and (iii) content and speech characteristics (disfluencies) depending on the narrative condition. Concerning lexical properties, adjectives were the most-varying grammatical category between truthful and deceptive testimonies. Furthermore, in the linguistic analysis, we observed that truthful testimonies were generally longer than deceptive ones in terms of the number of words and sentences and also characterised by more articulated sentence structures, and these differences were also statistically significant. Regarding the analysis of the content, cognitive criteria (details) and admitting lack of memory were more present in truthful statements. By providing an objective measure, these results are of interest in developing NLP tools for assessing the credibility of testimonies in forensics.",2023,Feb,Brain Sci,13,2,,,10.3390/brainsci13020317,36831859,#6579,Solà-Sales 2023,"",""
General practice recording of adverse childhood experiences: a retrospective cohort study of GP records.,Williamson AE; McQueenie R; Ellis DA; McConnachie A; Wilson P,"BACKGROUND: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are linked to negative health outcomes in adulthood. Poor engagement with services may, in part, mediate the association between adverse outcomes and ACEs. While appointment recording is comprehensive, it is not yet known if or how ACEs are recorded in the GP clinical record (GPR). AIM: To investigate recording of ACEs in the GPR and assess associations between available ACE-related Read codes and missed appointments. DESIGN & SETTING: Retrospective cohort study of 824 374 anonymised GPRs. Nationally representative sample of 136 Scottish general practices; data collected 2013-2016. METHOD: Read codes were mapped onto ACE questionnaire and wider ACE-related domains. Natural language processing (NLP) was used to augment capture of non-Read-coded ACEs. Frequency counts and proportions of mapped codes, and associations of these with defined levels of missing GP appointments, are reported. RESULTS: In total, 0.4% of patients had a record of any code that mapped onto the ACE questionnaire, contrasting with survey-reported rates of 47% in population samples. This increased only modestly by including inferred ACEs that related to safeguarding children concerns, wider aspects of ACEs, and adult consequences of ACEs. Augmentation via NLP did not substantially increase capture. Despite poor recording, there was an association between ever having an ACE code recorded and higher rates of missing GP appointments. CONCLUSION: General practices would require substantial support to implement the recording of ACEs in the GPR. This study adds to the evidence that patients who often miss appointments are more likely to be socially vulnerable.",2020,,BJGP Open,4,1,,,10.3399/bjgpopen20X101011,32071039,#6582,Williamson 2020,"",""
Identification and Classification of Depressed Mental State for End-User over Social Media.,Kumar A; Thakare A; Bhende M; Sinha AK; Alguno AC; Kumar YP,"In researching social network data and depression, it is often necessary to manually label depressed and non-depressed users, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. The aim of this study is that it explores the relationship between social network data and depression. It can also contribute to detecting and identifying depression. Through collecting and analyzing college students' microblog social data, a preliminary screening algorithm for college students' suspected depression microblogs based on depression keywords, and semantic expansion is researched; a comprehensive lexical grammar was proposed. This research provided has a preliminary screening method based on depression keywords and semantic expansion for college students' suspected depression microblogs, with a screening accuracy.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the possibility of systematically scanning intelligence from media that are usually not captured or best gathered through structured academic channels and inform on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health workforce, contributing factors to the pervasiveness of the impacts, and policy responses, as depicted in publicly available news articles. Our focus was to investigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and, concurrently, assess the feasibility of gathering health workforce insights from open sources rapidly. METHODS: We conducted an NLP-assisted media content analysis of open-source news coverage on the COVID-19 pandemic published between January 2020 and June 2022. A data set of 3,299,158 English news articles on the COVID-19 pandemic was extracted from the World Health Organization Epidemic Intelligence through Open Sources (EIOS) system. The data preparation phase included developing rules-based classification, fine-tuning an NLP summarization model, and further data processing. Following relevancy evaluation, a deductive-inductive approach was used for the analysis of the summarizations. This included data extraction, inductive coding, and theme grouping. RESULTS: After processing and classifying the initial data set comprising 3,299,158 news articles and reports, a data set of 5131 articles with 3,007,693 words was devised. The NLP summarization model allowed for a reduction in the length of each article resulting in 496,209 words that facilitated agile analysis performed by humans. Media content analysis yielded results in 3 sections: areas of COVID-19 impacts and their pervasiveness, contributing factors to COVID-19-related impacts, and responses to the impacts.

Explainable online health information truthfulness in Consumer Health Search.,Upadhyay R; Knoth P; Pasi G; Viviani M,"INTRODUCTION: People are today increasingly relying on health information they find online to make decisions that may impact both their physical and mental wellbeing. Therefore, there is a growing need for systems that can assess the truthfulness of such health information. Most of the current literature solutions use machine learning or knowledge-based approaches treating the problem as a binary classification task, discriminating between correct information and misinformation. Such solutions present several problems with regard to user decision making, among which: (i) the binary classification task provides users with just two predetermined possibilities with respect to the truthfulness of the information, which users should take for granted; indeed, (ii) the processes by which the results were obtained are often opaque and the results themselves have little or no interpretation. METHODS: To address these issues, we approach the problem as an ad hoc retrieval task rather than a classification task, with reference, in particular, to the Consumer Health Search task. To do this, a previously proposed Information Retrieval model, which considers information truthfulness as a dimension of relevance, is used to obtain a ranked list of both topically-relevant and truthful documents. The novelty of this work concerns the extension of such a model with a solution for the explainability of the results obtained, by relying on a knowledge base consisting of scientific evidence in the form of medical journal articles. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We evaluate the proposed solution both quantitatively, as a standard classification task, and qualitatively, through a user study to examine the ""explained"" ranked list of documents. The results obtained illustrate the solution's effectiveness and usefulness in making the retrieved results more interpretable by Consumer Health Searchers, both with respect to topical relevance and truthfulness.",2023,,Front Artif Intell,6,,1184851,,10.3389/frai.2023.1184851,37415938,#6600,Upadhyay 2023,"",""

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this project was to use enhanced automated regular feedback of information from electronic health records to improve the quality of antipsychotic prescribing and monitoring in people with dementia. METHODS: The South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLaM) incorporated antipsychotic monitoring forms into its electronic health records. The SLaM Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) platform provides researcher access to de-identified health records, and natural language processing is used in CRIS to derive structured data from unstructured free text, including recorded diagnoses and medication. Algorithms were thus developed to ascertain patients with dementia receiving antipsychotic treatment and to determine whether monitoring forms had been completed. We used two improvement plan-do-study-act cycles to improve the accuracy of the algorithm for automated evaluation and provided monthly feedback on team performance. RESULTS: A steady increase in antipsychotic monitoring form completion was observed across the study period. The percentage of our sample with a completed antipsychotic monitoring form more than doubled from October 2017 (22%) to January 2019 (58%).

These data are suggested as markers for the mental state of patients with bipolar disorder (BD). OBJECTIVE: We assessed the relations between data collected from smartphones and the clinically rated depressive and manic symptoms together with the corresponding affective states in patients with BD. METHODS: BDmon, a dedicated mobile app, was developed and installed on patients' smartphones to automatically collect the statistics about their phone calls and text messages as well as their self-assessments of sleep and mood. The final sample for the numerical analyses consisted of 51 eligible patients who participated in at least two psychiatric assessments and used the BDmon app (mean participation time, 208 [SD 132] days).

Generalized linear mixed-effects models were applied to quantify the strength of the relation between the daily statistics on the behavioral data collected automatically from smartphones and the affective symptoms and mood states in patients with BD. RESULTS: Objective behavioral data collected from smartphones were found to be related with the BD states as follows: (1) depressed patients tended to make phone calls less frequently than euthymic patients (β=-.064, P=.01); (2) the number of incoming answered calls during depression was lower than that during euthymia (β=-.15, P=.01) and, concurrently, missed incoming calls were more frequent and increased as depressive symptoms intensified (β=4.431, P<.001; β=4.861, P<.001, respectively); (3) the fraction of outgoing calls was higher in manic states (β=2.73, P=.03); (4) the fraction of missed calls was higher in manic/mixed states as compared to that in the euthymic state (β=3.53, P=.01) and positively correlated to the severity of symptoms (β=2.991, P=.02); (5) the variability of the duration of the outgoing calls was higher in manic/mixed states (β=.0012, P=.045) and positively correlated to the severity of symptoms (β=.0017, P=.02); and (6) the number and length of the sent text messages was higher in manic/mixed states as compared to that in the euthymic state (β=.031, P=.01; β=.015, P=.01; respectively) and positively correlated to the severity of manic symptoms (β=.116, P<.001; β=.022, P<.001; respectively).

Prediction Rules Identify Which Young Adults Have Higher Rates of Heavy Episodic Drinking After Exposure to 12-Week Text Message Interventions.,Chung T; Suffoletto B; Feldstein Ewing SW; Bhurosy T; Jiang Y; Valera P,"BACKGROUND: An alcohol text message intervention recently demonstrated effects in reducing heavy episodic drinking (HED) days at the three month follow-up in young adults with a history of hazardous drinking. An important next step in understanding intervention effects involves identifying baseline participant characteristics that predict who will benefit from intervention exposure to support clinical decision-making and guide further intervention development. To identify baseline characteristics that predict HED, this exploratory study used a prediction rule ensemble (PRE). Compared to more complex decision-tree methods (e.g., random forest), PREs have comparable performance, while generating simpler rules that can directly identify subgroups that do or do not respond to intervention. METHODS: This secondary analysis examined data from 916 young adults who reported HED (68.5% female, mean age = 22.1, SD = 2.1), were enrolled in an alcohol text message randomized clinical trial and who completed baseline assessment and the three month follow-up. A PRE with ten fold cross-validation, which included 21 baseline variables representing sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., sex, age, race, ethnicity, college enrollment), alcohol consumption (frequency of alcohol consumption, quantity consumed on a typical drinking day, frequency of HED), impulsivity subscales (i.e., negative urgency, positive urgency, lack of premeditation, lack of perseverance, sensation seeking), readiness to change, perceived peer drinking and HED-related consequences, and intervention status were used to predict HED at the three month follow-up. RESULTS: The PRE identified 12 rules that predicted HED at three months (R(2) = 0.23) using 7 baseline features. Only two cases (0.2%) were not classified by the 12 rules. The most important features for predicting three month HED included baseline alcohol consumption, negative urgency score, and perceived peer drinking.

AI Hesitancy and Acceptability-Perceptions of AI Chatbots for Chronic Health Management and Long COVID Support: Survey Study.,Wu PF; Summers C; Panesar A; Kaura A; Zhang L,"BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots have the potential to assist individuals with chronic health conditions by providing tailored information, monitoring symptoms, and offering mental health support. Despite their potential benefits, research on public attitudes toward health care chatbots is still limited. To effectively support individuals with long-term health conditions like long COVID (or post-COVID-19 condition), it is crucial to understand their perspectives and preferences regarding the use of AI chatbots. OBJECTIVE: This study has two main objectives: (1) provide insights into AI chatbot acceptance among people with chronic health conditions, particularly adults older than 55 years and (2) explore the perceptions of using AI chatbots for health self-management and long COVID support. METHODS: A web-based survey study was conducted between January and March 2023, specifically targeting individuals with diabetes and other chronic conditions. This particular population was chosen due to their potential awareness and ability to self-manage their condition. The survey aimed to capture data at multiple intervals, taking into consideration the public launch of ChatGPT, which could have potentially impacted public opinions during the project timeline. The survey received 1310 clicks and garnered 900 responses, resulting in a total of 888 usable data points. RESULTS: Although past experience with chatbots (P<.001, 95% CI .110-.302) and online information seeking (P<.001, 95% CI .039-.084) are strong indicators of respondents' future adoption of health chatbots, they are in general skeptical or unsure about the use of AI chatbots for health care purposes. Less than one-third of the respondents (n=203, 30.1%) indicated that they were likely to use a health chatbot in the next 12 months if available. Most were uncertain about a chatbot's capability to provide accurate medical advice. However, people seemed more receptive to using voice-based chatbots for mental well-being, health data collection, and analysis. Half of the respondents with long COVID showed interest in using emotionally intelligent chatbots. CONCLUSIONS: AI hesitancy is not uniform across all health domains and user groups. Despite persistent AI hesitancy, there are promising opportunities for chatbots to offer support for chronic conditions in areas of lifestyle enhancement and mental well-being, potentially through voice-based user interfaces.",2024,Jul,JMIR Hum Factors,11,,e51086,,10.2196/51086,39045815,#6668,Wu 2024,"",""
INFERRING CLINICAL DEPRESSION FROM SPEECH AND SPOKEN UTTERANCES.,Asgari M; Shafran I; Sheeber LB,"In this paper, we investigate the problem of detecting depression from recordings of subjects' speech using speech processing and machine learning. There has been considerable interest in this problem in recent years due to the potential for developing objective assessments from real-world behaviors, which may provide valuable supplementary clinical information or may be useful in screening. The cues for depression may be present in ""what is said"" (content) and ""how it is said"" (prosody). Given the limited amounts of text data, even in this relatively large study, it is difficult to employ standard method of learning models from n-gram features. Instead, we learn models using word representations in an alternative feature space of valence and arousal. This is akin to embedding words into a real vector space albeit with manual ratings instead of those learned with deep neural networks [1]. For extracting prosody, we employ standard feature extractors such as those implemented in openSMILE and compare them with features extracted from harmonic models that we have been developing in recent years. Our experiments show that our features from harmonic model improve the performance of detecting depression from spoken utterances than other alternatives. The context features provide additional improvements to achieve an accuracy of about 74%, sufficient to be useful in screening applications.",2014,Sep,IEEE Int Workshop Mach Learn Signal Process,2014,,,,10.1109/mlsp.2014.6958856,33288990,#6676,Asgari 2014,"",""
"Specific associations of passively sensed smartphone data with future symptoms of avoidance, fear, and physiological distress in social anxiety.",Stamatis CA; Liu T; Meyerhoff J; Meng Y; Cho YM; Karr CJ; Curtis BL; Ungar LH; Mohr DC,"BACKGROUND: Prior literature links passively sensed information about a person's location, movement, and communication with social anxiety. These findings hold promise for identifying novel treatment targets, informing clinical care, and personalizing digital mental health interventions. However, social anxiety symptoms are heterogeneous; to identify more precise targets and tailor treatments, there is a need for personal sensing studies aimed at understanding differential predictors of the distinct subdomains of social anxiety. Our objective was to conduct a large-scale smartphone-based sensing study of fear, avoidance, and physiological symptoms in the context of trait social anxiety over time. METHODS: Participants (n = 1013; 74.6 % female; M age = 40.9) downloaded the LifeSense app, which collected continuous passive data (e.g., GPS, communication, app and device use) over 16 weeks. We tested a series of multilevel linear regression models to understand within- and between-person associations of 2-week windows of passively sensed smartphone data with fear, avoidance, and physiological distress on the self-reported Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN). A shifting sensor lag was applied to examine how smartphone features related to SPIN subdomains 2 weeks in the future (distal prediction), 1 week in the future (medial prediction), and 0 weeks in the future (proximal prediction). RESULTS: A decrease in time visiting novel places was a strong between-person predictor of social avoidance over time (distal β = -0.886, p = .002; medial β = -0.647, p = .029; proximal β = -0.818, p = .007). Reductions in call- and text-based communications were associated with social avoidance at both the between- (distal β = -0.882, p = .002; medial β = -0.932, p = .001; proximal β = -0.918, p = .001) and within- (distal β = -0.191, p = .046; medial β = -0.213, p = .028) person levels, as well as between-person fear of social situations (distal β = -0.860, p < .001; medial β = -0.892, p < .001; proximal β = -0.886, p < .001) over time. There were fewer significant associations of sensed data with physiological distress. Across the three subscales, smartphone data explained 9-12 % of the variance in social anxiety. CONCLUSION: Findings have implications for understanding how social anxiety manifests in daily life, and for personalizing treatments. For example, a signal that someone is likely to begin avoiding social situations may suggest a need for alternative types of exposure-based interventions compared to a signal that someone is likely to begin experiencing increased physiological distress. Our results suggest that as a prophylactic means of targeting social avoidance, it may be helpful to deploy interventions involving social exposures in response to decreases in time spent visiting novel places.",2023,Dec,Internet Interv,34,,100683,,10.1016/j.invent.2023.100683,37867614,#6681,Stamatis 2023,"",""
Online discourse on fibromyalgia: text-mining to identify clinical distinction and patient concerns.,Park J; Ryu YU,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the possibility of using text-mining to identify clinical distinctions and patient concerns in online memoires posted by patients with fibromyalgia (FM). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 399 memoirs were collected from an FM group website. The unstructured data of memoirs associated with FM were collected through a crawling process and converted into structured data with a concordance, parts of speech tagging, and word frequency. We also conducted a lexical analysis and phrase pattern identification. After examining the data, a set of FM-related keywords were obtained and phrase net relationships were set through a web-based visualization tool. RESULTS: The clinical distinction of FM was verified. Pain is the biggest issue to the FM patients. The pains were affecting body parts including 'muscles,' 'leg,' 'neck,' 'back,' 'joints,' and 'shoulders' with accompanying symptoms such as 'spasms,' 'stiffness,' and 'aching,' and were described as 'sever,' 'chronic,' and 'constant.' This study also demonstrated that it was possible to understand the interests and concerns of FM patients through text-mining. FM patients wanted to escape from the pain and symptoms, so they were interested in medical treatment and help. Also, they seemed to have interest in their work and occupation, and hope to continue to live life through the relationships with the people around them. CONCLUSIONS: This research shows the potential for extracting keywords to confirm the clinical distinction of a certain disease, and text-mining can help objectively understand the concerns of patients by generalizing their large number of subjective illness experiences. However, it is believed that there are limitations to the processes and methods for organizing and classifying large amounts of text, so these limits have to be considered when analyzing the results. The development of research methodology to overcome these limitations is greatly needed.",2014,Oct,Med Sci Monit,20,,1858-64,,10.12659/MSM.890793,25287854,#6688,Park 2014,"",""
A Deep Quantum Convolutional Neural Network Based Facial Expression Recognition For Mental Health Analysis.,Hossain S; Umer S; Rout RK; Marzouqi HA,"The purpose of this work is to analyze how new technologies can enhance clinical practice while also examining the physical traits of emotional expressiveness of face expression in a number of psychiatric illnesses. Hence, in this work, an automatic facial expression recognition system has been proposed that analyzes static, sequential, or video facial images from medical healthcare data to detect emotions in people's facial regions. The proposed method has been implemented in five steps. The first step is image preprocessing, where a facial region of interest has been segmented from the input image. The second component includes a classical deep feature representation and the quantum part that involves successive sets of quantum convolutional layers followed by random quantum variational circuits for feature learning. Here, the proposed system has attained a faster training approach using the proposed quantum convolutional neural network approach that takes [Formula: see text] time. In contrast, the classical convolutional neural network models have [Formula: see text] time. Additionally, some performance improvement techniques, such as image augmentation, fine-tuning, matrix normalization, and transfer learning methods, have been applied to the recognition system. Finally, the scores due to classical and quantum deep learning models are fused to improve the performance of the proposed method.

Life priorities in the HIV-positive Asians: a text-mining analysis in young vs. old generation.,Chen WT; Barbour R,"HIV/AIDS is one of the most urgent and challenging public health issues, especially since it is now considered a chronic disease. In this project, we used text mining techniques to extract meaningful words and word patterns from 45 transcribed in-depth interviews of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) conducted in Taipei, Beijing, Shanghai, and San Francisco from 2006 to 2013. Text mining analysis can predict whether an emerging field will become a long-lasting source of academic interest or whether it is simply a passing source of interest that will soon disappear. The data were analyzed by age group (45 and older vs. 44 and younger).

Participants in the 44-year-old and younger group were focused mainly on disease disclosure, their families, and their financial condition. In older PLWHA, social supports were one of the main concerns. In this study, we learned that different age groups perceive the disease differently.

LGCCT: A Light Gated and Crossed Complementation Transformer for Multimodal Speech Emotion Recognition.,Liu F; Shen SY; Fu ZW; Wang HY; Zhou AM; Qi JY,"Semantic-rich speech emotion recognition has a high degree of popularity in a range of areas. Speech emotion recognition aims to recognize human emotional states from utterances containing both acoustic and linguistic information. Since both textual and audio patterns play essential roles in speech emotion recognition (SER) tasks, various works have proposed novel modality fusing methods to exploit text and audio signals effectively. However, most of the high performance of existing models is dependent on a great number of learnable parameters, and they can only work well on data with fixed length. Therefore, minimizing computational overhead and improving generalization to unseen data with various lengths while maintaining a certain level of recognition accuracy is an urgent application problem. In this paper, we propose LGCCT, a light gated and crossed complementation transformer for multimodal speech emotion recognition. First, our model is capable of fusing modality information efficiently. Specifically, the acoustic features are extracted by CNN-BiLSTM while the textual features are extracted by BiLSTM. The modality-fused representation is then generated by the cross-attention module. We apply the gate-control mechanism to achieve the balanced integration of the original modality representation and the modality-fused representation. Second, the degree of attention focus can be considered, as the uncertainty and the entropy of the same token should converge to the same value independent of the length. To improve the generalization of the model to various testing-sequence lengths, we adopt the length-scaled dot product to calculate the attention score, which can be interpreted from a theoretical view of entropy. The operation of the length-scaled dot product is cheap but effective. Experiments are conducted on the benchmark dataset CMU-MOSEI. Compared to the baseline models, our model achieves an 81.0% F1 score with only 0.432 M parameters, showing an improvement in the balance between performance and the number of parameters. Moreover, the ablation study signifies the effectiveness of our model and its scalability to various input-sequence lengths, wherein the relative improvement is almost 20% of the baseline without a length-scaled dot product.",2022,Jul,Entropy (Basel),24,7,,,10.3390/e24071010,35885233,#6700,Liu 2022,"",""

Examination of Stigmatizing Language in the Electronic Health Record.,Himmelstein G; Bates D; Zhou L,"IMPORTANCE: Stigmatizing language in the electronic health record (EHR) may alter treatment plans, transmit biases between clinicians, and alienate patients. However, neither the frequency of stigmatizing language in hospital notes, nor whether clinicians disproportionately use it in describing patients in particular demographic subgroups are known. OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence of stigmatizing language in hospital admission notes and the patient and clinician characteristics associated with the use of such language. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study of admission notes used natural language processing on 48 651 admission notes written about 29 783 unique patients by 1932 clinicians at a large, urban academic medical center between January to December 2018. The admission notes included 8738 notes about 4309 patients with diabetes written by 1204 clinicians; 6197 notes about 3058 patients with substance use disorder by 1132 clinicians; and 5176 notes about 2331 patients with chronic pain by 1056 clinicians. Statistical analyses were performed between May and September 2021. EXPOSURES: Patients' demographic characteristics (age, race and ethnicity, gender, and preferred language); clinicians' characteristics (gender, postgraduate year [PGY], and credential [physician vs advanced practice clinician]). MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Binary indicator for any vs no stigmatizing language; frequencies of specific stigmatizing words. Linear probability models were the main measure, and logistic regression and odds ratios were used for sensitivity analyses and further exploration. RESULTS: The sample included notes on 29 783 patients with a mean (SD) age of 46.9 (27.6) years. Of these patients, 1033 (3.5%) were non-Hispanic Asian, 2498 (8.4%) were non-Hispanic Black, 18 956 (63.6%) were non-Hispanic White, 17 334 (58.2%) were female, and 2939 (9.9%) preferred a language other than English. Of all admission notes, 1197 (2.5%) contained stigmatizing language. The diagnosis-specific stigmatizing language was present in 599 notes (6.9%) for patients with diabetes, 209 (3.4%) for patients with substance use disorders, and 37 (0.7%) for patients with chronic pain. In the whole sample, notes about non-Hispanic Black patients vs non-Hispanic White patients had a 0.67 (95% CI, 0.15 to 1.18) percentage points greater probability of containing stigmatizing language, with similar disparities in all 3 diagnosis-specific subgroups. Greater diabetes severity and the physician-author being less advanced in their training was associated with more stigmatizing language. A 1 point increase in the diabetes severity index was associated with a 1.23 (95% CI, .23 to 2.23) percentage point greater probability of a note containing stigmatizing language. In the sample restricted to physicians, a higher PGY was associated with less use of stigmatizing language overall (-0.05 percentage points/PGY [95% CI, -0.09 to -0.01]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, stigmatizing language in hospital notes varied by medical condition and was more often used to describe non-Hispanic Black patients.

Daily levels of collective anxiety and positive emotions were estimated using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count's (LIWC) psychologically validated lexicon. The time series estimates of the two collective emotions were analyzed for structural breaks, which mark a significant change in a series due to an external shock. External shocks to collective emotions come from events that are of shared emotional relevance, and this study develops a new approach to identifying them. In the COVID-19 Twitter posts used in the study, analysis of structural breaks showed that in all 16 countries, a reduction in collective anxiety and an increase in positive emotions followed the WHO's declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Announcements of economic support packages and social restrictions also had similar impacts in some countries.

Though comorbidity increases the risk of adverse outcomes and mortality, most clinical interventions target these diseases separately. Increasing physical activity might be effective to simultaneously lower depressive symptoms and improve glycaemic control. Self-management apps are a cost-effective, scalable and easy access treatment to increase physical activity. However, cutting-edge technological applications often do not reach vulnerable populations and are not tailored to an individual's behaviour and characteristics. Tailoring of interventions using machine learning methods likely increases the effectiveness of the intervention. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In a three-arm randomised controlled trial, we will examine the effect of a text-messaging smartphone application to encourage physical activity in low-income ethnic minority patients with comorbid diabetes and depression. The adaptive intervention group receives messages chosen from different messaging banks by a reinforcement learning algorithm. The uniform random intervention group receives the same messages, but chosen from the messaging banks with equal probabilities. The control group receives a weekly mood message. We aim to recruit 276 adults from primary care clinics aged 18-75 years who have been diagnosed with current diabetes and show elevated depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale-8 (PHQ-8) >5). We will compare passively collected daily step counts, self-report PHQ-8 and most recent haemoglobin A1c from medical records at baseline and at intervention completion at 6-month follow-up.

However, the positive emotional expressions, like self-confidence, optimism, and praise, that appear in Chinese social networks are rarely explored by researchers. This study aims to analyze the characteristics of netizens' positive energy expressions and the impact of node events on public emotional expression during the COVID-19 pandemic. First, a total of 6,525,249 Chinese texts posted by Sina Weibo users were randomly selected through textual data cleaning and word segmentation for corpus construction. A fine-grained sentiment lexicon that contained POSITIVE ENERGY was built using Word2Vec technology; this lexicon was later used to conduct sentiment category analysis on original posts. Next, through manual labeling and multi-classification machine learning model construction, four mainstream machine learning algorithms were selected to train the emotional intensity model.

"Linguistic indicators of patient, couple, and family adjustment following breast cancer.",Robbins ML; Mehl MR; Smith HL; Weihs KL,"BACKGROUND: This study examined how language reflective of emotional and social processes during a cancer-related discussion relates to patient, couple, and family adjustment after breast cancer. It investigated whether emotional expression or relational focus, manifested in language use, indicates healthy family coping following breast cancer. METHODS: Family members each completed measures of adjustment (Family Environment Scale, Dyadic Adjustment Scale, and patient Profile of Mood States) and engaged in a 15-min family discussion about how they have coped with breast cancer. Transcripts from the discussion were submitted to a text-analysis software program to obtain frequency of positive and negative emotion words, and personal pronouns spoken by each family member. The relationship between self-reports of adjustment and frequency of language use during the family discussion was analyzed with regression models. RESULTS: Partners' positive emotion words were indicative of better family adjustment, patients' negative emotion words indicated greater family conflict, and sons' and daughters' anger words indicated poorer adjustment, whereas their anxiety words indicated better family adjustment. Partner we-talk was related to better dyadic adjustment, and couples' 'you' was somewhat related to worse adjustment at all levels. CONCLUSIONS: Important information about how a family copes with breast cancer can be obtained by attending to families' emotional and relational language. This study suggests that clinicians and members of families' support networks can gauge how well a family has adapted after the breast cancer experience by attending to the type of words that each family member uses to describe how they coped with breast cancer.",2013,Jul,Psychooncology,22,7,1501-8,,10.1002/pon.3161,22887054,#6737,Robbins 2013,"",""

A greater percentage of patients in the BED cohort were prescribed pharmacotherapy (70.6% [probable BED, 66.9%]) than received/discussed psychotherapy (53.1% [probable BED, 39.2%]) at baseline. In the BED cohort, 54.4% of patients were prescribed antidepressants (probable BED, 52.4%), 25.3% stimulants (probable BED, 20.1%), and 34.4% nonspecific psychotherapy (probable BED, 24.6%) at baseline, with no substantive differences observed during follow-up. Low percentages of patients in the BED cohort received/discussed cognitive behavioral therapy at baseline (12.5% [probable BED, 9.0%) or during follow-up (13.0% [probable BED, 8.8%). Among patients with ≥1 psychotherapy visit, the mean ± SD number of visits in the BED cohort was 1.2 ± 5.9 at baseline (probable BED, 1.7 ± 7.3) and 2.2 ± 7.7 during follow-up (probable BED, 2.6 ± 7.7).

Response Time as an Implicit Self-Schema Indicator for Depression Among Undergraduate Students: Preliminary Findings From a Mobile App-Based Depression Assessment.,Chung K; Park JY; Joung D; Jhung K,"BACKGROUND: Response times to depressive symptom items in a mobile-based depression screening instrument has potential as an implicit self-schema indicator for depression but has yet to be determined; the instrument was designed to readily record depressive symptoms experienced on a daily basis. In this study, the well-validated Korean version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-Revised (K-CESD-R) was adopted. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between depression severity (ie, explicit measure: total K-CESD-R Mobile scores) and the latent trait of interest in schematic self-referent processing of depressive symptom items (ie, implicit measure: response times to items in the K-CESD-R Mobile scale). The purpose was to investigate this relationship among undergraduate students who had never been diagnosed with, but were at risk for, major depressive disorder (MDD) or comorbid MDD with other neurological or psychiatric disorders. METHODS: A total of 70 participants-36 males (51%) and 34 females (49%)-aged 19-29 years (mean 22.66, SD 2.11), were asked to complete both mobile and standard K-CESD-R assessments via their own mobile phones. The mobile K-CESD-R sessions (binary scale: yes or no) were administered on a daily basis for 2 weeks. The standard K-CESD-R assessment (5-point scale) was administered on the final day of the 2-week study period; the assessment was delivered via text message, including a link to the survey, directly to participants' mobile phones. RESULTS: A total of 5 participants were excluded from data analysis. The result of polynomial regression analysis showed that the relationship between total K-CESD-R Mobile scores and the reaction times to the depressive symptom items was better explained by a quadratic trend-F (2, 62)=21.16, P<.001, R(2)=.41-than by a linear trend-F (1, 63)=25.43, P<.001, R(2)=.29. It was further revealed that the K-CESD-R Mobile app had excellent internal consistency (Cronbach alpha=.94); at least moderate concurrent validity with other depression scales, such as the Korean version of the Quick Inventory for Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (ρ=.38, P=.002) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (ρ=.48, P<.001); a high adherence rate for all participants (65/70, 93%); and a high follow-up rate for 10 participants whose mobile or standard K-CESD-R score was 13 or greater (8/10, 80%). CONCLUSIONS: As hypothesized, based on a self-schema model for depression that represented both item and person characteristics, the inverted U-shaped relationship between the explicit and implicit self-schema measures for depression showed the potential of an organizational breakdown; this also showed the potential for a subsequent return to efficient processing of schema-consistent information along a continuum, ranging from nondepression through mild depression to severe depression. Further, it is expected that the updated K-CESD-R Mobile app can play an important role in encouraging people at risk for depression to seek professional follow-up for mental health care.",2019,Sep,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,7,9,e14657,,10.2196/14657,31586362,#6790,Chung 2019,"",""
Inferring Opinions and Behavioral Characteristics of Gay Men with Large Scale Multilingual Text from Blued.,Huang G; Cai M; Lu X,"Gay men in many countries are increasingly using geosocial networking applications (GSN apps), thus offering new opportunities for understanding them. This paper provides a comprehensive content analysis of posts and opinions on Blued, the world's largest gay social networking dating app, to infer and compare opinions and behavioral characteristics of gay men in different countries. Machine learning and linguistic programming approaches were used to extract themes and analyze sentiments of posts. The results show that the majority of posts are related to daily life activities, and less are related to sensitive topics. While most posts are positive or neutral, negative emotions, including anxiety, anger, and sadness, are mainly distributed in posts related to self-identification and sexual behaviors in China and to relationships in other countries. Voting items indicate that only 50.52% of the participants will take regular HIV tests while 50.2% would have casual sex when they are single. Additionally, 35.8% of the participants may try drugs when invited by friends.

Machine Learning and Cloud-Based Knowledge Graphs to Recognize Suicidal Mental Tendencies.,Gunjan VK; Vijayalata Y; Valli S; Kumar S; Mohamed MO; Saravanan V,"To improve the quality of knowledge service selection in a cloud manufacturing environment, this paper proposes a cloud manufacturing knowledge service optimization decision method based on users' psychological behavior. Based on the characteristic analysis of cloud manufacturing knowledge service, establish the optimal evaluation index system of cloud manufacturing knowledge service, use the rough set theory to assign initial weights to each evaluation index, and adjust the initial weights according to the user's multiattribute preference to ensure that the consequences are allocated correctly. The system can help counselors acquire psychological knowledge in time and identify counselors with suicidal tendencies to prevent danger. This paper collected some psychological information data and built a knowledge graph by creating a dictionary and generating entities and relationships. The Han language processing word segmentation tool generates keywords, and CHI (Chi-square) feature selection is used to classify the problem. This feature selection is a statistical premise test that is acceptable when the chi-square test results are distributed with the null hypothesis. It includes the Pearson chi-square test and its variations. The Chi-square test has several benefits, including its distributed processing resilience, ease of computation, broad information gained from the test, usage in research when statistical assumptions are not satisfied, and adaptability in organizing information from multiple or many more group investigations. For improving question and answer efficiency, compared with other models, the BiLSTM (bidirectional long short-term memory) model is preferred to build suicidal tendencies. The Han language processing is a method that is used for word segmentation, and the advantage of this method is that it plays a key role in the word segmentation tool and generates keywords, and CHI (Chi-square) feature selection is used to classify the problem. Text classifier detects dangerous user utterances, question template matching, and answer generation by computing similarity scores. Finally, the system accuracy test is carried out, proving that the system can effectively answer the questions related to psychological counseling.

Measuring disorganized speech in schizophrenia: automated analysis explains variance in cognitive deficits beyond clinician-rated scales.,Minor KS; Willits JA; Marggraf MP; Jones MN; Lysaker PH,"BACKGROUND: Conveying information cohesively is an essential element of communication that is disrupted in schizophrenia. These disruptions are typically expressed through disorganized symptoms, which have been linked to neurocognitive, social cognitive, and metacognitive deficits. Automated analysis can objectively assess disorganization within sentences, between sentences, and across paragraphs by comparing explicit communication to a large text corpus. METHOD: Little work in schizophrenia has tested: (1) links between disorganized symptoms measured via automated analysis and neurocognition, social cognition, or metacognition; and (2) if automated analysis explains incremental variance in cognitive processes beyond clinician-rated scales. Disorganization was measured in schizophrenia (n = 81) with Coh-Metrix 3.0, an automated program that calculates basic and complex language indices. Trained staff also assessed neurocognition, social cognition, metacognition, and clinician-rated disorganization. RESULTS: Findings showed that all three cognitive processes were significantly associated with at least one automated index of disorganization. When automated analysis was compared with a clinician-rated scale, it accounted for significant variance in neurocognition and metacognition beyond the clinician-rated measure. When combined, these two methods explained 28-31% of the variance in neurocognition, social cognition, and metacognition. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrated how automated analysis can highlight the specific role of disorganization in neurocognition, social cognition, and metacognition. Generally, those with poor cognition also displayed more disorganization in their speech-making it difficult for listeners to process essential information needed to tie the speaker's ideas together.

Posting patterns in peer online support forums and their associations with emotions and mood in bipolar disorder: Exploratory analysis.,Jagfeld G; Lobban F; Davies R; Boyd RL; Rayson P; Jones S,"BACKGROUND: Mental health (MH) peer online forums offer robust support where internet access is common, but healthcare is not, e.g., in countries with under-resourced MH support, rural areas, and during pandemics. Despite their widespread use, little is known about who posts in such forums, and in what mood states. The discussion platform Reddit is ideally suited to study this as it hosts forums (subreddits) for MH and non-MH topics. In bipolar disorder (BD), where extreme mood states are core defining features, mood influences are particularly relevant. OBJECTIVES: This exploratory study investigated posting patterns of Reddit users with a self-reported BD diagnosis and the associations between posting and emotions, specifically: 1) What proportion of the identified users posts in MH versus non-MH subreddits? 2) What differences exist in the emotions that they express in MH or non-MH subreddit posts? 3) How does mood differ between those users who post in MH subreddits compared to those who only post in non-MH subreddits? METHODS: Reddit users were automatically identified via self-reported BD diagnosis statements and all their 2005-2019 posts were downloaded. First, the percentages of users who posted only in MH (non-MH) subreddits were calculated. Second, affective vocabulary use was compared in MH versus non-MH subreddits by measuring the frequency of words associated with positive emotions, anxiety, sadness, anger, and first-person singular pronouns via the LIWC text analysis tool. Third, a logistic regression distinguished users who did versus did not post in MH subreddits, using the same LIWC variables (measured from users' non-MH subreddit posts) as predictors, controlling for age, gender, active days, and mean posts/day. RESULTS: 1) Two thirds of the identified 19,685 users with a self-reported BD diagnosis posted in both MH and non-MH subreddits. 2) Users who posted in both MH and non-MH subreddits exhibited less positive emotion but more anxiety and sadness and used more first-person singular pronouns in their MH subreddit posts. 3) Feminine gender, higher positive emotion, anxiety, and sadness were significantly associated with posting in MH subreddits. CONCLUSIONS: Many Reddit users who disclose a BD diagnosis use a single account to discuss MH and other concerns. Future work should determine whether users exhibit more anxiety and sadness in their MH subreddit posts because they more readily post in MH subreddits when experiencing lower mood or because they feel more able to express negative emotions in these spaces. MH forums may reflect the views of people who experience more extreme mood (outside of MH subreddits) compared to people who do not post in MH subreddits. These findings can be useful for MH professionals to discuss online forums with their clients. For example, they may caution them that forums may underrepresent people living well with BD.",2023,,PLoS One,18,9,e0291369,,10.1371/journal.pone.0291369,37747891,#6907,Jagfeld 2023,"",""

Investigating Employees' Concerns and Wishes Regarding Digital Stress Management Interventions With Value Sensitive Design: Mixed Methods Study.,Kerr JI; Naegelin M; Benk M; V Wangenheim F; Meins E; Viganò E; Ferrario A,"BACKGROUND: Work stress places a heavy economic and disease burden on society. Recent technological advances include digital health interventions for helping employees prevent and manage their stress at work effectively. Although such digital solutions come with an array of ethical risks, especially if they involve biomedical big data, the incorporation of employees' values in their design and deployment has been widely overlooked. OBJECTIVE: To bridge this gap, we used the value sensitive design (VSD) framework to identify relevant values concerning a digital stress management intervention (dSMI) at the workplace, assess how users comprehend these values, and derive specific requirements for an ethics-informed design of dSMIs. VSD is a theoretically grounded framework that front-loads ethics by accounting for values throughout the design process of a technology. METHODS: We conducted a literature search to identify relevant values of dSMIs at the workplace. To understand how potential users comprehend these values and derive design requirements, we conducted a web-based study that contained closed and open questions with employees of a Swiss company, allowing both quantitative and qualitative analyses. RESULTS: The values health and well-being, privacy, autonomy, accountability, and identity were identified through our literature search. Statistical analysis of 170 responses from the web-based study revealed that the intention to use and perceived usefulness of a dSMI were moderate to high. Employees' moderate to high health and well-being concerns included worries that a dSMI would not be effective or would even amplify their stress levels. Privacy concerns were also rated on the higher end of the score range, whereas concerns regarding autonomy, accountability, and identity were rated lower. Moreover, a personalized dSMI with a monitoring system involving a machine learning-based analysis of data led to significantly higher privacy (P=.009) and accountability concerns (P=.04) than a dSMI without a monitoring system. In addition, integrability, user-friendliness, and digital independence emerged as novel values from the qualitative analysis of 85 text responses. CONCLUSIONS: Although most surveyed employees were willing to use a dSMI at the workplace, there were considerable health and well-being concerns with regard to effectiveness and problem perpetuation. For a minority of employees who value digital independence, a nondigital offer might be more suitable. In terms of the type of dSMI, privacy and accountability concerns must be particularly well addressed if a machine learning-based monitoring component is included. To help mitigate these concerns, we propose specific requirements to support the VSD of a dSMI at the workplace. The results of this work and our research protocol will inform future research on VSD-based interventions and further advance the integration of ethics in digital health.",2023,Apr,J Med Internet Res,25,,e44131,,10.2196/44131,37052996,#6942,Kerr 2023,"",""
Semantic Search in Psychosis: Modeling Local Exploitation and Global Exploration.,Lundin NB; Todd PM; Jones MN; Avery JE; O'Donnell BF; Hetrick WP,"Impairments in category verbal fluency task (VFT) performance have been widely documented in psychosis. These deficits may be due to disturbed ""cognitive foraging"" in semantic space, in terms of altered salience of cues that influence individuals to search locally within a subcategory of semantically related responses (""clustering"") or globally between subcategories (""switching""). To test this, we conducted a study in which individuals with schizophrenia (n = 21), schizotypal personality traits (n = 25), and healthy controls (n = 40) performed VFT with ""animals"" as the category. Distributional semantic model Word2Vec computed cosine-based similarities between words according to their statistical usage in a large text corpus. We then applied a validated foraging-based search model to these similarity values to obtain salience indices of frequency-based global search cues and similarity-based local cues. Analyses examined whether diagnosis predicted VFT performance, search strategies, cue salience, and the time taken to switch between vs search within clusters. Compared to control and schizotypal groups, individuals with schizophrenia produced fewer words, switched less, and exhibited higher global cue salience, indicating a selection of more common words when switching to new clusters. Global cue salience negatively associated with vocabulary ability in controls and processing speed in schizophrenia. Lastly, individuals with schizophrenia took a similar amount of time to switch to new clusters compared to control and schizotypal groups but took longer to transition between words within clusters. Findings of altered local exploitation and global exploration through semantic memory provide preliminary evidence of aberrant cognitive foraging in schizophrenia.",2020,Jan,Schizophr Bull Open,1,1,sgaa011,,10.1093/schizbullopen/sgaa011,32803160,#6947,Lundin 2020,"",""

Acceptability of Personal Sensing Among People With Alcohol Use Disorder: Observational Study.,Wyant K; Moshontz H; Ward SB; Fronk GE; Curtin JJ,"BACKGROUND: Personal sensing may improve digital therapeutics for mental health care by facilitating early screening, symptom monitoring, risk prediction, and personalized adaptive interventions. However, further development and the use of personal sensing requires a better understanding of its acceptability to people targeted for these applications. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the acceptability of active and passive personal sensing methods in a sample of people with moderate to severe alcohol use disorder using both behavioral and self-report measures. This sample was recruited as part of a larger grant-funded project to develop a machine learning algorithm to predict lapses. METHODS: Participants (N=154; n=77, 50% female; mean age 41, SD 11.9 years; n=134, 87% White and n=150, 97% non-Hispanic) in early recovery (1-8 weeks of abstinence) were recruited to participate in a 3-month longitudinal study. Participants were modestly compensated for engaging with active (eg, ecological momentary assessment [EMA], audio check-in, and sleep quality) and passive (eg, geolocation, cellular communication logs, and SMS text message content) sensing methods that were selected to tap into constructs from the Relapse Prevention model by Marlatt. We assessed 3 behavioral indicators of acceptability: participants' choices about their participation in the study at various stages in the procedure, their choice to opt in to provide data for each sensing method, and their adherence to a subset of the active methods (EMA and audio check-in). We also assessed 3 self-report measures of acceptability (interference, dislike, and willingness to use for 1 year) for each method. RESULTS: Of the 192 eligible individuals screened, 191 consented to personal sensing. Most of these individuals (169/191, 88.5%) also returned 1 week later to formally enroll, and 154 participated through the first month follow-up visit. All participants in our analysis sample opted in to provide data for EMA, sleep quality, geolocation, and cellular communication logs. Out of 154 participants, 1 (0.6%) did not provide SMS text message content and 3 (1.9%) did not provide any audio check-ins. The average adherence rate for the 4 times daily EMA was .80. The adherence rate for the daily audio check-in was .54. Aggregate participant ratings indicated that all personal sensing methods were significantly more acceptable (all P<.001) compared with neutral across subjective measures of interference, dislike, and willingness to use for 1 year. Participants did not significantly differ in their dislike of active methods compared with passive methods (P=.23). However, participants reported a higher willingness to use passive (vs active) methods for 1 year (P=.04).

RESULTS: Among 12,274 patients, 2379 deaths occurred in the course of 61,761 patient-years at risk, with 19,985 admissions during follow-up. Detachment was the most common personality feature. Presence of disinhibition was independently associated with a higher mortality risk, while anankastic traits were associated with a lower mortality risk. Increased likelihood of readmission was predicted by detachment, while decreased likelihood of readmission was associated with disinhibition and psychoticism traits.

Neural and behavioral markers of inhibitory control predict symptom improvement during internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for depression.,Thai M; Olson EA; Nickels S; Dillon DG; Webb CA; Ren B; Killgore WDS; Rauch SL; Rosso IM; Pizzagalli DA,"Poor inhibitory control contributes to deficits in emotion regulation, which are often targeted by treatments for major depressive disorder (MDD), including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Brain regions that contribute to inhibitory control and emotion regulation overlap; thus, inhibitory control might relate to response to CBT. In this study, we examined whether baseline inhibitory control and resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) within overlapping emotion regulation-inhibitory control regions predicted treatment response to internet-based CBT (iCBT). Participants with MDD were randomly assigned to iCBT (N = 30) or a monitored attention control (MAC) condition (N = 30).

From speech and video modalities, the automatic schizophrenia detection algorithm illustrates abnormal speech, head movement, and reading fluency during the reading task. In the speech modality, an acoustic model of speech emotional flatness in schizophrenia is established to reflect the emotional expression flatness of schizophrenic speech from the perspective of speech production and perception. In the video modality, the head-movement-related features are proposed to illustrate the spontaneous head movement caused by repeated reading and unconscious movement, and the reading-fluency-related features are proposed to convey the damaged degree of schizophrenic patients' reading fluency. The experimental data of this work are 160 segments of speech and video data recorded by 40 participants (20 schizophrenic patients and 20 normal controls). Combined with support vector machines and random forest, the accuracy of the proposed acoustic model, the head-movement-related features, and the reading-fluency-related features range from 94.38 to 96.50%, 73.38 to 83.38%, and 79.50 to 83.63%, respectively. The average accuracy of the proposed automatic schizophrenia detection algorithm reaches 97.50%. The experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed automatic detection algorithm as an auxiliary diagnostic method for schizophrenia.",2022,,Front Neurosci,16,,933049,,10.3389/fnins.2022.933049,35911987,#7077,Zhang 2022,"",""
Online Reviews of Specialized Drug Treatment Facilities-Identifying Potential Drivers of High and Low Patient Satisfaction.,Agarwal AK; Wong V; Pelullo AM; Guntuku S; Polsky D; Asch DA; Muruako J; Merchant RM,"BACKGROUND: Despite the importance of high-quality and patient-centered substance use disorder treatment, there are no standardized ratings of specialized drug treatment facilities and their services. Online platforms offer insights into potential drivers of high and low patient experience. OBJECTIVE: We sought to analyze publicly available online review content of specialized drug treatment facilities and identify themes within high and low ratings. DESIGN: This was a retrospective analysis of online ratings and reviews of specialized drug treatment facilities in Pennsylvania listed within the 2016 National Directory of Drug and Alcohol Abuse Treatment Facilities. Latent Dirichlet Allocation, a machine learning approach to narrative text, was used to identify themes within reviews. Differential Language Analysis was then used to measure correlations between themes and star ratings. SETTING: Online reviews of Pennsylvania's specialized drug treatment facilities posted to Google and Yelp (July 2010-August 2018). RESULTS: A total of 7823 online ratings were posted over 8 years. The distribution was bimodal (43% 5-star and 34% 1-star). The average weighted rating of a facility was 3.3 stars. Online themes correlated with 5-star ratings were the following: focus on recovery (r = 0.53), helpfulness of staff (r = 0.43), compassionate care (r = 0.37), experienced a life-changing moment (r = 0.32), and staff professionalism (r = 0.29). Themes correlated with a 1-star rating were waiting time (r = 0.41), poor accommodations (0.26), poor phone communication (r = 0.24), medications given (0.24), and appointment availability (r = 0.23). Themes derived from review content were similar to 9 of the 14 facility-level services highlighted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals are sharing their ratings and reviews of specialized drug treatment facilities on online platforms. Organically derived reviews of the patient experience, captured by online platforms, reveal potential drivers of high and low ratings.

"A real-world data analysis of electronic health records to investigate the associations of predominant negative symptoms with healthcare resource utilisation, costs and treatment patterns among patients with schizophrenia.",Patel R; Dembek C; Won Y; Kadakia A; Huang X; Zeni C; Pikalov A,"OBJECTIVES: Negative symptoms in schizophrenia are associated with significant illness burden. We sought to investigate clinical outcomes for patients with schizophrenia who present with predominant negative symptoms (PNS) vs without PNS. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of electronic health record (EHR) data. SETTING: 25 US providers of mental healthcare. PARTICIPANTS: 4444 adults with schizophrenia receiving care between 1999 and 2020. EXPOSURE: PNS defined as ≥3 negative symptoms and ≤3 positive symptoms recorded in EHR data at the time of the first recorded schizophrenia diagnosis (index date). Symptom data were ascertained using natural language processing applied to semistructured free text records documenting the mental state examination. A matched sample (1:1) of patients without PNS was used to compare outcomes. Follow-up data were obtained up to 12 months following the index date. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Mean number of psychiatric hospital admissions. SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Mean number of outpatient visits, estimated treatment costs, Clinical Global Impression - Severity score and antipsychotic treatments (12 months before and after index date). RESULTS: 360 (8%) patients had PNS and 4084 (92%) did not have PNS. Patients with PNS were younger (36.4 vs 39.7 years, p<0.001) with a greater prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities (schizoaffective disorders: 25.0 vs 18.4%, p=0.003; major depressive disorder: 17.8 vs 9.8%, p<0.001). During follow-up, patients with PNS had fewer days with an antipsychotic prescription (mean=111.8 vs 140.9 days, p<0.001). Compared with matched patients without PNS, patients with PNS were more likely to have a psychiatric inpatient hospitalisation (76.1% vs 59.7%, p<0.001) and had greater estimated inpatient costs ($16 893 vs $13 732, p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PNS were younger and presented with greater illness severity and more psychiatric comorbidities compared with patients without PNS.

TSA-CNN-AOA: Twitter sentiment analysis using CNN optimized via arithmetic optimization algorithm.,Aslan S; Kızıloluk S; Sert E,"COVID-19, a novel virus from the coronavirus family, broke out in Wuhan city of China and spread all over the world, killing more than 5.5 million people. The speed of spreading is still critical as an infectious disease, and it causes more and more deaths each passing day. COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in many different psychological effects on people's mental states, such as anxiety, fear, and similar complex feelings. Millions of people worldwide have shared their opinions on COVID-19 on several social media websites, particularly on Twitter. Therefore, it is likely to minimize the negative psychological impact of the disease on society by obtaining individuals' views on COVID-19 from social media platforms, making deductions from their statements, and identifying negative statements about the disease. In this respect, Twitter sentiment analysis (TSA), a recently popular research topic, is used to perform data analysis on social media platforms such as Twitter and reach certain conclusions. The present study, too, proposes TSA using convolutional neural network optimized via arithmetic optimization algorithm (TSA-CNN-AOA) approach. Firstly, using a designed API, 173,638 tweets about COVID-19 were extracted from Twitter between July 25, 2020, and August 30, 2020 to create a database. Later, significant information was extracted from this database using FastText Skip-gram. The proposed approach benefits from a designed convolutional neural network (CNN) model as a feature extractor. Thanks to arithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA), a feature selection process was also applied to the features obtained from CNN. Later, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine, and decision tree were used to classify tweets as positive, negative, and neutral. In order to measure the TSA performance of the proposed method, it was compared with different approaches. The results demonstrated that TSA-CNN-AOA (KNN) achieved the highest tweet classification performance with an accuracy rate of 95.098. It is evident from the experimental studies that the proposed approach displayed a much higher TSA performance compared to other similar approaches in the existing literature.",2023,,Neural Comput Appl,35,14,10311-10328,,10.1007/s00521-023-08236-2,36714074,#7140,Aslan 2023,"",""
Comparative Pathway Integrator: A Framework of Meta-Analytic Integration of Multiple Transcriptomic Studies for Consensual and Differential Pathway Analysis.,Zeng X; Zong W; Lin CW; Fang Z; Ma T; Lewis DA; Enwright JF; Tseng GC,"Pathway enrichment analysis provides a knowledge-driven approach to interpret differentially expressed genes associated with disease status. Many tools have been developed to analyze a single study. However, when multiple studies of different conditions are jointly analyzed, novel integrative tools are needed. In addition, pathway redundancy introduced by combining multiple public pathway databases hinders interpretation and knowledge discovery. We present a meta-analytic integration tool, Comparative Pathway Integrator (CPI), to address these issues using adaptively weighted Fisher's method to discover consensual and differential enrichment patterns, a tight clustering algorithm to reduce pathway redundancy, and a text mining algorithm to assist interpretation of the pathway clusters. We applied CPI to jointly analyze six psychiatric disorder transcriptomic studies to demonstrate its effectiveness, and found functions confirmed by previous biological studies as well as novel enrichment patterns.

Linguistic feature of anorexia nervosa: a prospective case-control pilot study.,Cuteri V; Minori G; Gagliardi G; Tamburini F; Malaspina E; Gualandi P; Rossi F; Moscano M; Francia V; Parmeggiani A,"PURPOSE: Attention has recently been paid to Clinical Linguistics for the detection and support of clinical conditions. Many works have been published on the ""linguistic profile"" of various clinical populations, but very few papers have been devoted to linguistic changes in patients with eating disorders. Patients with Anorexia Nervosa (AN) share similar psychological features such as disturbances in self-perceived body image, inflexible and obsessive thinking and anxious or depressive traits. We hypothesize that these characteristics can result in altered linguistic patterns and be detected using the Natural Language Processing tools. METHODS: We enrolled 51 young participants from December 2019 to February 2020 (age range: 14-18): 17 girls with a clinical diagnosis of AN, and 34 normal-weighted peers, matched by gender, age and educational level. Participants in each group were asked to produce three written texts (around 10-15 lines long). A rich set of linguistic features was extracted from the text samples and the statistical significance in pinpointing the pathological process was measured. RESULTS: Comparison between the two groups showed several linguistics indexes as statistically significant, with syntactic reduction as the most relevant trait of AN productions. In particular, the following features emerge as statistically significant in distinguishing AN girls and their normal-weighted peers: the length of the sentences, the complexity of the noun phrase, and the global syntactic complexity. This peculiar pattern of linguistic erosion may be due to the severe metabolic impairment also affecting the central nervous system in AN. CONCLUSION: These preliminary data showed the existence of linguistic parameters as probable linguistic markers of AN. However, the analysis of a bigger cohort, still ongoing, is needed to consolidate this assumption.

The elderly are a high-risk group and are highly vulnerable to COVID-19. Assistive software chatbots can enhance the mental health status of the elderly by providing support and companionship. The objective of this study was to validate a Thai artificial chatmate for the elderly during the COVID-19 pandemic and floods. METHODS: Chatbot design includes the establishment of a dataset and emotional word vectors in which data consisting of emotional sentences were converted into the word vector form using a pre-trained word2vec model. A word vector was then input into a convolutional neural network (CNN) and trained until the model converges using sentence embedding and similarity word segmentation. Sentence vectors were generated by averaging each word vector using an averaged vector method. For approximate similarity matching, the Annoy library was used to create the indices in tree sorting. Data were collected from 22 elderly and assessed by the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ). RESULTS: The study revealed that 72.73% of the respondents found the chatbot easy to learn and use, 63.64% of the respondents found the chatbot can autonomously determine the next course of action, and 59.09% of the respondents believed that troubleshooting guidelines were provided for overcoming errors.

How Health Care Workers Wield Influence Through Twitter Hashtags: Retrospective Cross-sectional Study of the Gun Violence and COVID-19 Public Health Crises.,Ojo A; Guntuku SC; Zheng M; Beidas RS; Ranney ML,"BACKGROUND: Twitter has emerged as a novel way for physicians to share ideas and advocate for policy change. #ThisIsOurLane (firearm injury) and #GetUsPPE (COVID-19) are examples of nationwide health care-led Twitter campaigns that went viral. Health care-initiated Twitter hashtags regarding major public health topics have gained national attention, but their content has not been systematically examined. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that Twitter discourse on two epidemics (firearm injury and COVID-19) would differ between tweets with health care-initiated hashtags (#ThisIsOurLane and #GetUsPPE) versus those with non-health care-initiated hashtags (#GunViolence and #COVID19). METHODS: Using natural language processing, we compared content, affect, and authorship of a random 1% of tweets using #ThisIsOurLane (Nov 2018-Oct 2019) and #GetUsPPE (March-May 2020), compared to #GunViolence and #COVID19 tweets, respectively. We extracted the relative frequency of single words and phrases and created two sets of features: (1) an open-vocabulary feature set to create 50 data-driven-determined word clusters to evaluate the content of tweets; and (2) a closed-vocabulary feature for psycholinguistic categorization among case and comparator tweets. In accordance with conventional linguistic analysis, we used a P<.001, after adjusting for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction, to identify potentially meaningful correlations between language features and outcomes. RESULTS: In total, 67% (n=4828) of #ThisIsOurLane tweets and 36.6% (n=7907) of #GetUsPPE tweets were authored by health care professionals, compared to 16% (n=1152) of #GunViolence and 9.8% (n=2117) of #COVID19 tweets. Tweets using #ThisIsOurLane and #GetUsPPE were more likely to contain health care-specific language; more language denoting positive emotions, affiliation, and group identity; and more action-oriented content compared to tweets with #GunViolence or #COVID19, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Tweets with health care-led hashtags expressed more positivity and more action-oriented language than the comparison hashtags.

We aimed to estimate the prevalence of OCS and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder in clinical records and identify clinical associations of OCS co-occurrence. Methods: Data were retrieved from the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust Biomedical Research Centre case register. The study population was restricted to individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia (ICD F20.x), schizoaffective disorder (ICD F25.x), or bipolar disorder (ICD F31.x) between 2007 and 2015. OCS and OCD were ascertained from structural fields and via Natural Language Processing software applied to free-text records. Clinical characteristics were obtained from Health of the Nation Outcome Scales for the analyses on associations between clinical characteristics and OCS/OCD status using logistic regressions with confounders considered. Results: 22,551 cases of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder were identified in the observation window. Among these, 5,179 (24.0%) were identified as having OCS (including an OCD diagnosis) and 2,574 (11.9%) specifically with comorbid OCD.

Latent information in fluency lists predicts functional decline in persons at risk for Alzheimer disease.,Clark DG; Kapur P; Geldmacher DS; Brockington JC; Harrell L; DeRamus TP; Blanton PD; Lokken K; Nicholas AP; Marson DC,"OBJECTIVE: We constructed random forest classifiers employing either the traditional method of scoring semantic fluency word lists or new methods. These classifiers were then compared in terms of their ability to diagnose Alzheimer disease (AD) or to prognosticate among individuals along the continuum from cognitively normal (CN) through mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. METHOD: Semantic fluency lists from 44 cognitively normal elderly individuals, 80 MCI patients, and 41 AD patients were transcribed into electronic text files and scored by four methods: traditional raw scores, clustering and switching scores, ""generalized"" versions of clustering and switching, and a method based on independent components analysis (ICA). Random forest classifiers based on raw scores were compared to ""augmented"" classifiers that incorporated newer scoring methods. Outcome variables included AD diagnosis at baseline, MCI conversion, increase in Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB) score, or decrease in Financial Capacity Instrument (FCI) score. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed for each classifier and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. We compared AUC between raw and augmented classifiers using Delong's test and assessed validity and reliability of the augmented classifier. RESULTS: Augmented classifiers outperformed classifiers based on raw scores for the outcome measures AD diagnosis (AUC .97 vs. .95), MCI conversion (AUC .91 vs. .77), CDR-SOB increase (AUC .90 vs. .79), and FCI decrease (AUC .89 vs. .72). Measures of validity and stability over time support the use of the method. CONCLUSION: Latent information in semantic fluency word lists is useful for predicting cognitive and functional decline among elderly individuals at increased risk for developing AD.

Examining Online Behaviors of Adult-Child and Spousal Caregivers for People Living With Alzheimer Disease or Related Dementias: Comparative Study in an Open Online Community.,Ni C; Song Q; Malin B; Song L; Commiskey P; Stratton L; Yin Z,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer disease or related dementias (ADRD) are severe neurological disorders that impair the thinking and memory skills of older adults. Most persons living with dementia receive care at home from their family members or other unpaid informal caregivers; this results in significant mental, physical, and financial challenges for these caregivers. To combat these challenges, many informal ADRD caregivers seek social support in online environments. Although research examining online caregiving discussions is growing, few investigations have distinguished caregivers according to their kin relationships with persons living with dementias. Various studies have suggested that caregivers in different relationships experience distinct caregiving challenges and support needs. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine and compare the online behaviors of adult-child and spousal caregivers, the 2 largest groups of informal ADRD caregivers, in an open online community. METHODS: We collected posts from ALZConnected, an online community managed by the Alzheimer's Association. To gain insights into online behaviors, we first applied structural topic modeling to identify topics and topic prevalence between adult-child and spousal caregivers. Next, we applied VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning) and LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) to evaluate sentiment changes in the online posts over time for both types of caregivers. We further built machine learning models to distinguish the posts of each caregiver type and evaluated them in terms of precision, recall, F(1)-score, and area under the precision-recall curve. Finally, we applied the best prediction model to compare the temporal trend of relationship-predicting capacities in posts between the 2 types of caregivers. RESULTS: Our analysis showed that the number of posts from both types of caregivers followed a long-tailed distribution, indicating that most caregivers in this online community were infrequent users. In comparison with adult-child caregivers, spousal caregivers tended to be more active in the community, publishing more posts and engaging in discussions on a wider range of caregiving topics. Spousal caregivers also exhibited slower growth in positive emotional communication over time. The best machine learning model for predicting adult-child, spousal, or other caregivers achieved an area under the precision-recall curve of 81.3%. The subsequent trend analysis showed that it became more difficult to predict adult-child caregiver posts than spousal caregiver posts over time. This suggests that adult-child and spousal caregivers might gradually shift their discussions from questions that are more directly related to their own experiences and needs to questions that are more general and applicable to other types of caregivers. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that it is important for researchers and community organizers to consider the heterogeneity of caregiving experiences and subsequent online behaviors among different types of caregivers when tailoring online peer support to meet the specific needs of each caregiver group.",2023,Nov,J Med Internet Res,25,,e48193,,10.2196/48193,37976095,#7230,Ni 2023,"",""
Research on the Evolution Trend of Group Psychological Security Risks Under Public Health Emergencies: Mining and Analysis Based on Social Media Data.,Gao Y; Liu H; Sun Y,"BACKGROUND: In the digital age, people's attitudes and psychological security towards public health emergencies will be shared. Similar or identical psychological security states are prone to clustering and differentiation, while differentiated group psychological security is more prone to polarization, leading to group psychological security risks and then posing a threat to social stability and national security. However, existing studies mostly use qualitative analysis methods to study group emotional risks. There are still limitations in the study of dynamics of group psychological security risks through mining real data of social media. PURPOSE: The study aims to use intelligent analysis methods to understand how group psychological security risks dynamically change. METHODS: The study draws on text sentiment analysis, Markov chains and time series analysis to construct a framework for the evolution of group psychological security risks. Based on this framework, text data was crawled on Sina Weibo platform, mainly consisting of posts during public health emergencies (March 1st to June 30th, 2022) in Shanghai, and a psychological security lexicon in the field of public health emergencies was constructed. This laid the foundation for identifying the tendencies, intensity, and transitions of individual text psychological security, and then exploring the evolution trend of group psychological security risks. RESULTS: Compared with the generation and reduction periods, group psychological security risks are more likely to occur during the outbreak and recovery periods, and the intensity level is also higher. The overall intensity of group psychological security risks shows an evolution trend of first increasing, then decreasing, and then increasing again. CONCLUSION: The paper provides an opportunity to explore the dynamics of psychological security in the digital space. Meanwhile, we call on the government and relevant management departments to pay more attention to the group psychological security risks formed during the outbreak and recovery periods of public health emergencies, and take corresponding measures in a timely manner to guide the public to transform the extreme psychological security state into the normal psychological security state, in order to prevent and resolve group psychological security risks, promote social stability and national security.",2024,,Psychol Res Behav Manag,17,,1787-1801,,10.2147/PRBM.S455112,38707961,#7238,Gao 2024,"",""
"Understanding the public stigma of mental illness: a mixed-methods, multi-level, exploratory triangulation study.",Walsh D; Foster J,"BACKGROUND: This study examines the role of themata in understanding mental health-related stigma. It is motivated by the need for alternative theoretical-methodological approaches beyond the dominant frameworks in education and contact-based anti-stigma public health efforts, which have shown mixed effects. Specifically, it addresses the need for a more nuanced framework in stigma research, one that is sensitive to the dialogues through which people relate themselves to mental health and stigma in context. METHODS: The research employs an exploratory mixed-methods approach, including the analysis of 529 news reports, 20 focus group discussions, and 19 one-to-one interviews, all concerning representations of shared living arrangements with someone perceived to have experiences of mental illness. Thematic analysis and natural language processing are used within a convergent triangulation design to analyze the data. RESULTS: We found that mental health and illness were communicated through an overarching Self/Other thema and five subordinate themata: normal/abnormal, harm/non-harm, bounded/non-bounded, and moral/immoral. Despite familiarity with psychological distress and 'modern' explanations of mental illness, concerns about social identity motivated representations of mental illness as a predominantly permanent, negative form of personhood marked by abnormality, harm, distance, and immorality. Additionally, concerns about personal vulnerability, including historically rooted fears of contagion, motivated distancing representations of mental illness, rather than neutral portrayals. CONCLUSIONS: Themata have under-developed theoretical and methodological potential for addressing mental health-related stigma, particularly in their ability to describe the dynamic ways in which culture motivates people to both resist and reproduce stigma, partly through ambivalences, absences, tensions, and ambiguities in representation. A critical discussion is provided on how themata may support ecological strategies in mental health campaigns over generic models, emphasizing the need to understand group knowledge and contact dynamics to mitigate adverse effects. Themata Public Health Unintended Consequences Mixed Methods Behaviour Change Natural Language Processing.",2024,Jul,BMC Psychol,12,1,403,,10.1186/s40359-024-01887-3,39033289,#7266,Walsh 2024,"",""

Machine learning approach to measurement of criticism: The core dimension of expressed emotion.,Movaghar A; Page D; Saha K; Rynn M; Greenberg J,"Expressed emotion (EE), a measure of the family's emotional climate, is a fundamental measure in caregiving research. A core dimension of EE is the level of criticism expressed by the caregiver to the care recipient, with a high level of criticism a marker of significant distress in the household. The Five-Minute Speech Sample (FMSS), the most commonly used brief measure of EE, requires time-consuming manual processing and scoring by a highly trained expert. In this study, we used natural language processing and supervised machine learning techniques to develop a fully automated framework to evaluate caregiver criticism level based on the verbatim transcript of the FMSS. The success of the machine learning algorithm was established by demonstrating that the classification of maternal caregivers as high versus low EE was consistent with the classification of these 298 maternal caregivers of adult children with schizophrenia using standard manual coding procedures, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.76. Evidence of construct validity was established by demonstrating that maternal caregivers of adults with schizophrenia, who were classified as having a high level of criticism had higher levels of caregiver burden, reported that their child had more psychiatric symptoms and behaviors and perceived that their child had greater control over these symptoms and behaviors. Additionally, maternal caregivers who had high levels of criticism reported having a poorer quality of relationship with their child with schizophrenia than maternal caregivers low on criticism. Rapid measurement of criticism facilitates the incorporation of this dimension into research across a broad range of caregiving contexts.

AIDS as social construction: text mining of AIDS-related information in the Italian press.,Caputo A; Giacchetta A; Langher V,"Given the relevance of AIDS as a public health problem in the Italian context and of the role of mass media in the social construction of the phenomenon, the aim of the present study is twofold: (1) to explore the main AIDS-related themes in the Italian popular press; (2) to analyse the temporal trends of AIDS representations over the last decades. For the research, we decided to consult Italian newspaper articles produced between 1985 and 1990 and between 2005 and 2010 using the archives of the main two national newspapers (La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera), resulting in an overall sample of 446 newspaper articles.

What Do You Say Before You Relapse? How Language Use in a Peer-to-peer Online Discussion Forum Predicts Risky Drinking among Those in Recovery.,Kornfield R; Toma CL; Shah DV; Moon TJ; Gustafson DH,"Increasingly, individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) seek and provide support for relapse prevention in text-based online environments such as discussion forums. This paper investigates whether language use within a peer-to-peer discussion forum can predict future relapse among individuals treated for AUD. A total of 104 AUD sufferers who had completed residential treatment participated in a mobile phone-based relapse-prevention program, where they communicated via an online forum over the course of a year. We extracted patterns of language use on the forum within the first four months on study using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), a dictionary-based text analysis program. Participants reported their incidence of risky drinking via a survey at 4, 8, and 12 months. A logistic regression model was built to predict the likelihood that individuals would engage in risky drinking within a year based on their language use, while controlling for baseline characteristics and rates of utilizing the mobile system. Results show that all baseline characteristics and system use factors explained just 13% of the variance in relapse, whereas a small number of linguistic cues, including swearing and cognitive mechanism words, accounted for an additional 32% of the total 45% of variance in relapse explained by the model. Effective models for predicting relapse are needed. Messages exchanged on AUD forums could provide an unobtrusive and cost-effective window into the future health outcomes of AUD sufferers, and their psychological underpinnings. As online communication expands, models that leverage user-submitted text toward predicting relapse will be increasingly scalable and actionable.",2018,Sep,Health Commun,33,9,1184-1193,,10.1080/10410236.2017.1350906,28792228,#7402,Kornfield 2018,"",""

Such theories may affect mental health and treatment adherence. Using natural language processing techniques, we investigated large-scale text data about theories that persons with MS have about the causes of their disease. We examined the topics into which their theories could be grouped and the prevalence of each theory topic. METHODS: A total of 486 participants of the Swiss MS Registry longitudinal citizen science project provided text data on their theories about the etiology of MS. We used the transformer-based BERTopic Python library for topic modeling to identify underlying topics. We then conducted an in-depth characterization of the topics and assessed their prevalence. RESULTS: The topic modeling analysis identifies 19 distinct topics that participants theorize as causal for their MS. The topics most frequently cited are Mental Distress (31.5%), Stress (Exhaustion, Work) (29.8%), Heredity/Familial Aggregation (27.4%), and Diet, Obesity (16.0%).

"Challenging sleep-wake behaviors reported in informal, conversational interviews of caregivers of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder.",Spruyt K; Ipsiroglu O; Stockler S; Reynolds JN,"Objective: Sleep complaints are clinically expected in children exposed to alcohol during pregnancy. We aim to reveal patterns of association among sleep-wake behaviors that are challenging in the life of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Methods: Through text-mining analyses, we numericized the transcripts of 59 caregiver's informal, conversational interviews. That is, the relative frequencies-of-occurrences of words as well as their semantic specificities (italic) were clustered, categorized, and visualized for patterns. Results: A total of 4008 words were indexed where sleep took the 91st place of most important words. Sleep and wake were however not associatively conversed throughout the interviews. Sleep-related words conversed were: night, nap, apnea, asleep, awake, bed, bedroom, bedtime, mattress, melatonin, overnight, and wake-up. Among some FASD-characteristic words describing the challenges were: huge, alcohol, manage*, stop, adopt, crazy*. The semantic space reflecting these challenges experienced in caring for children with FASD was divided into two axes: child-oriented vs. other-oriented words, and day-related and night-related words. The position of sleep shows that problematic sleep was expressed as a 'family' issue. Clumsy* was interrelated with problematic sleeping and waking. Despite that mostly night was associatively conversed, the association of Routines, Managing, and Planning with sleep underscores the challenges faced. Conclusion: When conversing caregivers of children with FASD seldom interrelate 'sleep' but rather 'night' with FASD-characteristics.

Topic Modeling of Smoking- and Cessation-Related Posts to the American Cancer Society's Cancer Survivor Network (CSN): Implications for Cessation Treatment for Cancer Survivors Who Smoke.,Westmaas JL; McDonald BR; Portier KM,"INTRODUCTION: Smoking is a risk factor in at least 18 cancers, and approximately two-thirds of cancer survivors continue smoking following diagnosis. Text mining of survivors' online posts related to smoking and quitting could inform strategies to reduce smoking in this vulnerable population. METHODS: We identified posts containing smoking/cessation-related keywords from the Cancer Survivors Network (CSN), an online cancer survivor community of 166 000 members and over 468 000 posts since inception. Unsupervised topic model analysis of posts since 2000 using Latent Dirichlet Allocation extracted 70 latent topics which two subject experts inspected for themes based on representative terms. Posterior analysis assessed the distribution of topics within posts, and the range of themes discussed across posts. RESULTS: Less than 1% of posts (n = 3998) contained smoking/cessation-related terms, and covered topics related to cancer diagnoses, treatments, and coping. The most frequent smoking-related topics were quit smoking methods (5.4% of posts), and the environment for quitters (2.9% of posts), such as the stigma associated with being a smoker diagnosed with cancer and lack of empathy experienced compared to nonsmokers. Smoking as a risk factor for one's diagnosis was a primary topic in only 1.7% of smoking/cessation-related posts. CONCLUSIONS: The low frequency of smoking/cessation-related posts may be due to expected criticism/stigma for smoking but may also suggests a need for health care providers to address smoking and assist with quitting in the diagnostic and treatment process. Topic model analysis revealed potential barriers that should be addressed in devising clinical or population-level interventions for cancer survivors who smoke. IMPLICATIONS: Although smoking is a major risk factor for cancer, little is known about cancer patients' or survivors' views or concerns about smoking and quitting. This study used text mining of posts to an online community of cancer patients and survivors to investigate contexts in which smoking or quitting is discussed. Results indicated that smoking and quitting discussions were relatively rare, but nevertheless provide insight into barriers that may need to be addressed in cessation interventions for survivors.",2017,Aug,Nicotine Tob Res,19,8,952-959,,10.1093/ntr/ntx064,28340059,#7520,Westmaas 2017,"",""
Lexicon-Based Sentiment Analysis in Behavioral Research.,Cero I; Luo J; Falligant JM,"A complete science of human behavior requires a comprehensive account of the verbal behavior those humans exhibit. Existing behavioral theories of such verbal behavior have produced compelling insight into language's underlying function, but the expansive program of research those theories deserve has unfortunately been slow to develop. We argue that the status quo's manually implemented and study-specific coding systems are too resource intensive to be worthwhile for most behavior analysts. These high input costs in turn discourage research on verbal behavior overall. We propose lexicon-based sentiment analysis as a more modern and efficient approach to the study of human verbal products, especially naturally occurring ones (e.g., psychotherapy transcripts, social media posts). In the present discussion, we introduce the reader to principles of sentiment analysis, highlighting its usefulness as a behavior analytic tool for the study of verbal behavior.

Social media posts offer insight into public perceptions of mental health conditions and may also inform strategies to identify, engage, and support hard-to-reach patient populations such as individuals affected by hikikomori. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we seek to identify the types of content on Twitter related to hikikomori in the Japanese language and to assess Twitter users' engagement with that content. METHODS: We conducted a mixed methods analysis of a random sample of 4940 Japanese tweets from February to August 2018 using a hashtag (#hikikomori). Qualitative content analysis included examination of the text of each tweet, development of a codebook, and categorization of tweets into relevant codes. For quantitative analysis (n=4859 tweets), we used bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models, adjusted for multiple comparisons, and estimated the predicted probabilities of tweets receiving engagement (likes or retweets). RESULTS: Our content analysis identified 9 codes relevant to tweets about hikikomori: personal anecdotes, social support, marketing, advice, stigma, educational opportunities, refuge (ibasho), employment opportunities, and medicine and science. Tweets about personal anecdotes were the most common (present in 2747/4859, 56.53% of the tweets), followed by social support (902/4859, 18.56%) and marketing (624/4859, 12.84%). In the adjusted models, tweets coded as stigma had a lower predicted probability of likes (-33 percentage points, 95% CI -42 to -23 percentage points; P<.001) and retweets (-11 percentage points, 95% CI -18 to -4 percentage points; P<.001), personal anecdotes had a lower predicted probability of retweets (-8 percentage points, 95% CI -14 to -3 percentage points; P=.002), marketing had a lower predicted probability of likes (-13 percentage points, 95% CI -21 to -6 percentage points; P<.001), and social support had a higher predicted probability of retweets (+15 percentage points, 95% CI 6-24 percentage points; P=.001), compared with all tweets without each of these codes. CONCLUSIONS: Japanese tweets about hikikomori reflect a unique array of topics, many of which have not been identified in prior research and vary in their likelihood of receiving engagement.

How People With a Bipolar Disorder Diagnosis Talk About Personal Recovery in Peer Online Support Forums: Corpus Framework Analysis Using the POETIC Framework.,Jagfeld G; Lobban F; Humphreys C; Rayson P; Jones SH,"BACKGROUND: Personal recovery is of particular value in bipolar disorder, where symptoms often persist despite treatment. We previously defined the POETIC (Purpose and Meaning, Optimism and Hope, Empowerment, Tensions, Identity, Connectedness) framework for personal recovery in bipolar disorder. So far, personal recovery has only been studied in researcher-constructed environments (eg, interviews and focus groups). Support forum posts can serve as a complementary naturalistic data resource to understand the lived experience of personal recovery. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to answer the question ""What can online support forum posts reveal about the experience of personal recovery in bipolar disorder in relation to the POETIC framework?"" METHODS: By integrating natural language processing, corpus linguistics, and health research methods, this study analyzed public, bipolar disorder support forum posts relevant to the lived experience of personal recovery. By comparing 4462 personal recovery-relevant posts by 1982 users to 25,197 posts not relevant to personal recovery, we identified 130 significantly overused key lemmas. Key lemmas were coded according to the POETIC framework. RESULTS: Personal recovery-related discussions primarily focused on 3 domains: ""Purpose and meaning"" (particularly reproductive decisions and work), ""Connectedness"" (romantic relationships and social support), and ""Empowerment"" (self-management and personal responsibility). This study confirmed the validity of the POETIC framework to capture personal recovery experiences shared on the web and highlighted new aspects beyond previous studies using interviews and focus groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to analyze naturalistic data on personal recovery in bipolar disorder. By indicating the key areas that people focus on in personal recovery when posting freely and the language they use, this study provides helpful starting points for formal and informal carers to understand the concerns of people diagnosed with a bipolar disorder and to consider how to best offer support.",2023,Nov,JMIR Med Inform,11,,e46544,,10.2196/46544,37962520,#7623,Jagfeld 2023,"",""
Predicting Daily Sheltering Arrangements among Youth Experiencing Homelessness Using Diary Measurements Collected by Ecological Momentary Assessment.,Suchting R; Businelle MS; Hwang SW; Padhye NS; Yang Y; Santa Maria DM,"Youths experiencing homelessness (YEH) often cycle between various sheltering locations including spending nights on the streets, in shelters and with others.

Detecting Bipolar Depression From Geographic Location Data.,Palmius N; Tsanas A; Saunders KEA; Bilderbeck AC; Geddes JR; Goodwin GM; De Vos M,"OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to identify periods of depression using geolocation movements recorded from mobile phones in a prospective community study of individuals with bipolar disorder (BD). METHODS: Anonymized geographic location recordings from 22 BD participants and 14 healthy controls (HC) were collected over 3 months. Participants reported their depressive symptomatology using a weekly questionnaire (QIDS-SR(16)). Recorded location data were preprocessed by detecting and removing imprecise data points and features were extracted to assess the level and regularity of geographic movements of the participant. A subset of features were selected using a wrapper feature selection method and presented to 1) a linear regression model and a quadratic generalized linear model with a logistic link function for questionnaire score estimation; and 2) a quadratic discriminant analysis classifier for depression detection in BD participants based on their questionnaire responses. R esults: HC participants did not report depressive symptoms and their features showed similar distributions to nondepressed BD participants. Questionnaire score estimation using geolocation-derived features from BD participants demonstrated an optimal mean absolute error rate of 3.73, while depression detection demonstrated an optimal (median ± IQR) [Formula: see text] score of 0.857 ± 0.022 using five features (classification accuracy: 0.849 ± 0.016; sensitivity: 0.839 ± 0.014; specificity: 0.872 ± 0.047).

Employing computational linguistics techniques to identify limited patient health literacy: Findings from the ECLIPPSE study.,Schillinger D; Balyan R; Crossley SA; McNamara DS; Liu JY; Karter AJ,"OBJECTIVE: To develop novel, scalable, and valid literacy profiles for identifying limited health literacy patients by harnessing natural language processing. DATA SOURCE: With respect to the linguistic content, we analyzed 283 216 secure messages sent by 6941 diabetes patients to physicians within an integrated system's electronic portal. Sociodemographic, clinical, and utilization data were obtained via questionnaire and electronic health records. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study used natural language processing and machine learning to generate five unique ""Literacy Profiles"" by employing various sets of linguistic indices: Flesch-Kincaid (LP_FK); basic indices of writing complexity, including lexical diversity (LP_LD) and writing quality (LP_WQ); and advanced indices related to syntactic complexity, lexical sophistication, and diversity, modeled from self-reported (LP_SR), and expert-rated (LP_Exp) health literacy. We first determined the performance of each literacy profile relative to self-reported and expert-rated health literacy to discriminate between high and low health literacy and then assessed Literacy Profiles' relationships with known correlates of health literacy, such as patient sociodemographics and a range of health-related outcomes, including ratings of physician communication, medication adherence, diabetes control, comorbidities, and utilization. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: LP_SR and LP_Exp performed best in discriminating between high and low self-reported (C-statistics: 0.86 and 0.58, respectively) and expert-rated health literacy (C-statistics: 0.71 and 0.87, respectively) and were significantly associated with educational attainment, race/ethnicity, Consumer Assessment of Provider and Systems (CAHPS) scores, adherence, glycemia, comorbidities, and emergency department visits. CONCLUSIONS: Since health literacy is a potentially remediable explanatory factor in health care disparities, the development of automated health literacy indicators represents a significant accomplishment with broad clinical and population health applications.

Initial Progress Toward Development of a Voice-Based Computer-Delivered Motivational Intervention for Heavy Drinking College Students: An Experimental Study.,Kahler CW; Lechner WJ; MacGlashan J; Wray TB; Littman ML,"BACKGROUND: Computer-delivered interventions have been shown to be effective in reducing alcohol consumption in heavy drinking college students. However, these computer-delivered interventions rely on mouse, keyboard, or touchscreen responses for interactions between the users and the computer-delivered intervention. The principles of motivational interviewing suggest that in-person interventions may be effective, in part, because they encourage individuals to think through and speak aloud their motivations for changing a health behavior, which current computer-delivered interventions do not allow. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to take the initial steps toward development of a voice-based computer-delivered intervention that can ask open-ended questions and respond appropriately to users' verbal responses, more closely mirroring a human-delivered motivational intervention. METHODS: We developed (1) a voice-based computer-delivered intervention that was run by a human controller and that allowed participants to speak their responses to scripted prompts delivered by speech generation software and (2) a text-based computer-delivered intervention that relied on the mouse, keyboard, and computer screen for all interactions. We randomized 60 heavy drinking college students to interact with the voice-based computer-delivered intervention and 30 to interact with the text-based computer-delivered intervention and compared their ratings of the systems as well as their motivation to change drinking and their drinking behavior at 1-month follow-up. RESULTS: Participants reported that the voice-based computer-delivered intervention engaged positively with them in the session and delivered content in a manner consistent with motivational interviewing principles. At 1-month follow-up, participants in the voice-based computer-delivered intervention condition reported significant decreases in quantity, frequency, and problems associated with drinking, and increased perceived importance of changing drinking behaviors. In comparison to the text-based computer-delivered intervention condition, those assigned to voice-based computer-delivered intervention reported significantly fewer alcohol-related problems at the 1-month follow-up (incident rate ratio 0.60, 95% CI 0.44-0.83, P=.002). The conditions did not differ significantly on perceived importance of changing drinking or on measures of drinking quantity and frequency of heavy drinking. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that it is feasible to construct a series of open-ended questions and a bank of responses and follow-up prompts that can be used in a future fully automated voice-based computer-delivered intervention that may mirror more closely human-delivered motivational interventions to reduce drinking. Such efforts will require using advanced speech recognition capabilities and machine-learning approaches to train a program to mirror the decisions made by human controllers in the voice-based computer-delivered intervention used in this study. In addition, future studies should examine enhancements that can increase the perceived warmth and empathy of voice-based computer-delivered intervention, possibly through greater personalization, improvements in the speech generation software, and embodying the computer-delivered intervention in a physical form.",2017,Jun,JMIR Ment Health,4,2,e25,,10.2196/mental.7571,28659259,#7661,Kahler 2017,"",""

A natural language processing algorithm was developed to established whether loss of weight was recorded around the time of dementia diagnosis. Cox proportional hazard models were applied to examine the associations of reported weight loss with mortality and emergency hospitalization. RESULTS: Weight loss around the time of dementia was recorded in 25.5% of the whole sample and was most common in patients with DLB.

The challenge is, however, to provide easy, quick and relevant access to the vast amount of information that is available. One step towards facilitating information access to online health data is opinion mining. Even though the classification of patient opinions into positive and negative has been previously tackled, most works make use of machine learning methods and bags of words. Our first contribution is an extensive evaluation of different features, including lexical, syntactic, semantic, network-based, sentiment-based and word embeddings features to represent patient-authored texts for polarity classification. The second contribution of this work is the study of polar facts (i.e. objective information with polar connotations). Traditionally, the presence of polar facts has been neglected and research in polarity classification has been bounded to opinionated texts. We demonstrate the existence and importance of polar facts for the polarity classification of health information. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We annotate a set of more than 3500 posts to online health forums of breast cancer, crohn and different allergies, respectively. Each sentence in a post is manually labeled as ""experience"", ""fact"" or ""opinion"", and as ""positive"", ""negative"" and ""neutral"". Using this data, we train different machine learning algorithms and compare traditional bags of words representations with word embeddings in combination with lexical, syntactic, semantic, network-based and emotional properties of texts to automatically classify patient-authored contents into positive, negative and neutral. Beside, we experiment with a combination of textual and semantic representations by generating concept embeddings using the UMLS Metathesaurus. RESULTS: We reach two main results: first, we find that it is possible to predict polarity of patient-authored contents with a very high accuracy (≈ 70 percent) using word embeddings, and that this considerably outperforms more traditional representations like bags of words; and second, when dealing with medical information, negative and positive facts (i.e. objective information) are nearly as frequent as negative and positive opinions and experiences (i.e. subjective information), and their importance for polarity classification is crucial.",2018,,PLoS One,13,11,e0207996,,10.1371/journal.pone.0207996,30496232,#7757,Carrillo-de-Albornoz 2018,"",""
"Engagement With Motivational Interviewing and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Components of a Web-Based Alcohol Intervention, Elicitation of Change Talk and Sustain Talk, and Impact on Drinking Outcomes: Secondary Data Analysis.",Mujcic A; Linke S; Hamilton F; Phillips A; Khadjesari Z,"BACKGROUND: Down Your Drink (DYD) is a widely used unguided web-based alcohol moderation program for the general public based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational interviewing (MI); it provides users with many opportunities to enter free-text responses. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess participants' use of key CBT and MI components, the presence of change talk and sustain talk within their responses, and whether these data are associated with drinking outcomes after 3 months. METHODS: An exploratory secondary data analysis was conducted on data collected in 2008 from the definitive randomized trial of DYD (N=503). Past week alcohol use at baseline and 3-month follow-up were measured with the TOT-AL. Covariates included baseline alcohol use, age, gender, education level, and word count of the responses. Use of MI and CBT components and presence of change talk and sustain talk were coded by two independent coders (Cohen κ range 0.91-1). Linear model regressions on the subsample of active users (n=410) are presented along with a negative binomial regression. RESULTS: The most commonly used component was the listing of pros and cons of drinking. The number of listed high-risk situations was associated with lower alcohol use at 3-month follow-up (B(adj) -2.15, 95% CI -3.92 to -0.38, P=.02). Findings on the effects of the percentage of change talk and the number of listed strategies to deal with high-risk situations were inconsistent. CONCLUSIONS: An unguided web-based alcohol moderation program can elicit change talk and sustain talk. This secondary analysis suggests that the number of listed high-risk situations can predict alcohol use at 3-month follow-up. Other components show inconsistent findings and should be studied further.",2020,Sep,J Med Internet Res,22,9,e17285,,10.2196/17285,32870162,#7797,Mujcic 2020,"",""
The Effect of Timing and Frequency of Push Notifications on Usage of a Smartphone-Based Stress Management Intervention: An Exploratory Trial.,Morrison LG; Hargood C; Pejovic V; Geraghty AW; Lloyd S; Goodman N; Michaelides DT; Weston A; Musolesi M; Weal MJ; Yardley L,"Push notifications offer a promising strategy for enhancing engagement with smartphone-based health interventions. Intelligent sensor-driven machine learning models may improve the timeliness of notifications by adapting delivery to a user's current context (e.g. location). This exploratory mixed-methods study examined the potential impact of timing and frequency on notification response and usage of Healthy Mind, a smartphone-based stress management intervention. 77 participants were randomised to use one of three versions of Healthy Mind that provided: intelligent notifications; daily notifications within pre-defined time frames; or occasional notifications within pre-defined time frames. Notification response and Healthy Mind usage were automatically recorded. Telephone interviews explored participants' experiences of using Healthy Mind. Participants in the intelligent and daily conditions viewed (d = .47, .44 respectively) and actioned (d = .50, .43 respectively) more notifications compared to the occasional group. Notification group had no meaningful effects on percentage of notifications viewed or usage of Healthy Mind. No meaningful differences were indicated between the intelligent and non-intelligent groups. Our findings suggest that frequent notifications may encourage greater exposure to intervention content without deterring engagement, but adaptive tailoring of notification timing does not always enhance their use. Hypotheses generated from this study require testing in future work.

The State of Mind of Health Care Professionals in Light of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Text Analysis Study of Twitter Discourses.,Elyashar A; Plochotnikov I; Cohen IC; Puzis R; Cohen O,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected populations worldwide, with extreme health, economic, social, and political implications. Health care professionals (HCPs) are at the core of pandemic response and are among the most crucial factors in maintaining coping capacities. Yet, they are also vulnerable to mental health effects caused by managing a long-lasting emergency with a lack of resources and under complicated personal concerns. However, there are a lack of longitudinal studies that investigate the HCP population. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the state of mind of HCPs as expressed in online discussions published on Twitter in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, from the onset of the pandemic until the end of 2020. METHODS: The population for this study was selected from followers of a few hundred Twitter accounts of health care organizations and common HCP points of interest. We used active learning, a process that iteratively uses machine learning and manual data labeling, to select the large-scale population of Twitter accounts maintained by English-speaking HCPs, focusing on individuals rather than official organizations. We analyzed the topics and emotions in their discourses during 2020. The topic distributions were obtained using the latent Dirichlet allocation algorithm. We defined a measure of topic cohesion and described the most cohesive topics. The emotions expressed in tweets during 2020 were compared to those in 2019. Finally, the emotion intensities were cross-correlated with the pandemic waves to explore possible associations between the pandemic development and emotional response. RESULTS: We analyzed the timelines of 53,063 Twitter profiles, 90% of which were maintained by individual HCPs. Professional topics accounted for 44.5% of tweets by HCPs from January 1, 2019, to December 6, 2020. Events such as the pandemic waves, US elections, or the George Floyd case affected the HCPs' discourse. The levels of joy and sadness exceeded their minimal and maximal values from 2019, respectively, 80% of the time (P=.001). Most interestingly, fear preceded the pandemic waves, in terms of the differences in confirmed cases, by 2 weeks with a Spearman correlation coefficient of ρ(47 pairs)=0.340 (P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: Analyses of longitudinal data over the year 2020 revealed that a large fraction of HCP discourse is directly related to professional content, including the increase in the volume of discussions following the pandemic waves. The changes in emotional patterns (ie, decrease in joy and increase in sadness, fear, and disgust) during the year 2020 may indicate the utmost importance in providing emotional support for HCPs to prevent fatigue, burnout, and mental health disorders during the postpandemic period. The increase in fear 2 weeks in advance of pandemic waves indicates that HCPs are in a position, and with adequate qualifications, to anticipate pandemic development, and could serve as a bottom-up pathway for expressing morbidity and clinical situations to health agencies.",2021,Oct,J Med Internet Res,23,10,e30217,,10.2196/30217,34550899,#7849,Elyashar 2021,"",""
Looking for Razors and Needles in a Haystack: Multifaceted Analysis of Suicidal Declarations on Social Media-A Pragmalinguistic Approach.,Ptaszynski M; Zasko-Zielinska M; Marcinczuk M; Leliwa G; Fortuna M; Soliwoda K; Dziublewska I; Hubert O; Skrzek P; Piesiewicz J; Karbowska P; Dowgiallo M; Eronen J; Tempska P; Brochocki M; Godny M; Wroczynski M,"In this paper, we study language used by suicidal users on Reddit social media platform. To do that, we firstly collect a large-scale dataset of Reddit posts and annotate it with highly trained and expert annotators under a rigorous annotation scheme. Next, we perform a multifaceted analysis of the dataset, including: (1) the analysis of user activity before and after posting a suicidal message, and (2) a pragmalinguistic study on the vocabulary used by suicidal users. In the second part of the analysis, we apply LIWC, a dictionary-based toolset widely used in psychology and linguistic research, which provides a wide range of linguistic category annotations on text. However, since raw LIWC scores are not sufficiently reliable, or informative, we propose a procedure to decrease the possibility of unreliable and misleading LIWC scores leading to misleading conclusions by analyzing not each category separately, but in pairs with other categories. The analysis of the results supported the validity of the proposed approach by revealing a number of valuable information on the vocabulary used by suicidal users and helped to pin-point false predictors. For example, we were able to specify that death-related words, typically associated with suicidal posts in the majority of the literature, become false predictors, when they co-occur with apostrophes, even in high-risk subreddits. On the other hand, the category-pair based disambiguation helped to specify that death becomes a predictor only when co-occurring with future-focused language, informal language, discrepancy, or 1st person pronouns. The promising applicability of the approach was additionally analyzed for its limitations, where we found out that although LIWC is a useful and easily applicable tool, the lack of any contextual processing makes it unsuitable for application in psychological and linguistic studies. We conclude that disadvantages of LIWC can be easily overcome by creating a number of high-performance AI-based classifiers trained for annotation of similar categories as LIWC, which we plan to pursue in future work.",2021,Nov,Int J Environ Res Public Health,18,22,,,10.3390/ijerph182211759,34831513,#7852,Ptaszynski 2021,"",""

Mechanisms upholding the persistence of stigma across 100 years of historical text.,Charlesworth TES; Hatzenbuehler ML,"Today, many social groups face negative stereotypes. Is such negativity a stable feature of society and, if so, what mechanisms maintain stability both within and across group targets? Answering these theoretically and practically important questions requires data on dozens of group stereotypes examined simultaneously over historical and societal scales, which is only possible through recent advances in Natural Language Processing. Across two studies, we use word embeddings from millions of English-language books over 100 years (1900-2000) and extract stereotypes for 58 stigmatized groups. Study 1 examines aggregate, societal-level trends in stereotype negativity by averaging across these groups. Results reveal striking persistence in aggregate negativity (no meaningful slope), suggesting that society maintains a stable level of negative stereotypes. Study 2 introduces and tests a new framework identifying potential mechanisms upholding stereotype negativity over time. We find evidence of two key sources of this aggregate persistence: within-group ""reproducibility"" (e.g., stereotype negativity can be maintained by using different traits with the same underlying meaning) and across-group ""replacement"" (e.g., negativity from one group is transferred to other related groups). These findings provide novel historical evidence of mechanisms upholding stigmatization in society and raise new questions regarding the possibility of future stigma change.",2024,May,Sci Rep,14,1,11069,,10.1038/s41598-024-61044-z,38744930,#7956,CharlesworthTES 2024,"",""
Research Letter: Characterizing spin in psychiatric clinical research literature using large language models.,Perlis RH,"IMPORTANCE: Spin is a common form of biased reporting that misrepresents study results in publications as more positive than an objective assessment would indicate, but its prevalence in psychiatric journals is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To apply a large language model to characterize the extent to which original reports of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions in psychiatric journals reflect spin. DESIGN: We identified abstracts from studies published between 2013 and 2023 in 3 high-impact psychiatric journals describing randomized trials or meta-analyses of interventions. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Presence or absence of spin estimated by a large language model (GPT4-turbo, turbo-2024-04-09), validated using gold standard abstracts with and without spin. RESULTS: Among a total of 663 abstracts, 296 (44.6%) exhibited possible or probable spin - 230/529 (43.5%) randomized trials, 66/134 (49.3%) meta-analyses; 148/310 (47.7%) for medication, 107/238 (45.0%) for psychotherapy, and 41/115 (35.7%) for other interventions. In a multivariable logistic regression model, reports of randomized trials, and non-pharmacologic/non-psychotherapy interventions, were less likely to exhibit spin, as were more recent publications. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A substantial subset of psychiatric intervention abstracts in high-impact journals may contain results presented in a potentially misleading way, with the potential to impact clinical practice. The success in automating spin detection via large language models may facilitate identification and revision to minimize spin in future publications.",2024,Jul,medRxiv,,,,,10.1101/2024.06.30.24309737,39006438,#7997,Perlis 2024,"",""
Self-care in children and young people with complex chronic conditions: a qualitative study using Emotional Text Mining.,Spitaletta G; Biagioli V; Greco F; Mascolo R; Liburdi A; Manzi G; Gawronski O; Ricci R; Tiozzo E; Vellone E; Grimaldi Capitello T; Salata M; Raponi M; Dall'Oglio I,"OBJECTIVES: To explore: (1) self-care behaviors in children and young people (range: 6 months-24 years) with complex chronic conditions, characterized by the diagnosis of a severe chronic condition, substantial family-identified needs, functional limitations associated with technology dependence, and intensive use of healthcare services; (2) the contribution to self-care of family members and other persons involved in the child's health and daily life context (e.g., health professionals and teachers), and (3) the principal factors that might have influenced the self-care process associated with developmental age. METHODS: A qualitative descriptive study was conducted in an Italian academic tertiary pediatric hospital between September 2020 and May 2021. Overall, 25 focus groups and 7 online interviews were conducted via videoconferencing. Textual data were analyzed using Emotional Text Mining to identify three levels of communication: the factors, the main themes (clusters), and the sub-themes. RESULTS: A total of 104 participants were enrolled, including 27 patients with complex chronic conditions (12 males, mean age = 11.1 ± 4.40), 33 parents, 6 siblings, 33 health professionals, and 5 teachers. Participants described the process of self-care through four main factors: ""self-care"", ""external settings"", ""family"", and ""management"". Five clusters (themes) were identified: (1) Self-care management (device; consulting); (2) Shift of agency (influencing factors; parents; school); (3) Self-care support (normal life and personal development; multidisciplinary support); (4) Daily self-care maintenance/monitoring; (5) Treatment adherence. Self-care management was mostly relevant for parents of children aged between 6 months and 3 years. CONCLUSION: The self-care process varies according to the needs related to the specific developmental age and the evolution of the clinical condition over time.

Analysis of social media data for public emotion on the Wuhan lockdown event during the COVID-19 pandemic.,Cao G; Shen L; Evans R; Zhang Z; Bi Q; Huang W; Yao R; Zhang W,"BACKGROUND: With outbreaks of COVID-19 around the world, lockdown restrictions are routinely imposed to limit the spread of the virus. During periods of lockdown, social media has become the main channel for citizens to exchange information with others. Public emotions are being generated and shared rapidly online with citizens using internet platforms to reduce anxiety and stress, and stay connected while isolated. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to explore the regularity of emotional evolution by examining public emotions expressed in online discussions about the Wuhan lockdown event in January 2020. METHODS: Data related to the Wuhan lockdown was collected from Sina Weibo by web crawler. In this study, the Ortony, Clore, and Collins (OCC) model, Word2Vec, and Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory model were employed to determine emotional types, train vectorization of words, and identify each text emotion for the training set. Latent Dirichlet Allocation models were also employed to mine the various topic categories, while topic emotional evolution was visualized. RESULTS: Seven types of emotions and four phases were categorized to describe emotional evolution on the Wuhan lockdown event. The study found that negative emotions such as blame and fear dominated in the early days, and public attitudes towards the lockdown gradually alleviated and reached a balance as the situation improved. Emotional expression about Wuhan lockdown event were significantly related to users' gender, location, and whether or not their account was verified. There were statistically significant correlations between different emotions within the subtle emotional categories. In addition, the evolution of emotions presented a different path due to different topics. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple emotional categories were determined in our study, providing a detailed and explainable emotion analysis to explored emotional appeal of citizen. The public emotions were gradually easing related to the Wuhan lockdown event, there yet exists regional discrimination and post-traumatic stress disorder in this process, which would lead us to pay continuous attention to citizens lives and psychological status post-pandemic.

Assistive Conversational Agent for Health Coaching: A Validation Study.,Fadhil A; Wang Y; Reiterer H,"OBJECTIVE: Poor lifestyle represents a health risk factor and is the leading cause of morbidity and chronic conditions. The impact of poor lifestyle can be significantly altered by individual's behavioral modification. Although there are abundant lifestyle promotion applications and tools, they are still limited in providing tailored social support that goes beyond their predefined functionalities. In addition, virtual coaching approaches are still unable to handle user emotional needs. Our approach presents a human-virtual agent mediated system that leverages the conversational agent to handle menial caregiver's works by engaging users (e.g., patients) in a conversation with the conversational agent. The dialog used a natural conversation to interact with users, delivered by the conversational agent and handled with a finite state machine automaton. Our research differs from existing approaches that replace a human coach with a fully automated assistant on user support. The methodology allows users to interact with the technology and access health-related interventions. To assist physicians, the conversational agent gives weighting to user's adherence, based on prior defined conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This article describes the design and validation of CoachAI, a conversational agent-assisted health coaching system to support health intervention delivery to individuals or groups. CoachAI instantiates a text-based health care conversational agent system that bridges the remote human coach and the users. RESULTS: We will discuss our approach and highlight the outcome of a 1-month validation study on physical activity, healthy diet, and stress coping. The study validates technology aspects of our human-virtual agent mediated health coaching system. We present the intervention settings and findings from the study. In addition, we present some user-experience validation results gathered during or after the experimentation. CONCLUSIONS: The study provided a set of dimensions when building a human-conversational agent powered health intervention tool. The results provided interesting insights when using human-conversational agent mediated approach in health coaching systems. The findings revealed that users who were highly engaged were also more adherent to conversational-agent activities. This research made key contributions to the literature on techniques in providing social, yet tailored health coaching support: (1) identifying habitual patterns to understand user preferences; (2) the role of a conversational agent in delivering health promoting microactivities; (3) building the technology while adhering to individuals' daily messaging routine; and (4) a socio-technical system that fits with the role of conversational agent as an assistive component. FUTURE WORK: Future improvements will consider building the activity recommender based on users' interaction data and integrating users' dietary pattern and emotional wellbeing into the initial user clustering by leveraging information and communication technology approaches (e.g., machine learning).

Unraveling the linguistic nature of specific autobiographical memories using a computerized classification algorithm.,Takano K; Ueno M; Moriya J; Mori M; Nishiguchi Y; Raes F,"In the present study, we explored the linguistic nature of specific memories generated with the Autobiographical Memory Test (AMT) by developing a computerized classifier that distinguishes between specific and nonspecific memories. The AMT is regarded as one of the most important assessment tools to study memory dysfunctions (e.g., difficulty recalling the specific details of memories) in psychopathology. In Study 1, we utilized the Japanese corpus data of 12,400 cue-recalled memories tagged with observer-rated specificity. We extracted linguistic features of particular relevance to memory specificity, such as past tense, negation, and adverbial words and phrases pertaining to time and location. On the basis of these features, a support vector machine (SVM) was trained to classify the memories into specific and nonspecific categories, which achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of .92 in a performance test. In Study 2, the trained SVM was tested in terms of its robustness in classifying novel memories (n = 8,478) that were retrieved in response to cue words that were different from those used in Study 1. The SVM showed an AUC of .89 in classifying the new memories. In Study 3, we extended the binary SVM to a five-class classification of the AMT, which achieved 64%-65% classification accuracy, against the chance level (20%) in the performance tests.

"Linguistic markers of autism in girls: evidence of a ""blended phenotype"" during storytelling.",Boorse J; Cola M; Plate S; Yankowitz L; Pandey J; Schultz RT; Parish-Morris J,"BACKGROUND: Narrative abilities are linked to social impairment in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), such that reductions in words about cognitive processes (e.g., think, know) are thought to reflect underlying deficits in social cognition, including Theory of Mind. However, research suggests that typically developing (TD) boys and girls tell narratives in sex-specific ways, including differential reliance on cognitive process words. Given that most studies of narration in ASD have been conducted in predominantly male samples, it is possible that prior results showing reduced cognitive processing language in ASD may not generalize to autistic girls. To answer this question, we measured the relative frequency of two kinds of words in stories told by autistic girls and boys: nouns (words that indicate object-oriented storytelling) and cognitive process words (words like think and know that indicate mentalizing or attention to other peoples' internal states). METHODS: One hundred two verbally fluent school-aged children [girls with ASD (N = 21) and TD (N = 19), and boys with ASD (N = 41) and TD (N = 21)] were matched on age, IQ, and maternal education. Children told a story from a sequence of pictures, and word frequencies (nouns, cognitive process words) were compared. RESULTS: Autistic children of both sexes consistently produced a greater number of nouns than TD controls, indicating object-focused storytelling. There were no sex differences in cognitive process word use in the TD group, but autistic girls produced significantly more cognitive process words than autistic boys, despite comparable autism symptom severity. Thus, autistic girls showed a unique narrative profile that overlapped with autistic boys and typical girls/boys. Noun use correlated significantly with parent reports of social symptom severity in all groups, but cognitive process word use correlated with social ability in boys only. CONCLUSION: This study extends prior research on autistic children's storytelling by measuring sex differences in the narratives of a relatively large, well-matched sample of children with and without ASD. Importantly, prior research showing that autistic children use fewer cognitive process words is true for boys only, while object-focused language is a sex-neutral linguistic marker of ASD. These findings suggest that sex-sensitive screening and diagnostic methods-preferably using objective metrics like natural language processing-may be helpful for identifying autistic girls, and could guide the development of future personalized treatment strategies.",2019,,Mol Autism,10,,14,,10.1186/s13229-019-0268-2,30962869,#8187,Boorse 2019,"",""

Brief, cost-effective cognitive screening instruments are needed to help identify individuals who require further evaluation. This study presents preliminary data on a new screening technology using automated voice recording analysis software in a Spanish population. METHOD: Data were collected from 174 Spanish-speaking individuals clinically diagnosed as cognitively normal (CN, n = 87) or impaired (mild cognitive impairment [MCI], n = 63; all-cause dementia, n = 24). Participants were recorded performing four common language tasks (Animal fluency, alternating fluency [sports and fruits], phonemic ""F"" fluency, and Cookie Theft Description). Recordings were processed via text-transcription and digital-signal processing techniques to capture neuropsychological variables and audio characteristics. A training sample of 122 subjects with similar demographics across groups was used to develop an algorithm to detect cognitive impairment. Speech and task features were used to develop five independent machine learning (ML) models to compute scores between 0 and 1, and a final algorithm was constructed using repeated cross-validation. A socio-demographically balanced subset of 52 participants was used to test the algorithm. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), covarying for demographic characteristics, was used to predict logistically-transformed algorithm scores. RESULTS: Mean logit algorithm scores were significantly different across groups in the testing sample (p < 0.01).

Diary content was analyzed using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count 2015 software (Pennebaker Conglomerates, Inc) and descriptive keyword analyses. The similarities between structured diary data and follow-up survey data on health-related quality of life, symptoms, and medication intake were examined using the Jaccard index. RESULTS: Campaign participants (n=134; diary entries: n=815) were more often women, were not working full time, did not have a higher education degree, had a more advanced gait impairment, and were on average 5 years older (median age 52.5, IQR 43.25-59.75 years) than eligible nonparticipants (median age 47, IQR 38-55 years; n=524). Diary free-text entries (n=632; participants: n=100) most often contained references to the following standard Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count word categories: negative emotion (193/632, 30.5%), body parts or body functioning (191/632, 30.2%), health (94/632, 14.9%), or work (67/632, 10.6%). Analogously, the most frequently mentioned keywords (diary entries: n=526; participants: n=93) were ""good,"" ""day,"" and ""work."" Similarities between diary data and follow-up survey data, collected 14 months apart (median), were high for health-related quality of life and stable for slow-changing symptoms such as fatigue or gait disorder. Similarities were also comparatively high for drugs requiring a regular application, including interferon beta-1a (Avonex) and glatiramer acetate (Copaxone), and for modern oral therapies such as fingolimod (Gilenya) and teriflunomide (Aubagio). CONCLUSIONS: Diary campaign participation seemed dependent on time availability and symptom burden and was enhanced by reminder emails. Electronic health diaries are a meaningful complement to regular structured surveys and can provide more detailed information regarding medication use and symptoms. However, they should ideally be embedded into promotional activities or tied to concrete research study tasks to enhance regular and long-term participation.",2022,Oct,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,10,10,e38709,,10.2196/38709,36197713,#8298,Sieber 2022,"",""
Assessing the needs of patients with breast cancer and their families across various treatment phases using a Latent Dirichlet Allocation model: a text-mining approach to online health communities.,Da C; Duan Y; Ji Z; Chen J; Xia H; Weng Y; Zhou T; Yuan C; Cai T,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess the different needs of patients with breast cancer and their families in online health communities at different treatment phases using a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model. METHODS: Using Python, breast cancer-related posts were collected from two online health communities: patient-to-patient and patient-to-doctor. After data cleaning, eligible posts were categorized based on the treatment phase. Subsequently, an LDA model identifying the distinct need-related topics for each phase of treatment, including data preprocessing and LDA topic modeling, was established. Additionally, the demographic and interactive features of the posts were manually analyzed. RESULTS: We collected 84,043 posts, of which 9504 posts were included after data cleaning. Early diagnosis and rehabilitation treatment phases had the highest and lowest number of posts, respectively. LDA identified 11 topics: three in the initial diagnosis phase and two in each of the remaining treatment phases. The topics included disease outcomes, diagnosis analysis, treatment information, and emotional support in the initial diagnosis phase; surgical options and outcomes, postoperative care, and treatment planning in the perioperative treatment phase; treatment options and costs, side effects management, and disease prognosis assessment in the non-operative treatment phase; diagnosis and treatment options, disease prognosis, and emotional support in the relapse and metastasis treatment phase; and follow-up and recurrence concerns, physical symptoms, and lifestyle adjustments in the rehabilitation treatment phase. CONCLUSION: The needs of patients with breast cancer and their families differ across various phases of cancer therapy. Therefore, specific information or emotional assistance should be tailored to each phase of treatment based on the unique needs of patients and their families.",2024,Apr,Support Care Cancer,32,5,314,,10.1007/s00520-024-08513-3,38683417,#8340,Da 2024,"",""
A regulatory pathway model of neuropsychological disruption in Havana syndrome.,Chacko TP; Toole JT; Morris MC; Page J; Forsten RD; Barrett JP; Reinhard MJ; Brewster RC; Costanzo ME; Broderick G,"INTRODUCTION: In 2016 diplomatic personnel serving in Havana, Cuba, began reporting audible sensory phenomena paired with onset of complex and persistent neurological symptoms consistent with brain injury. The etiology of these Anomalous Health Incidents (AHI) and subsequent symptoms remains unknown. This report investigates putative exposure-symptom pathology by assembling a network model of published bio-behavioral pathways and assessing how dysregulation of such pathways might explain loss of function in these subjects using data available in the published literature. Given similarities in presentation with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), we used the latter as a clinically relevant means of evaluating if the neuropsychological profiles observed in Havana Syndrome Havana Syndrome might be explained at least in part by a dysregulation of neurotransmission, neuro-inflammation, or both. METHOD: Automated text-mining of >9,000 publications produced a network consisting of 273 documented regulatory interactions linking 29 neuro-chemical markers with 9 neuropsychological constructs from the Brief Mood Survey, PTSD Checklist, and the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale. Analysis of information flow through this network produced a set of regulatory rules reconciling to within a 6% departure known mechanistic pathways with neuropsychological profiles in N = 6 subjects. RESULTS: Predicted expression of neuro-chemical markers that jointly satisfy documented pathways and observed symptom profiles display characteristically elevated IL-1B, IL-10, NGF, and norepinephrine levels in the context of depressed BDNF, GDNF, IGF1, and glutamate expression (FDR < 5%). Elevations in CRH and IL-6 were also predicted unanimously across all subjects. Furthermore, simulations of neurological regulatory dynamics reveal subjects do not appear to be ""locked in"" persistent illness but rather appear to be engaged in a slow recovery trajectory. DISCUSSION: This computational analysis of measured neuropsychological symptoms in Havana-based diplomats proposes that these AHI symptoms may be supported in part by disruption of known neuroimmune and neurotransmission regulatory mechanisms also associated with mTBI.",2023,,Front Psychiatry,14,,1180929,,10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1180929,37965360,#8350,Chacko 2023,"",""
Acceptability of collecting speech samples from the elderly via the telephone.,Diaz-Asper C; Chandler C; Turner RS; Reynolds B; Elvevåg B,"OBJECTIVE: There is a critical need to develop rapid, inexpensive and easily accessible screening tools for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We report on the efficacy of collecting speech via the telephone to subsequently develop sensitive metrics that may be used as potential biomarkers by leveraging natural language processing methods. METHODS: Ninety-one older individuals who were cognitively unimpaired or diagnosed with MCI or AD participated from home in an audio-recorded telephone interview, which included a standard cognitive screening tool, and the collection of speech samples. In this paper we address six questions of interest: (1) Will elderly people agree to participate in a recorded telephone interview? (2) Will they complete it? (3) Will they judge it an acceptable approach? (4) Will the speech that is collected over the telephone be of a good quality? (5) Will the speech be intelligible to human raters? (6) Will transcriptions produced by automated speech recognition accurately reflect the speech produced? RESULTS: Participants readily agreed to participate in the telephone interview, completed it in its entirety, and rated the approach as acceptable. Good quality speech was produced for further analyses to be applied, and almost all recorded words were intelligible for human transcription. Not surprisingly, human transcription outperformed off the shelf automated speech recognition software, but further investigation into automated speech recognition shows promise for its usability in future work. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that collecting speech samples from elderly individuals via the telephone is well tolerated, practical, and inexpensive, and produces good quality data for uses such as natural language processing.",2021,Jan-Dec,Digit Health,7,,20552076211002103,,10.1177/20552076211002103,33953936,#8394,Diaz-Asper 2021,"",""
Understanding public perception of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) social distancing on Twitter.,Saleh SN; Lehmann CU; McDonald SA; Basit MA; Medford RJ,"OBJECTIVE: Social distancing policies are key in curtailing severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread, but their effectiveness is heavily contingent on public understanding and collective adherence. We studied public perception of social distancing through organic, large-scale discussion on Twitter. DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional study. METHODS: Between March 27 and April 10, 2020, we retrieved English-only tweets matching two trending social distancing hashtags, #socialdistancing and #stayathome. We analyzed the tweets using natural language processing and machine-learning models, and we conducted a sentiment analysis to identify emotions and polarity. We evaluated the subjectivity of tweets and estimated the frequency of discussion of social distancing rules. We then identified clusters of discussion using topic modeling and associated sentiments. RESULTS: We studied a sample of 574,903 tweets. For both hashtags, polarity was positive (mean, 0.148; SD, 0.290); only 15% of tweets had negative polarity. Tweets were more likely to be objective (median, 0.40; IQR, 0-0.6) with ~30% of tweets labeled as completely objective (labeled as 0 in range from 0 to 1). Approximately half of tweets (50.4%) primarily expressed joy and one-fifth expressed fear and surprise. Each correlated well with topic clusters identified by frequency including leisure and community support (ie, joy), concerns about food insecurity and quarantine effects (ie, fear), and unpredictability of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its implications (ie, surprise).

COVID-19 information fatigue? A case study of a German university website during two waves of the pandemic.,Skulmowski A; Standl B,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the ubiquity of health-related information, disseminated using digital technology. However, recent research suggests that this accessibility of (often negative) information can induce adverse psychological effects, including anxiety, panic-based hoarding, and other unhealthy behaviors. Some of these consequences have been explained with the idea of an information overload. Considering these current developments, it may become harder to effectively communicate COVID-19-related information in smaller, local contexts, such as universities. By analyzing the page views and searches on the website of a university of education in Germany, we derive recommendations for the delivery of information of local organizations. One conclusion is that the need for information during the pandemic decreases as time passes (at least at the local level of institutions such as universities), and even new emergencies such as the beginning of the second wave of COVID-19 only affect this behavioral pattern to a minor extent. As a result of this COVID-19 information fatigue, strategies to keep members of institutions informed are discussed. In addition, we suggest developing a mobile app for delivering individualized information right on hand using machine learning and natural language processing strategies. In sum, individual organizations interested in keeping their members informed concerning COVID-19 should consider the use of personalized information strategies that avoid inducing negative emotional states. Moreover, potentials for connecting people using digital technology could be harnessed in local organizations.",2021,Jul,Hum Behav Emerg Technol,3,3,350-356,,10.1002/hbe2.260,34222832,#8477,Skulmowski 2021,"",""
Psilocybin-Induced Mystical-Type Experiences are Related to Persisting Positive Effects: A Quantitative and Qualitative Report.,McCulloch DE; Grzywacz MZ; Madsen MK; Jensen PS; Ozenne B; Armand S; Knudsen GM; Fisher PM; Stenbæk DS,"Psychedelic drugs such as psilocybin have shown substantial promise for the treatment of several psychiatric conditions including mood and addictive disorders. They also have the remarkable property of producing persisting positive psychological changes in healthy volunteers for at least several months. In this study (NCT03289949), 35 medium-high doses of psilocybin were administered to 28 healthy volunteers (12 females). By the end of the dosing day, participants reported the intensity of their acute experience using the 30-item Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ) and an open-form qualitative report from home. Persisting psychological effects attributed to the psilocybin experience were measured using the Persisting Effects Questionnaire (PEQ) 3-months after administration. Using a linear latent-variable model we show that the MEQ total score is positively associated with the later emergence of positive PEQ effects (p = 3 × 10(-5)). Moreover, the MEQ subscales ""Positive Mood"" (p(corr) = 4.1 × 10(-4)) and ""Mysticality"" (p(corr) = 2.0 × 10(-4)) are associated with positive PEQ whereas the subscales ""Transcendence of Time and Space"" (p(corr) = 0.38) and ""Ineffability"" (p(corr) = 0.45) are not. Using natural language pre-processing, we provide the first qualitative descriptions of the ""Complete Mystical Experience"" induced by orally administered psilocybin in healthy volunteers, revealing themes such as a sense of connection with the Universe, familial love, and the experience of profound beauty.

Mapping Individual Differences on the Internet: Case Study of the Type 1 Diabetes Community.,Bedford-Petersen C; Weston SJ,"BACKGROUND: Social media platforms, such as Twitter, are increasingly popular among communities of people with chronic conditions, including those with type 1 diabetes (T1D). There is some evidence that social media confers emotional and health-related benefits to people with T1D, including emotional support and practical information regarding health maintenance. Research on social media has primarily relied on self-reports of web-based behavior and qualitative assessment of web-based content, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Meanwhile, recent advances in natural language processing have allowed for large-scale assessment of social media behavior. OBJECTIVE: This study attempts to document the major themes of Twitter posts using a natural language processing method to identify topics of interest in the T1D web-based community. We also seek to map social relations on Twitter as they relate to these topics of interest, to determine whether Twitter users in the T1D community post in ""echo chambers,"" which reflect their own topics back to them, or whether users typically see a mix of topics on the internet. METHODS: Through Twitter scraping, we gathered a data set of 691,691 tweets from 8557 accounts, spanning a date range from 2008 to 2020, which includes people with T1D, their caregivers, health practitioners, and advocates. Tweet content was analyzed for sentiment and topic, using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. We used social network analysis to examine the degree to which identified topics are siloed within specific groups or disseminated through the broader T1D web-based community. RESULTS: Tweets were, on average, positive in sentiment. Through topic modeling, we identified 6 broad-bandwidth topics, ranging from clinical to advocacy to daily management to emotional health, which can inform researchers and practitioners interested in the needs of people with T1D. These analyses also replicate prior work using machine learning methods to map social behavior on the internet. We extend these results through social network analysis, indicating that users are likely to see a mix of these topics discussed by the accounts they follow. CONCLUSIONS: Twitter communities are sources of information for people with T1D and members related to that community. Topics identified reveal key concerns of the T1D community and may be useful to practitioners and researchers alike. The methods used are efficient (low cost) while providing researchers with enormous amounts of data. We provide code to facilitate the use of these methods with other populations.",2021,Oct,JMIR Diabetes,6,4,e30756,,10.2196/30756,34652277,#8536,Bedford-Petersen 2021,"",""
Public Perception of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Twitter: Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling Study.,Boon-Itt S; Skunkan Y,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a scientifically and medically novel disease that is not fully understood because it has yet to be consistently and deeply studied. Among the gaps in research on the COVID-19 outbreak, there is a lack of sufficient infoveillance data. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to increase understanding of public awareness of COVID-19 pandemic trends and uncover meaningful themes of concern posted by Twitter users in the English language during the pandemic. METHODS: Data mining was conducted on Twitter to collect a total of 107,990 tweets related to COVID-19 between December 13 and March 9, 2020. The analyses included frequency of keywords, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling to identify and explore discussion topics over time. A natural language processing approach and the latent Dirichlet allocation algorithm were used to identify the most common tweet topics as well as to categorize clusters and identify themes based on the keyword analysis. RESULTS: The results indicate three main aspects of public awareness and concern regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. First, the trend of the spread and symptoms of COVID-19 can be divided into three stages. Second, the results of the sentiment analysis showed that people have a negative outlook toward COVID-19. Third, based on topic modeling, the themes relating to COVID-19 and the outbreak were divided into three categories: the COVID-19 pandemic emergency, how to control COVID-19, and reports on COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Sentiment analysis and topic modeling can produce useful information about the trends in the discussion of the COVID-19 pandemic on social media as well as alternative perspectives to investigate the COVID-19 crisis, which has created considerable public awareness.

Identification of risk factors for the onset of delirium associated with COVID-19 by mining nursing records.,Miyazawa Y; Katsuta N; Nara T; Nojiri S; Naito T; Hiki M; Ichikawa M; Takeshita Y; Kato T; Okumura M; Tobita M,"COVID-19 has a range of complications, from no symptoms to severe pneumonia. It can also affect multiple organs including the nervous system. COVID-19 affects the brain, leading to neurological symptoms such as delirium. Delirium, a sudden change in consciousness, can increase the risk of death and prolong the hospital stay. However, research on delirium prediction in patients with COVID-19 is insufficient. This study aimed to identify new risk factors that could predict the onset of delirium in patients with COVID-19 using machine learning (ML) applied to nursing records. This retrospective cohort study used natural language processing and ML to develop a model for classifying the nursing records of patients with delirium. We extracted the features of each word from the model and grouped similar words. To evaluate the usefulness of word groups in predicting the occurrence of delirium in patients with COVID-19, we analyzed the temporal changes in the frequency of occurrence of these word groups before and after the onset of delirium. Moreover, the sensitivity, specificity, and odds ratios were calculated. We identified (1) elimination-related behaviors and conditions and (2) abnormal patient behavior and conditions as risk factors for delirium. Group 1 had the highest sensitivity (0.603), whereas group 2 had the highest specificity and odds ratio (0.938 and 6.903, respectively). These results suggest that these parameters may be useful in predicting delirium in these patients. The risk factors for COVID-19-associated delirium identified in this study were more specific but less sensitive than the ICDSC (Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist) and CAM-ICU (Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit). However, they are superior to the ICDSC and CAM-ICU because they can predict delirium without medical staff and at no cost.",2024,,PLoS One,19,1,e0296760,,10.1371/journal.pone.0296760,38241284,#8551,Miyazawa 2024,"",""
Methadone and suboxone(®) mentions on twitter: thematic and sentiment analysis.,Chenworth M; Perrone J; Love JS; Graves R; Hogg-Bremer W; Sarker A,"BACKGROUND: According to the latest medical evidence, Methadone and buprenorphine-naloxone (Suboxone(®)) are effective treatments for opioid use disorder (OUD). While the evidence basis for the use of these medications is favorable, less is known about the perceptions of the general public about them. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to use Twitter to assess the public perceptions about methadone and buprenorphine-naloxone, and to compare their discussion contents based on themes/topics, subthemes, and sentiment. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive analysis of a small and automatic analysis of a large volume of microposts (""tweets"") that mentioned ""methadone"" or ""suboxone"". In the manual analysis, we categorized the tweets into themes and subthemes, as well as by sentiment and personal experience, and compared the information posted about these two medications. We performed automatic topic modeling and sentiment analysis over large volumes of posts and compared the outputs to those from the manual analyses. RESULTS: We manually analyzed 900 tweets, most of which related to access (15.3% for methadone; 14.3% for buprenorphine-naloxone), stigma (17.0%; 15.5%), and OUD treatment (12.8%; 15.6%). Only a small proportion of tweets (16.4% for Suboxone(®) and 9.3% for methadone) expressed positive sentiments about the medications, with few tweets describing personal experiences. Tweets mentioning both medications primarily discussed MOUD broadly, rather than comparing the two medications directly. Automatic topic modeling revealed topics from the larger dataset that corresponded closely to the manually identified themes, but sentiment analysis did not reveal any notable differences in chatter regarding the two medications. CONCLUSIONS: Twitter content about methadone and Suboxone(®) is similar, with the same major themes and similar sub-themes. Despite the proven effectiveness of these medications, there was little dialogue related to their benefits or efficacy in the treatment of OUD.

Our objective was to develop, evaluate, and validate an automated algorithm for determining an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) patient cohort from EHR. We demonstrate its utility via the largest investigation to date of the co-occurrence patterns of medical comorbidities in ASD. METHODS: We extracted ICD-9 codes and concepts derived from the clinical notes. A gold standard patient set was labeled by clinicians at Boston Children's Hospital (BCH) (N = 150) and Cincinnati Children's Hospital and Medical Center (CCHMC) (N = 152). Two algorithms were created: (1) rule-based implementing the ASD criteria from Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Diseases 4th edition, (2) predictive classifier. The positive predictive values (PPV) achieved by these algorithms were compared to an ICD-9 code baseline. We clustered the patients based on grouped ICD-9 codes and evaluated subgroups. RESULTS: The rule-based algorithm produced the best PPV: (a) BCH: 0.885 vs. 0.273 (baseline); (b) CCHMC: 0.840 vs. 0.645 (baseline); (c) combined: 0.864 vs. 0.460 (baseline). A validation at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia yielded 0.848 (PPV). Clustering analyses of comorbidities on the three-site large cohort (N = 20,658 ASD patients) identified psychiatric, developmental, and seizure disorder clusters.

Usability and Credibility of a COVID-19 Vaccine Chatbot for Young Adults and Health Workers in the United States: Formative Mixed Methods Study.,Weeks R; Sangha P; Cooper L; Sedoc J; White S; Gretz S; Toledo A; Lahav D; Hartner AM; Martin NM; Lee JH; Slonim N; Bar-Zeev N,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic raised novel challenges in communicating reliable, continually changing health information to a broad and sometimes skeptical public, particularly around COVID-19 vaccines, which, despite being comprehensively studied, were the subject of viral misinformation. Chatbots are a promising technology to reach and engage populations during the pandemic. To inform and communicate effectively with users, chatbots must be highly usable and credible. OBJECTIVE: We sought to understand how young adults and health workers in the United States assessed the usability and credibility of a web-based chatbot called Vira, created by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and IBM Research using natural language processing technology. Using a mixed method approach, we sought to rapidly improve Vira's user experience to support vaccine decision-making during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We recruited racially and ethnically diverse young people and health workers, with both groups from urban areas of the United States. We used the validated Chatbot Usability Questionnaire to understand the tool's navigation, precision, and persona. We also conducted 11 interviews with health workers and young people to understand the user experience, whether they perceived the chatbot as confidential and trustworthy, and how they would use the chatbot. We coded and categorized emerging themes to understand the determining factors for participants' assessment of chatbot usability and credibility. RESULTS: In all, 58 participants completed a web-based usability questionnaire and 11 completed in-depth interviews. Most questionnaire respondents said the chatbot was ""easy to navigate"" (51/58, 88%) and ""very easy to use"" (50/58, 86%), and many (45/58, 78%) said its responses were relevant. The mean Chatbot Usability Questionnaire score was 70.2 (SD 12.1) and scores ranged from 40.6 to 95.3. Interview participants felt the chatbot achieved high usability due to its strong functionality, performance, and perceived confidentiality and that the chatbot could attain high credibility with a redesign of its cartoonish visual persona. Young people said they would use the chatbot to discuss vaccination with hesitant friends or family members, whereas health workers used or anticipated using the chatbot to support community outreach, save time, and stay up to date. CONCLUSIONS: This formative study conducted during the pandemic's peak provided user feedback for an iterative redesign of Vira. Using a mixed method approach provided multidimensional feedback, identifying how the chatbot worked well-being easy to use, answering questions appropriately, and using credible branding-while offering tangible steps to improve the product's visual design. Future studies should evaluate how chatbots support personal health decision-making, particularly in the context of a public health emergency, and whether such outreach tools can reduce staff burnout.

Eliciting and receiving online support: using computer-aided content analysis to examine the dynamics of online social support.,Wang YC; Kraut RE; Levine JM,"BACKGROUND: Although many people with serious diseases participate in online support communities, little research has investigated how participants elicit and provide social support on these sites. OBJECTIVE: The first goal was to propose and test a model of the dynamic process through which participants in online support communities elicit and provide emotional and informational support. The second was to demonstrate the value of computer coding of conversational data using machine learning techniques (1) by replicating results derived from human-coded data about how people elicit support and (2) by answering questions that are intractable with small samples of human-coded data, namely how exposure to different types of social support predicts continued participation in online support communities. The third was to provide a detailed description of these machine learning techniques to enable other researchers to perform large-scale data analysis in these communities. METHODS: Communication among approximately 90,000 registered users of an online cancer support community was analyzed. The corpus comprised 1,562,459 messages organized into 68,158 discussion threads. Amazon Mechanical Turk workers coded (1) 1000 thread-starting messages on 5 attributes (positive and negative emotional self-disclosure, positive and negative informational self-disclosure, questions) and (2) 1000 replies on emotional and informational support. Their judgments were used to train machine learning models that automatically estimated the amount of these 7 attributes in the messages. Across attributes, the average Pearson correlation between human-based judgments and computer-based judgments was .65. RESULTS: Part 1 used human-coded data to investigate relationships between (1) 4 kinds of self-disclosure and question asking in thread-starting posts and (2) the amount of emotional and informational support in the first reply. Self-disclosure about negative emotions (beta=.24, P<.001), negative events (beta=.25, P<.001), and positive events (beta=.10, P=.02) increased emotional support. However, asking questions depressed emotional support (beta=-.21, P<.001). In contrast, asking questions increased informational support (beta=.38, P<.001), whereas positive informational self-disclosure depressed it (beta=-.09, P=.003). Self-disclosure led to the perception of emotional needs, which elicited emotional support, whereas asking questions led to the perception of informational needs, which elicited informational support. Part 2 used machine-coded data to replicate these results. Part 3 analyzed the machine-coded data and showed that exposure to more emotional support predicted staying in the group longer 33% (hazard ratio=0.67, P<.001), whereas exposure to more informational support predicted leaving the group sooner (hazard ratio=1.05, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Self-disclosure is effective in eliciting emotional support, whereas question asking is effective in eliciting informational support.

Comparison of the Users' Attitudes Toward Cannabidiol on Social Media Platforms: Topic Modeling Study.,Li Y; Yan X; Wang Z; Ma M; Zhang B; Jia Z,"BACKGROUND: As one of the major constituents of the cannabis sativa plant, cannabidiol (CBD) is approved for use in medical treatment and cosmetics because of its potential health benefits. With the rapid growth of the CBD market, customers purchase these products, and relevant discussions are becoming more active on social media. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to understand the users' attitudes toward CBD products in various countries by conducting text mining on social media in countries with different substance management policies. METHODS: We collected posts from Reddit and Xiaohongshu, conducted topic mining using the latent Dirichlet allocation model, and analyzed the characteristics of topics on different social media. Subsequently, a co-occurrence network of high-frequency keywords was constructed to explore potential relationships among topics. Moreover, we conducted sentiment analysis on the posts' comments and compared users' attitudes toward CBD products on Reddit and Xiaohongshu using chi-square test. RESULTS: CBD-related posts on social media have been rapidly increasing, especially on Xiaohongshu since 2019. A total of 1790 posts from Reddit and 1951 posts from Xiaohongshu were included in the final analysis. The posts on the 2 social media platforms, Reddit and Xiaohongshu, were categorized into 7 and 8 topics, respectively, by the latent Dirichlet allocation model, and these topics on the 2 social media were grouped into 5 themes. Our study showed that the themes on Reddit were mainly related to the therapeutic effects of CBD, whereas the themes on Xiaohongshu concentrated on cosmetics, such as facial masks. Theme 2 (CBD market information) and theme 3 (attitudes toward CBD) on Reddit had more connections with other themes in the co-occurrence network, and theme 3 and theme 1 (CBD therapeutic effects) had a high co-occurrence frequency (22,803/73,865, 30.87%). Meanwhile, theme 1 (CBD cosmetics) on Xiaohongshu had various connections with others (169,961/384,575, 44.19%), and the co-occurrence frequency of theme 4 (CBD ingredients) and theme 1 was relatively prominent (27,128/49,312, 55.01%). Overall, users' comments tended to be positive for CBD-related information on both Reddit and Xiaohongshu, but the percentage was higher on Xiaohongshu (82.25% vs 86.18%; P<.001), especially in cosmetics and medical health care products. CONCLUSIONS: The CBD market has grown rapidly, and the topics related to CBD on social media have become active. There are apparent differences in users' attitudes toward CBD in countries with different substance management policies. Targeted CBD management measures should be formulated to suit the prevalence of CBD use of each country.",2023,Jan,JMIR Public Health Surveill,9,,e34132,,10.2196/34132,36630175,#8613,Li 2023,"",""
Multilingual Framework for Risk Assessment and Symptom Tracking (MRAST).,Šafran V; Lin S; Nateqi J; Martin AG; Smrke U; Ariöz U; Plohl N; Rojc M; Bēma D; Chávez M; Horvat M; Mlakar I,"The importance and value of real-world data in healthcare cannot be overstated because it offers a valuable source of insights into patient experiences. Traditional patient-reported experience and outcomes measures (PREMs/PROMs) often fall short in addressing the complexities of these experiences due to subjectivity and their inability to precisely target the questions asked. In contrast, diary recordings offer a promising solution. They can provide a comprehensive picture of psychological well-being, encompassing both psychological and physiological symptoms. This study explores how using advanced digital technologies, i.e., automatic speech recognition and natural language processing, can efficiently capture patient insights in oncology settings. We introduce the MRAST framework, a simplified way to collect, structure, and understand patient data using questionnaires and diary recordings. The framework was validated in a prospective study with 81 colorectal and 85 breast cancer survivors, of whom 37 were male and 129 were female. Overall, the patients evaluated the solution as well made; they found it easy to use and integrate into their daily routine. The majority (75.3%) of the cancer survivors participating in the study were willing to engage in health monitoring activities using digital wearable devices daily for an extended period. Throughout the study, there was a noticeable increase in the number of participants who perceived the system as having excellent usability. Despite some negative feedback, 44.44% of patients still rated the app's usability as above satisfactory (i.e., 7.9 on 1-10 scale) and the experience with diary recording as above satisfactory (i.e., 7.0 on 1-10 scale). Overall, these findings also underscore the significance of user testing and continuous improvement in enhancing the usability and user acceptance of solutions like the MRAST framework. Overall, the automated extraction of information from diaries represents a pivotal step toward a more patient-centered approach, where healthcare decisions are based on real-world experiences and tailored to individual needs. The potential usefulness of such data is enormous, as it enables better measurement of everyday experiences and opens new avenues for patient-centered care.",2024,Feb,Sensors (Basel),24,4,,,10.3390/s24041101,38400259,#8622,Šafran 2024,"",""
More than a biomarker: could language be a biosocial marker of psychosis?,Palaniyappan L,"Automated extraction of quantitative linguistic features has the potential to predict objectively the onset and progression of psychosis. These linguistic variables are often considered to be biomarkers, with a large emphasis placed on the pathological aberrations in the biological processes that underwrite the faculty of language in psychosis. This perspective offers a reminder that human language is primarily a social device that is biologically implemented. As such, linguistic aberrations in patients with psychosis reflect both social and biological processes affecting an individual. Failure to consider the sociolinguistic aspects of NLP measures will limit their usefulness as digital tools in clinical settings. In the context of psychosis, considering language as a biosocial marker could lead to less biased and more accessible tools for patient-specific predictions in the clinic.",2021,Aug,NPJ Schizophr,7,1,42,,10.1038/s41537-021-00172-1,34465778,#8632,Palaniyappan 2021,"",""
Associated mortality risk of atypical antipsychotic medication in individuals with dementia.,Phiri P; Engelthaler T; Carr H; Delanerolle G; Holmes C; Rathod S,"BACKGROUND: Antipsychotic medications such as risperidone, olanzapine and aripiprazole are used to treat psychological and behavioural symptoms among dementia patients. Current evidence indicate prescription rates for antipsychotics vary and wider consensus to evaluate clinical epidemiological outcomes is limited. AIM: To investigate the potential impact of atypical antipsychotics on the mortality of patients with dementia. METHODS: A retrospective clinical cohort study was developed to review United Kingdom Clinical Record Interactive Search system based data between January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2017. A descriptive statistical method was used to analyse the data. Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were used to assess the severity and stage of disease progression. A cox proportional hazards model was developed to evaluate the relationship between survival following diagnosis and other variables. RESULTS: A total of 1692 patients were identified using natural language processing of which, 587 were prescribed olanzapine, quetiapine or risperidone (common group) whilst 893 (control group) were not prescribed any antipsychotics. Patients prescribed olanzapine showed an increased risk of death [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08-1.60; P < 0.01], as did those with risperidone (HR = 1.35; 95%CI: 1.18-1.54; P < 0.001). Patients prescribed quetiapine showed no significant association (HR = 1.09; 95%CI: 0.90-1.34; P = 0.38). Factors associated with a lower risk of death were: High MMSE score at diagnosis (HR = 0.72; 95%CI: 0.62-0.83; P < 0.001), identifying as female (HR = 0.73; 95%CI: 0.64-0.82; P < 0.001), and being of a White-British ethnic group (HR = 0.82; 95%CI: 0.72-0.94; P < 0.01).

Multi-locus genome-wide association analysis supports the role of glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the etiology of major depressive disorder.,Lee PH; Perlis RH; Jung JY; Byrne EM; Rueckert E; Siburian R; Haddad S; Mayerfeld CE; Heath AC; Pergadia ML; Madden PA; Boomsma DI; Penninx BW; Sklar P; Martin NG; Wray NR; Purcell SM; Smoller JW,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common psychiatric illness characterized by low mood and loss of interest in pleasurable activities. Despite years of effort, recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified few susceptibility variants or genes that are robustly associated with MDD. Standard single-SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism)-based GWAS analysis typically has limited power to deal with the extensive heterogeneity and substantial polygenic contribution of individually weak genetic effects underlying the pathogenesis of MDD. Here, we report an alternative, gene-set-based association analysis of MDD in an effort to identify groups of biologically related genetic variants that are involved in the same molecular function or cellular processes and exhibit a significant level of aggregated association with MDD. In particular, we used a text-mining-based data analysis to prioritize candidate gene sets implicated in MDD and conducted a multi-locus association analysis to look for enriched signals of nominally associated MDD susceptibility loci within each of the gene sets. Our primary analysis is based on the meta-analysis of three large MDD GWAS data sets (total N=4346 cases and 4430 controls). After correction for multiple testing, we found that genes involved in glutamatergic synaptic neurotransmission were significantly associated with MDD (set-based association P=6.9 × 10(-4)). This result is consistent with previous studies that support a role of the glutamatergic system in synaptic plasticity and MDD and support the potential utility of targeting glutamatergic neurotransmission in the treatment of MDD.",2012,Nov,Transl Psychiatry,2,11,e184,,10.1038/tp.2012.95,23149448,#8723,Lee 2012,"",""
A Hybrid BERT-CNN Approach for Depression Detection on Social Media Using Multimodal Data,"Beniwal, R.; Saraswat, P.","Due to the absence of early facilities, a large population is dealing with stress, anxiety, and depression issues, which may have disastrous consequences, including suicide. Past studies revealed a direct relationship between the high engagement with social media and the increasing depression rate. This research initially creates a dataset with text, emoticons and image data, and then preprocessing is performed using diverse techniques. The proposed model in the research consists of three parts: first is textual bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), which is trained on only text data and also emoticons are converted into a textual form for easy processing; second is convolutional neural network (CNN), which is trained only on image data; and the third is the combination of best-performing models, i.e. hybrid of BERT and CNN (BERT-CNN), to work on both the text and images with enhanced accuracy. The results show the best accuracy with BERT, i.e. 97% for text data; for image data, CNN has attained the highest accuracy of 89%.

The classification of emotions is further enhanced using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model because of its propensity to capture local patterns and its recent triumphs in text-related tasks. The integration of CNN with word embedding techniques introduced an additional layer to the landscape of emotion detection from text. The synergy between word embedding techniques and CNN harnesses the strengths of both approaches.

Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) drafts of patient messages could potentially reduce health care professional (HCP) workload and improve communication quality, but only if the drafts are considered useful. Objectives: To assess PCPs' perceptions of GenAI drafts and to examine linguistic characteristics associated with equity and perceived empathy. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional quality improvement study tested the hypothesis that PCPs' ratings of GenAI drafts (created using the electronic health record [EHR] standard prompts) would be equivalent to HCP-generated responses on 3 dimensions. The study was conducted at NYU Langone Health using private patient-HCP communications at 3 internal medicine practices piloting GenAI. Exposures: Randomly assigned patient messages coupled with either an HCP message or the draft GenAI response. Main Outcomes and Measures: PCPs rated responses' information content quality (eg, relevance), using a Likert scale, communication quality (eg, verbosity), using a Likert scale, and whether they would use the draft or start anew (usable vs unusable). Branching logic further probed for empathy, personalization, and professionalism of responses. Computational linguistics methods assessed content differences in HCP vs GenAI responses, focusing on equity and empathy. Results: A total of 16 PCPs (8 [50.0%] female) reviewed 344 messages (175 GenAI drafted; 169 HCP drafted). Both GenAI and HCP responses were rated favorably. GenAI responses were rated higher for communication style than HCP responses (mean [SD], 3.70 [1.15] vs 3.38 [1.20]; P = .01, U = 12 568.5) but were similar to HCPs on information content (mean [SD], 3.53 [1.26] vs 3.41 [1.27]; P = .37; U = 13 981.0) and usable draft proportion (mean [SD], 0.69 [0.48] vs 0.65 [0.47], P = .49, t = -0.6842). Usable GenAI responses were considered more empathetic than usable HCP responses (32 of 86 [37.2%] vs 13 of 79 [16.5%]; difference, 125.5%), possibly attributable to more subjective (mean [SD], 0.54 [0.16] vs 0.31 [0.23]; P < .001; difference, 74.2%) and positive (mean [SD] polarity, 0.21 [0.14] vs 0.13 [0.25]; P = .02; difference, 61.5%) language; they were also numerically longer (mean [SD] word count, 90.5 [32.0] vs 65.4 [62.6]; difference, 38.4%), but the difference was not statistically significant (P = .07) and more linguistically complex (mean [SD] score, 125.2 [47.8] vs 95.4 [58.8]; P = .002; difference, 31.2%). Conclusions: In this cross-sectional study of PCP perceptions of an EHR-integrated GenAI chatbot, GenAI was found to communicate information better and with more empathy than HCPs, highlighting its potential to enhance patient-HCP communication.

Towards Reliable Healthcare LLM Agents: A Case Study for Pilgrims during Hajj,"Alghamdi, H.M.; Mostafa, A.","There is a pressing need for healthcare conversational agents with domain-specific expertise to ensure the provision of accurate and reliable information tailored to specific medical contexts. Moreover, there is a notable gap in research ensuring the credibility and trustworthiness of the information provided by these healthcare agents, particularly in critical scenarios such as medical emergencies. Pilgrims come from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds, often facing difficulties in accessing medical advice and information. Establishing an AI-powered multilingual chatbot can bridge this gap by providing readily available medical guidance and support, contributing to the well-being and safety of pilgrims. In this paper, we present a comprehensive methodology aimed at enhancing the reliability and efficacy of healthcare conversational agents, with a specific focus on addressing the needs of Hajj pilgrims.

Advanced deep learning and large language models for suicide ideation detection on social media,"Qorich, M.; El Ouazzani, R.","Recently, suicide ideations represent a worldwide health concern and pose many anticipation challenges. Actually, the prevalence of expressing self-destructive thoughts especially on forums and social media requires effective monitoring for suicide prevention, and early intervention. Meanwhile, deep learning techniques and Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools in diverse Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including sentiment analysis and text classification. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model incorporating triple models of word embeddings, as well as various fine-tuned LLMs, to identify suicidal thoughts in Reddit posts. In effect, we implemented a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to categorize posts associated with non-suicidal and suicidal thoughts. Besides, through the combination of Word2Vec, FastText and GloVe embeddings, our models learn intricate patterns and prevalent nuances in suicide-related language. Furthermore, we employed a merged version of CNN and BiLSTM models, entitled C-BiLSTM, and several LLMs, including pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) models and a Generative Pre-training Transformer (GPT) model. The analysis of all our proposed models shows that our C-BiLSTM model with triple word embedding and our GPT model got the best performance compared to deep learning and LLMs baseline models, reaching accuracies of 94.5% and 97.69%, respectively. In fact, our best model’s capacity to extract meaningful interdependencies among words significantly promotes its classification performance.

This paper aimed to automatically identify depression-related topics in speech recordings collected from clinical samples. Methods: The data included 3919 English free-response speech recordings collected via smartphones from 265 participants with a depression history. We transcribed speech recordings via automatic speech recognition (Whisper tool, OpenAI) and identified principal topics from transcriptions using a deep learning topic model (BERTopic). To identify depression risk topics and understand the context, we compared participants' depression severity and behavioral (extracted from wearable devices) and linguistic (extracted from transcribed texts) characteristics across identified topics. Results: From the 29 topics identified, we identified 6 risk topics for depression: ‘No Expectations’, ‘Sleep’, ‘Mental Therapy’, ‘Haircut’, ‘Studying’, and ‘Coursework’. Participants mentioning depression risk topics exhibited higher sleep variability, later sleep onset, and fewer daily steps and used fewer words, more negative language, and fewer leisure-related words in their speech recordings. Limitations: Our findings were derived from a depressed cohort with a specific speech task, potentially limiting the generalizability to non-clinical populations or other speech tasks. Additionally, some topics had small sample sizes, necessitating further validation in larger datasets. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that specific speech topics can indicate depression severity.

Comparative performance of ensemble machine learning for Arabic cyberbullying and offensive language detection,"Khairy, M.; Mahmoud, T.M.; Omar, A.; Abd El-Hafeez, T.","Since cyberbullying impacts both individual victims and entire society, research on abusive language and its detection has attracted attention in recent years. Because social media sites like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and others are so widely accessible, hate speech, bullying, sexism, racism, aggressive material, harassment, poisonous comments, and other types of abuse have all substantially increased. Due to the critical requirement to detect, regulate, and limit the spread of harmful content on social networking sites, we conducted this study to automate the detection of offensive language or cyberbullying. We created a new Arabic balanced data set to be used in the offensive detection process because having a balanced data set for a model would result in improved accuracy models. Recently, the performance of single classifiers has been improved using ensemble machine learning. The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of several single and ensemble machine learning algorithms in identifying Arabic text that contains foul language and cyberbullying. Applying them to three Arabic datasets, we have selected three machine learning classifiers and three ensemble models for this aim. Two of them are offensive datasets that are readily accessible in the public, while the third one was created.

Exploring the Algorithm for Diagnosing Burnout of Counselors in Higher Vocational Colleges in Guangdong Province Based on Emotion Recognition,"Dang, R.; Samad, N.A.","The main objective of the research is to deal with the drawbacks of conventional self-report tests by designing and validating a novel Emotion Recognition (ER) algorithm for assessing Counsellor Burnout (CB) in Higher Vocational Colleges (HVC) in Guangdong Province. Applying the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) Survey Questionnaires, voice and facial expression files, and text analysis of counselling sessions, researchers collected an enormous dataset from 97 counsellors. The study employed a multimodal fusion layer to integrate multiple neural network architectures, namely RNNs for audio content, CNNs for video content, and a BERT+LSTM hybrid for textual analysis. This enabl ed a thorough examination of each ER. By dramatically exhibiting an accuracy of more than 92% for identifying the symptoms of burnout, this method is better than the conventional methods that have been used in previous years. The technique, which successfully recognizes complex, real-time emotions that are frequently ignored when individuals communicate emotions in person, can be used to obtain a more accurate and expert evaluation of burnout because of its capacity to recognize these reactions accurately. Different sources of data and contemporary Machine Learning (ML) methods have enhanced CB prediction and observation. This approach enhances counsellors' emotional stability and assists in developing pedagogical mental health interventions. Findings demonstrate that ML techniques may enhance mental assessment and counselling in demanding employment. © 2024, Transnational Press London Ltd. All rights reserved.",2024,,Int. J.

Evaluation of Code Generation for Simulating Participant Behavior in Experience Sampling Method by Iterative In-Context Learning of a Large Language Model,"Khanshan, A.; Van Gorp, P.; Markopoulos, P.","The Experience Sampling Method (ESM) is commonly used to understand behaviors, thoughts, and feelings in the wild by collecting self-reports. Sustaining sufficient response rates, especially in long-running studies remains challenging. To avoid low response rates and dropouts, experimenters rely on their experience, proposed methodologies from earlier studies, trial and error, or the scarcely available participant behavior data from previous ESM protocols. This approach often fails in finding the acceptable study parameters, resulting in redesigning the protocol and repeating the experiment. Research has shown the potential of machine learning to personalize ESM protocols such that ESM prompts are delivered at opportune moments, leading to higher response rates. The corresponding training process is hindered due to the scarcity of open data in the ESM domain, causing a cold start, which could be mitigated by simulating participant behavior. Such simulations provide training data and insights for the experimenters to update their study design choices. Creating this simulation requires behavioral science, psychology, and programming expertise. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as facilitators for information inquiry and programming, albeit random and occasionally unreliable. We aspire to assess the readiness of LLMs in an ESM use case. We conducted research using GPT-3.5 turbo-16k to tackle an ESM simulation problem. We explored several prompt design alternatives to generate ESM simulation programs, evaluated the output code in terms of semantics and syntax, and interviewed ESM practitioners. We found that engineering LLM-enabled ESM simulations have the potential to facilitate data generation, but they perpetuate trust and reliability challenges.  © 2024 Owner/Author.",2024,,Proc.

MindfulDiary: Harnessing Large Language Model to Support Psychiatric Patients' Journaling,"Kim, T.; Bae, S.; Kim, H.A.; Lee, S.-W.; Hong, H.; Yang, C.; Kim, Y.-H.","Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising opportunities in mental health domains, although their inherent complexity and low controllability elicit concern regarding their applicability in clinical settings. We present MindfulDiary, an LLM-driven journaling app that helps psychiatric patients document daily experiences through conversation. Designed in collaboration with mental health professionals, MindfulDiary takes a state-based approach to safely comply with the experts' guidelines while carrying on free-form conversations. Through a four-week field study involving 28 patients with major depressive disorder and five psychiatrists, we examined how MindfulDiary facilitates patients' journaling practice and clinical care. The study revealed that MindfulDiary supported patients in consistently enriching their daily records and helped clinicians better empathize with their patients through an understanding of their thoughts and daily contexts. Drawing on these findings, we discuss the implications of leveraging LLMs in the mental health domain, bridging the technical feasibility and their integration into clinical settings. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)",2024,,Conf Hum Fact Comput Syst Proc,,,,,10.1145/3613904.3642937,,#9268,Kim 2024,"",""
A psychological evaluation method incorporating noisy label correction mechanism,"Jin, Z.; Su, R.; Liu, Y.; Duan, C.","Using machine learning and deep learning methods to analyze text data from social media can effectively explore hidden emotional tendencies and evaluate the psychological state of social media account owners. However, the label noise caused by mislabeling may significantly influence the training and prediction results of traditional supervised models. To resolve this problem, this paper proposes a psychological evaluation method that incorporates a noisy label correction mechanism and designs an evaluation framework that consists of a primary classification model and a noisy label correction mechanism. Firstly, the social media text data are transformed into heterogeneous text graphs, and a classification model combining a pre-trained model with a graph neural network is constructed to extract semantic features and structural features, respectively. After that, the Gaussian mixture model is used to select the samples that are likely to be mislabeled. Then, soft labels are generated for them to enable noisy label correction without prior knowledge of the noise distribution information. Finally, the corrected and clean samples are composed into a new data set and re-input into the primary model for mental state classification. Results of experiments on three real data sets indicate that the proposed method outperforms current advanced models in classification accuracy and noise robustness under different noise ratio settings, and can efficiently explore the potential sentiment tendencies and users’ psychological states in social media text data. © The Author(s) 2024.",2024,,Soft Comput.,28,11-12,7395-7407,,10.1007/s00500-023-09479-w,,#9276,Jin 2024,"",""
A hybrid depression detection model and correlation analysis for social media based on attention mechanism,"Liu, J.; Chen, W.; Wang, L.; Ding, F.","As a serious mental illness, depression can be extremely harmful to the physical and mental health of individuals. However, detecting depression can be challenging due to the reluctance of the depressed to actively express themselves. Fortunately, in modern society, online social platforms provide an opportunity for genuine self-expression in our daily lives. Leveraging the power of social data, we can identify potentially depressed users efficiently and accurately. This lays a strong foundation for subsequent interventions. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model that comprehensively considers the features and post texts of users by utilizing a simplified multi-head attention mechanism for detecting user depression. Compared to traditional models, such as Decision Tree and Random Forest, the simplified multi-head attention mechanism achieves higher classification accuracy while offering enhanced interpretability at the individual level. To verify the validity of our model, we apply it to the Weibo User Depression Detection Dataset (WU3D) containing approximately 1,150,000 posts from around 21,000 users. The dataset has been classified by human experts as either depressed or not. The results show that our model both explains the association of each feature of a single user well and achieves better performance than traditional methods. Notably, the final F1-score of our new model on the test set is 0.9473. Furthermore, by visualizing attention scores, we conduct a correlation analysis between different features and results for individual users, which can facilitate further analysis of the behavior and psychological characteristics of specific depressed users by professionals. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2023.",2024,,Intl.

Emotion detection using Word2Vec and convolution neural networks,"Jadon, A.K.; Kumar, S.","Emotion detection from text plays a very critical role in different domains, including customer service, social media analysis, healthcare, financial services, education, human-to-computer interaction, psychology, and many more.

Exploring ChatGPT for Toxicity Detection in GitHub,"Mishra, S.; Chatterjee, P.","Fostering a collaborative and inclusive environment is crucial for the sustained progress of open source development. However, the prevalence of negative discourse, often manifested as toxic comments, poses significant challenges to developer well-being and productivity. To identify such negativity in project communications, especially within large projects, automated toxicity detection models are necessary. To train these models effectively, we need large software engineering-specific toxicity datasets. However, such datasets are limited in availability and often exhibit imbalance (e.g., only 6 in 1000 GitHub issues are toxic) [1], posing challenges for training effective toxicity detection models. To address this problem, we explore a zero-shot LLM (ChatGPT) that is pre-trained on massive datasets but without being fine-tuned specifically for the task of detecting toxicity in software-related text. Our preliminary evaluation indicates that ChatGPT shows promise in detecting toxicity in GitHub, and warrants further investigation.

Determining PolyCystic Ovarian Syndrome Severity from Reddit Posts using Topic Modelling and Association Rule Mining,"Selvaraj, S.; Sundaradhas, S.N.","Nowadays social media plays a vital role in various real-time applications, especially in healthcare applications. PolyCystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is a condition that affects females between the ages of 15 and 35 who are of reproductive potential. The symptoms of PCOS are hormonal issues, irregular periods, weight gain, follicles, infertility, excessive hair growth in the skin, hair loss, acne, pimples, dark scars, and depression. Most of the earlier researchers analyzed the PCOS based on clinical text and health records using a machine learning approach. The main motivation of this proposed work is to predict the upcoming PCOS symptoms based on current symptoms and find the severity of the PCOS from Reddit users. This is done by collecting head symptoms from Gynecologists, gathering present symptoms from Reddit users, collecting unstructured data is pre-processed and PCOS sub symptoms are extracted using Bag of Words. The sub symptoms are mapped into head symptoms using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for dimension reduction. The major issue in that approach is a single user has experienced the same type of symptom multiple times. This issue is solved by implementing a novel method called Symptom Segmentation and grouping Labeled Latent Dirichlet Allocation (SSG_LLDA) is designed to reduce the dimensionality and map the social media users sub symptoms into head symptoms. Association Rule Mining (ARM) with Apriori is employed to produce the frequent symptoms, and effective rule sets, and form the distinctive symptom patterns. Among several mini-mum support and confidence metrics, 0.02 and 0.1 delivers the best rule sets and symptom patterns. Based on rulesets of symptom patterns and combinations, the severity of PCOS is determined for Reddit users. The novelty of this work is the construction of PCOS symptom patterns from topic modelling results instead of original data so the dimensionality of the features is reduced and more scalable. © 2024, Zarka Private University.

Multi Level Learning based Hierarchical Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory Model for Depression Intensity Prediction,"Velu, S.; Muthuswamy, P.","Predicting the intensity of a user’s depression accurately is crucial for early intervention and preventing mental and physical health issues. Social media platforms are valuable sources of data for understanding and addressing mental health concerns. From this viewpoint, a Multi-Feature Long Short-Term Memory (MF-LSTM) network was developed to estimate depression levels in social media users based on various features: user-specific, community-specific, emotional, and structural features. However, the fixed values of hyperparameters used in MF-LSTM lead to overfitting issues and degrade accuracy. To address this, the MF-BERT-Optimized LSTM (MF-BERT-OLSTM) model is proposed in this article. This model uses an Improved Osprey Optimization Algorithm (IO2A) to optimize the LSTM network hyperparameters. The IO2A mimics the hunting behavior of ospreys for fish from the sea, focusing on balancing exploration and exploitation search processes. The analogy of osprey’s hunting behavior is used to find hyperparameters of LSTM in this paper. This IO2A adopts the Circle chaotic mapping in population initialization to improve diversity among individuals and quality of initial solutions. It also uses a dynamically modifiable elite leadership strategy for location updating, balancing global search capabilities and convergence speed. Additionally, a dynamic chaotic weight factor is employed to improve local search capabilities. Thus, the LSTM network parameters are optimized for training and predicting users’ depression levels. Additionally, this model uses BERT to better encode the complete semantic information of the given tweet sequences. The experimental results show that the MF-BERT-OLSTM model outperforms the MF-LSTM, Mood2Content, Ensemble, and MentalBERT models on the COVID-19 Twitter Dataset and Post-Traumatic Twitter Dataset.

Convolution Neural Network Having Multiple Channels with Own Attention Layer for Depression Detection from Social Data,"Dalal, S.; Jain, S.; Dave, M.","People share textual posts about their interests, routines, and moods on social platforms, which can be targeted to evaluate their mental state using diverse techniques such as lexical approaches, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL). Bigger grams (bi, tri, or quad) carry more contextual information than unigrams. However, most of the models used in the classification of depression include only unigrams. Moreover, the well-known depression classifiers, the recurrent neural networks (RNN), retain only the sequential information of the text and ignores the local features of postings. We suggest using a convolutional neural network of multiple channels (MCNN) to capture local features and larger context from user posts. Also, each channel has a dedicated dot-product attention layer to capture global features from local features of various context levels. The proposed model is tested on a depression dataset CLEF-eRisk 2018 with 214 depressed and 1493 non-depressed users’ posts. Experimental results show that our model achieved competitive accuracy, recall, and f-score of 91.00%, 76.50%, and 70.51%, respectively. Accuracy is up to 5.00% higher and recall is approximately 24% higher than multi-channel CNN without an attention layer. Significant grams highlighted by the attention mechanism can be employed to provide a user-level explanation for the depression classification results.

Multi-channel CNN to classify Nepali COVID-19 related tweets using hybrid features,"Sitaula, C.; Shahi, T.B.","Because of the current COVID-19 pandemic’s increasing fears among people, it has triggered several health complications such as depression and anxiety. Such complications have not only affected developed countries but also developing countries such as Nepal. These complications can be understood from peoples’ tweets and comments posted online after their felicitous analysis and sentiment classification. Nevertheless, owing to the limited number of tokens and words in each tweet, it is crucial to capture multiple pieces of information associated with them for better understanding. In this study, we, first, represent each tweet by combining both syntactic and semantic information, called hybrid features. The syntactic information is generated from the bag-of-words method, whereas the semantic information is generated from the combination of the fastText-based (ft) and domain-specific (ds) methods. Second, we design a novel multi-channel CNN (MCNN) model, which ensembles the multiple CNNs, to capture multi-scale information for better classification. Last, we evaluate the efficacy of both the proposed feature extraction method and the MCNN model classifying tweets into three sentiment classes (positive, neutral, and negative) on the NepCOV19Tweets dataset, which is the only public COVID-19 tweets dataset in the Nepali language.

Detection and Sentiment Analysis Based on Mental Disorders Aspects Using Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit and Semantic Similarity,"Sutranggono, A.N.; Sarno, R.","Mental disorders significantly impact daily life and are among the leading causes of suicide. Despite numerous studies on detecting mental disorders on social media, the focus has primarily been on identifying the presence or absence of indications in posts, with most studies concentrating solely on one specific mental disorder, particularly depression. There is a lack of comprehensive analysis of the detection results. Therefore, this study analyzes mental disorders in more detail by applying detection and sentiment analysis based on five aspects, namely ADHD (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder), anxiety, bipolar, depression, and PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder). The detection process utilizes bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) embedding and the bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU) model. Subsequently, aspect categorization employs semantic similarity, which assesses the resemblance between terms generated from hidden topic extraction via non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and keywords linked to the five mental disorder aspects, extracted using a combination of term extraction methods. Additionally, sentiment classification leverages BERT embedding and the BiGRU model. The proposed method successfully identifies mental disorders, categorizes aspects, and classifies sentiment accurately. Optimal performance is achieved in mental disorders detection (0.9009) using BERT embedding + BiGRU, aspect categorization (0.8507) employing semantic similarity + BiGRU, and sentiment classification (0.8717) through BERT embedding + BiGRU. The analysis results unveil that texts related to mental disorders often convey negative sentiments, with the depression aspect exhibiting higher percentages of negative sentiment compared to other mental disorder aspects. © (2024), (Intelligent Network and Systems Society).

MentalQA: An Annotated Arabic Corpus for Questions and Answers of Mental Healthcare,"Alhuzali, H.; Alasmari, A.; Alsaleh, H.","Mental health disorders significantly impact people globally, regardless of background, education, or socioeconomic status. However, access to adequate care remains a challenge, particularly for underserved communities with limited resources. Text mining tools offer immense potential to support mental healthcare by assisting professionals in diagnosing and treating patients. This study addresses the scarcity of Arabic mental health resources for developing such tools. We introduce MentalQA, a novel Arabic dataset featuring questioning-answering (QA) style, including a total of 1000 annotations. To ensure data quality, we conducted a rigorous annotation process using a well-defined schema with quality control measures. Data was collected from a question-answering medical platform. The annotation schema for mental health questions and corresponding answers draws upon existing classification schemes with some modifications. Question types encompass six distinct categories: diagnosis, treatment, anatomy & physiology, epidemiology, healthy lifestyle, and provider choice. Answer strategies include information provision, direct guidance, and emotional support. Three experienced annotators collaboratively annotated the data to ensure consistency. Our findings demonstrate high inter-annotator agreement, with Fleiss' Kappa of 0.61 for question types and 0.98 for answer strategies. Our in-depth analysis uncovered insightful patterns in patients behavior and doctor responses. We found a link between the types of questions asked and the strategies doctors use in their answers. Both genders focused on treatment-related questions, though with some variation in emphasis. Interestingly, the types of questions asked also differed by age group. Patients tended to express negative emotions in their questions, while doctors maintained a neutral tone in their responses. Finally, we observed differences in how long it took doctors to answer and the number of words they used depending on the type of question.

Patients with SMI who are prescribed Flexible Assertive Community Treatment (FACT) create a treatment plan together with their case manager, which serves as the leading document describing the goals that will be worked on during treatment. In order to incorporate the treatment plan goals of a patient in an mHealth application, the treatment plan goals need to be measurable. However, in previous work, we discovered that on average, only 25% of the available treatment plans include measurable goals. We have developed a protocol for making measurable goals with patients with SMI to address this issue. However, we anticipate low adoption of the protocol due to the potentially time-consuming nature of the steps involved. To mitigate this, we are exploring the use of AI to generate measurable treatment plan goals for patients with SMI and introduce a new workflow.

Nevertheless, there are still many domains that require further evaluation, especially those related to sensitive data and users, such as mental health. In this article, we evaluate several ensemble approaches to combine the Zero-Shot predictions of several families of open-source Language Models, specifically, RoBERTa and LLama-2, in the task of mental-health topics classification under limited data and computational resource conditions. With this purpose, we employed two datasets containing realistic questions and answers, Counsel-Chat and 7Cups datasets labeled in 28 and 39 fine-grain unbalanced mental-health topics. The best ensembles of non-fine-tuned models with Zero-Shot approaches achieved an accuracy (ACC) of 43.29%, weighted-F1 (W-F1) of 41.32% and Macro-F1 (M-F1) of 31.79% in the 28 topics of Counsel-Chat; and 35.57% of ACC, 39.66% W-F1 and 28.12% of M-F1 in the 39 topics of 7Cups dataset. The error analysis reveals that models have difficulties in detecting less concrete topics (e.g. ‘Social’), which suggests future lines to re-organize classes in topics and sub-topics, or the incorporation into the ensemble of models adapted to these domains to compensate for these errors. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",2024,,Lect.

LLMental: Classification of Mental Disorders with Large Language Models,"Nowacki, A.; Sitek, W.; Rybiński, H.","The increasing number of mental disorders is a severe problem in the modern world and can even lead to suicide if left untreated. In the age of digitalization, we move part of our lives to social media, where we share both the good and the bad moments. This allows for the early detection of mental disorders (such as depression, excessive stress, or social phobia) of which the user may even be unaware. We propose to modify large language models, such as PHI-2, Mistral, Flan-T5, or LLaMA 2, to classify mental disorders and to add appropriate layers. This gives a better prediction performance than zero-shot/few-shot for LLMs and classification by BERT-based models. Using such an architecture makes it possible to return a label rather than text, thus allowing the output of the LLM model to be freely modified. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",2024,,Lect.

Intent aware data augmentation by leveraging generative AI for stress detection in social media texts,"Saleem, M.; Kim, J.","Stress is a major issue in modern society. Researchers focus on identifying stress in individuals, linking language with mental health, and often utilizing social media posts. However, stress classification systems encounter data scarcity issues, necessitating data augmentation. Approaches like Back-Translation (BT), Easy Data Augmentation (EDA), and An Easier Data Augmentation (AEDA) are common. But, recent studies show the potential of generative AI, notably ChatGPT. This article centers on stress identification using the DREADDIT dataset and A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa) transformer, emphasizing the use of generative AI for augmentation. We propose two ChatGPT prompting techniques: same-intent and opposite-intent 1-shot intent-aware data augmentation. Same-intent prompts yield posts with similar topics and sentiments, while opposite-intent prompts produce posts with contrasting sentiments. Results show a 2% and 3% performance increase for opposing and same sentiments, respectively. This study pioneers intent-based data augmentation for stress detection and explores advanced mental health text classification methods with generative AI. It concludes that data augmentation has limited benefits and highlights the importance of diverse Reddit data and further research in this field. © (2024) Saleem and Kim.",2024,,PeerJ Comput.

A Hybrid Learning-Architecture for Mental Disorder Detection Using Emotion Recognition,"Aina, J.; Akinniyi, O.; Rahman, M.M.; Odero-Marah, V.; Khalifa, F.","Mental illness has grown to become a prevalent and global health concern that affects individuals across various demographics. Timely detection and accurate diagnosis of mental disorders are crucial for effective treatment and support as late diagnosis could result in suicidal, harmful behaviors and ultimately death. To this end, the present study introduces a novel pipeline for the analysis of facial expressions, leveraging both the AffectNet and 2013 Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) datasets. Consequently, this research goes beyond traditional diagnostic methods by contributing a system capable of generating a comprehensive mental disorder dataset and concurrently predicting mental disorders based on facial emotional cues. Particularly, we introduce a hybrid architecture for mental disorder detection leveraging the state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, YOLOv8 to detect and classify visual cues associated with specific mental disorders. To achieve accurate predictions, an integrated learning architecture based on the fusion of Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) and Visual Transformer (ViT) models is developed to form an ensemble classifier that predicts the presence of mental illness (e.g., depression, anxiety, and other mental disorder). The overall accuracy is improved to about 81% using the proposed ensemble technique. To ensure transparency and interpretability, we integrate techniques such as Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and saliency maps to highlight the regions in the input image that significantly contribute to the model's predictions thus providing healthcare professionals with a clear understanding of the features influencing the system's decisions thereby enhancing trust and more informed diagnostic process. © 2013 IEEE.",2024,,IEEE Access,12,,91410-91425,,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3421376,,#9519,Aina 2024,"",""

Toward Early Detection of Depression: Detecting Depression Symptoms in Arabic Tweets Using Pretrained Transformers,"Elmajali, S.; Ahmad, I.","The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated setbacks have significantly impacted human mental health. Depression of various intensities has resulted due to a wide variety of losses that people have experienced. However, unlike physical illness, mental illness is still underestimated by patients themselves and by society due to various factors, such as the societal stigma of visiting a psychotherapist and being diagnosed with a mental health disorder. On the other hand, general practitioners can recognize signs of depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), which is used as a screening test for depression. The PHQ-9 questionnaire comprises nine questions that correspond to the nine symptoms of depression outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). In this paper, we aim to detect the nine depression symptoms stated by DSM-5 from Arabic tweets, as recognizing the type of depression symptom is crucial in diagnosing depression. We used AraBERT and MARBERT pretrained transformers to classify tweets with depression symptoms. We also performed data augmentation using ChatGPT to balance the training set. The model was applied to a dataset consisting of 1,290 samples labeled with nine different symptoms, in addition to a 'normal' class which was also generated using ChatGPT. This work used four performance metrics to evaluate the models' performance, which are accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores. The AraBERT and MARBERT transformers have yielded promising results, achieving accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores of 99.3%, 99.1%, 98.8%, and 98.9%, respectively, using the AraBERT transformer.

Personality Traits Assessment: A Case of Study Using Text Mining Techniques,"Sapino, M.; Cagnina, L.; Montenegro, L.; Ferretti, E.","This paper presents a complete experience to solving a personality trait assessment problem using Text Mining techniques within the framework of Knowledge Discovery in Databases. The study involves collaboration between researchers from the fields of Computer Science and Psychology, highlighting the interdisciplinary nature of the work. In this study, four basic predictive algorithms were evaluated: Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Decision Trees. These algorithms were applied to address the classification problem posed by personality trait assessment. Given the nature of the problem, where individuals may possess multiple personality traits to varying degrees, the classification task was modeled in three different ways: binary, multiclass, and multilabel. To enhance the performance of the classification approaches, a data augmentation technique was employed. The results indicate that data augmentation improves the performance of all classification approaches, with binary classification benefiting the most. Moreover, for three out of the five personality traits studied, the weighted-F1 scores exceed 0.75, indicating strong predictive accuracy. Notably, the Responsibility trait achieves the highest score of 0.88, demonstrating the effectiveness of the classification approach for this particular trait. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",2024,,Commun.

Arabic cyberbullying detection system using convolutional neural network and multi-head attention,"Azzeh, M.; Alhijawi, B.; Tabbaza, A.; Alabboshi, O.; Hamdan, N.; Jaser, D.","In the digital era, cyberbullying is a growing concern that impacts the well-being of its victims. The rise of cyberbullying among social media users necessitates robust detection solutions. One of these solutions is to build a classification model to identify the true cyberbullying messages. Most of these models have been designated for English and other Western languages. The Arabic language is still under-resourced and lacks research in the field, even though it is deemed one of the most widely spoken languages in the world. This study introduces a new Arabic cyberbullying detection method, namely AraCB. AraCB is a deep learning-based method that adopts convolutional neural networks, attention, and ResNet to detect cyberbullying text. The proposed method uses word2vec, the attention mechanism, and positional encoding to represent the semantic meaning, sequential nature of language, and cyberbullying contexts. Also, the local patterns in the word embeddings are captured using a convolutional layer. to accomplish that, we used one of the popular Arabic tweet dataset called ArCybC. Numerous experiments were conducted to evaluate and compare AraCB to popular classification models, employing different vector sizes, embedding methods, and aggregation techniques. On average, AraCB enhances accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, and AUC by 16.5%, 29.89%, 18.4%, 26.93%, and 16.66%, respectively. In addition, ArCybC performance aligns closely with that of alternative methods employing transformer-based text representation approaches, all while avoiding the computational complexities often associated with such techniques.

Mental disorder and suicidal ideation detection from social media using deep neural networks,"Ezerceli, Ö.; Dehkharghani, R.","Depression and suicidal ideation are global reasons for life-threatening injury and death. Mental disorders have increased especially among young people in recent years, and early detection of those cases can prevent suicide attempts. Social media platforms provide users with an anonymous space to interact with others, making them a secure environment to discuss their mental disorders. This paper proposes a solution to detect depression/suicidal ideation using natural language processing and deep learning techniques. We used Transformers and a unique model to train the proposed model and applied it to three different datasets: SuicideDetection, CEASEv2.0, and SWMH. The proposed model is evaluated using the accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curve. The proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art in the SuicideDetection and CEASEv2.0 datasets, achieving F1 scores of 0.97 and 0.75, respectively. However, in the SWMH data set, the proposed model is 4% points behind the state-of-the-art precision providing the F1 score of 0.68. In the real world, this project could help psychologists in the early detection of depression and suicidal ideation for a more efficient treatment. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in two of the three datasets, so they could be used to develop a screening tool that could be used by mental health professionals or individuals to assess their own risk of suicide.

Children's Sentiment Analysis from Texts by Using Weight Updated Tuned with Random Forest Classification,"Ahmed Bilal, A.; Ayhan Erdem, O.; Toklu, S.","Sentimental Analysis is considered a computational strategy that helps in identifying and assessing the emotions of people via text documents. Tools and different methods have been adopted for determining both positive and negative emotions in the form of text data analytics by using Machine and Deep Learning techniques. Experimentally, it has been shown that the accuracy of existing text classification models such as Bi-LSTM, Decision Tree, and Ensemble Classifiers is limited by poor quality data, inappropriate hyperparameter tuning, and model-specific bias levels. Additionally, these models are prone to overfitting, high computational overhead, and longer training time. To overcome these limitations, we proposed a hybrid binary classification framework by combining Deep sequential features with the Random Forest (RF) technique. The approach is implemented in four phases: Initially, data preprocessing is performed by employing a Vader sentiment package. In the second step, the deep Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model was employed to extract deep sequential features corresponding to sad and happy emotions. In the third phase, a bi-orthogonalization algorithm with principal component Analysis (PCA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) was employed to minimize the redundancy and maximize the relevance of extracted features. Finally, a five-fold cross-validation technique was implemented to discriminate sad and happy emotions using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. Eventually, a grid search approach was implemented for hyperparameter tuning and results were compared with five baseline algorithms (Vanilla LSTM (VLSTM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Naïve Bayes (NB), Ada Boost Algorithm (ABA).

Attach-SwiNet: Multimodal Attachment Style Classification Model Based on Non-Verbal Signals,"Maghfira, T.N.; Basaruddin, T.; Alfa Krisnadhi, A.; Redatin Retno Pudjiati, S.","Attachment systems, which signify emotional bonds with significant others, play a crucial role in influencing self-development and social interactions. Research on adult attachment in psychology has predominantly utilized questionnaires and interviews, focusing mainly on romantic relationships and parent-child interactions during childhood. Although machine learning approaches in adult attachment research have begun to assess non-verbal behaviors objectively, the connection between these behaviors and attachment styles has not yet been fully explored. This paper presents Attach-SwiNet, a new multimodal model for classifying attachment styles in close relationships among young adults. Our model combines representations of emotions from non-verbal behaviors with subjective responses to categorize attachment styles. It utilizes pre-trained Swin Transformers to analyze emotional cues in facial expression videos and pre-trained ResNet50 to examine speech responses. By integrating the most effective emotion representations from both datasets with rating data from the Experiences in Close Relationships - Relationship Structures (ECR-RS), our model significantly enhances the accuracy of classifying attachment styles. Experimental results show that our approach improves performance over traditional unimodal behavioral data and subjective questionnaire responses by 1.13%.  © 2013 IEEE.",2024,,IEEE Access,12,,79151-79165,,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3397608,,#9660,Maghfira 2024,"",""
Exploring the Effectiveness of Different Embedding Methods for Toxicity Classification,"Al-Daoud, E.; Samara, G.; Sara, M.R.A.; Taqatqa, S.; Kanan, M.","Toxic comments have the potential to negatively impact individuals’ mental health, self-esteem, and overall well-being. Online bullying, hate speech, and harassment often result in emotional distress, anxiety, and even depression among targeted individuals. Furthermore, toxic comments can foster an atmosphere of hostility, division, and polarization within communities, contributing to the erosion of civil discourse and the spread of misinformation. Toxicity classification is an important task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves determining the level of toxicity or offensiveness in a given text. Embedding methods play a crucial role in toxicity classification by transforming textual data into numerical representations that capture semantic and contextual information. This paper explores the efficiency of different embedding approaches for toxicity classification in text, posts or reviews. Particularly, the study compares efficiency of conventional approaches such as CountVectorizer as well as TF-IDF with state-of-the-art approaches including Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT and also GPT3. A large dataset of toxic comments, reviews, or posts is used to evaluate the efficiency of these approaches, employing common metrics like F1-score. The outcomes suggest that GPT3 embedding surpasses all various other approaches accomplishing the greatest F1-score 98.9, followed by Bert and Word2Vec. These results recommend that utilizing pre-trained contextualized embedding can considerably enhance the precision of toxicity classification models. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",2024,,Stud.

"A Multimodal Approach for Detection and Assessment of Depression Using Text, Audio and Video","Zhang, W.; Mao, K.; Chen, J.","Depression is one of the most common mental disorders, and rates of depression in individuals increase each year. Traditional diagnostic methods are primarily based on professional judgment, which is prone to individual bias. Therefore, it is crucial to design an effective and robust diagnostic method for automated depression detection. Current artificial intelligence approaches are limited in their abilities to extract features from long sentences. In addition, current models are not as robust with large input dimensions. To solve these concerns, a multimodal fusion model comprised of text, audio, and video for both depression detection and assessment tasks was developed. In the text modality, pre-trained sentence embedding was utilized to extract semantic representation along with Bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) to predict depression. This study also used Principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the input feature space and Support vector machine (SVM) to predict depression based on audio modality. In the video modality, Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) was employed to conduct both feature selection and depression detection. The final predictions were given by outputs of the different modalities with an ensemble voting algorithm. Experiments on the Distress analysis interview corpus wizard-of-Oz (DAIC-WOZ) dataset showed a great improvement of performance, with a weighted F1 score of 0.85, a Root mean square error (RMSE) of 5.57, and a Mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.48. Our proposed model outperforms the baseline in both depression detection and assessment tasks, and was shown to perform better than other existing state-of-the-art depression detection methods. © International Human Phenome Institutes (Shanghai) 2024.",2024,,Phenomics,,,,,10.1007/s43657-023-00152-8,,#9663,Zhang 2024,"",""

"Detection and prediction of Future Mental disorder from Social Media Data using Machine Learning, Ensemble Learning, and Large Language Models.","Abdullah, M.; Negied, N.","Social media platforms are used widely by all people to express their feelings, opinions, and emotional states. Billions of people worldwide use them daily to share what they think and feel in their posts. Amongst all social media available platforms, Facebook only contains around three billion personal accounts. In this work Reddit dataset is used to automatically detect mental illness from social media posts. This study is not only limited to early detection of already existing mental illness or disorder like depression and anxiety from social posts, but also and most importantly the study is extended to predict successfully potential mental illness that would happen in future. This study deploys Nineteen different models to study the capability of them in detecting and predicting mental disorders from social media posts. Some of the deployed models are classical machine learning classifiers, some are ensemble learning models, and the rest are large language models (LLMs). Six machine learning classifiers were used in this work for the automatic detection and prediction of mental illness and logistic regression proved to be the best amongst other classifiers in this task. Nine Ensemble methods were also used and examined. Amongst the Nine ensemble learning models VC2, Light GBM, Bagging estimator, and XGBoost proved to be superior in this task. Four large language models were also used and examined for the same task. RoBERTa and OpenAI GPT proved to outperform the rest of models in this task. All those models were built, trained, tested, and compared with previous work in literature to get the best possible results. The study covers the main four mental disorders which are ADHD, Anxiety, Bipolar, and Depression. The work proposed in this paper succeeded in outperforming the results in literature in terms of number of addressed mental disorders, number of models used and tested, and dataset size used to validate results. The proposed work also outperformed the only attempt in literature that addressed all mental disorders in results of detection and prediction noticeably. This work achieved the detection of already existing mental disorders F1-score of 0.80 from clinical data and of 0.52 from non-clinical data, and it achieved a prediction of future mental disorder F1-score of 0.43 from non-clinical data.

Depression Intensity Classification from Tweets Using FastText Based Weighted Soft Voting Ensemble,"Rizwan, M.; Mushtaq, M.F.; Rafiq, M.; Mehmood, A.; Diez, I.D.L.T.; Villar, M.G.; Garay, H.; Ashraf, I.","Predicting depression intensity from microblogs and social media posts has numerous benefits and applications, including predicting early psychological disorders and stress in individuals or the general public. A major challenge in predicting depression using social media posts is that the existing studies do not focus on predicting the intensity of depression in social media texts but rather only perform the binary classification of depression and moreover noisy data makes it difficult to predict the true depression in the social media text. This study intends to begin by collecting relevant Tweets and generating a corpus of 210000 public tweets using Twitter public application programming interfaces (APIs). A strategy is devised to filter out only depression-related tweets by creating a list of relevant hashtags to reduce noise in the corpus. Furthermore, an algorithm is developed to annotate the data into three depression classes: ‘Mild,’ ‘Moderate,’ and ‘Severe,’ based on International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) depression diagnostic criteria. Different baseline classifiers are applied to the annotated dataset to get a preliminary idea of classification performance on the corpus. Further FastText-based model is applied and fine-tuned with different preprocessing techniques and hyperparameter tuning to produce the tuned model, which significantly increases the depression classification performance to an 84% F1 score and 90% accuracy compared to baselines. Finally, a FastText-based weighted soft voting ensemble (WSVE) is proposed to boost the model’s performance by combining several other classifiers and assigning weights to individual models according to their individual performances. The proposed WSVE outperformed all baselines as well as FastText alone, with an F1 of 89%, 5% higher than FastText alone, and an accuracy of 93%, 3% higher than FastText alone. The proposed model better captures the contextual features of the relatively small sample class and aids in the detection of early depression intensity prediction from tweets with impactful performances. © 2024 Tech Science Press.

A Deep Learning-Based Sentiment Classification Approach for Detecting Suicidal Ideation on Social Media Posts,"Kumar, P.S.V.T.; Sisodia, D.S.; Shrivastava, R.","The identification of suicidal ideation in a person is known as Suicide Ideation Detection (SID). Nowadays, people share their thoughts and sentiments through social platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit rather than face-to-face. Recently various machine learning and deep learning models have been applied to the SID task. However, these methods lack in learning the user’s intent through social media text by analyzing the semantic meaning and context of the textual post. Additionally, recent methods have employed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based deep learning models for learning users’ suicidal intent. But these methods still lack in investigating the user’s social media interaction. Hence this work first analyzes the semantics and context of the text and obtains the polarity score of the user’s social media posts. Next, this study analyzes the social media interaction between users by incorporating the attention mechanism. We apply Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and LSTM with an attention mechanism to classify the suicidal and non-suicidal intent of the users. We used the dataset from Kaggle, the Suicide and Depression Detection dataset that contains the posts from Reddit (a social media platform). The necessary textual data preprocessing steps, such as removing accent characters, and emojis, fixing the word length, spelling corrections, and lemmatization, are applied. The CNN, LSTM, and LSTM with an Attention mechanism are applied with the Sigmoid function as the activation function and binary cross entropy (BCE) as the loss function. We implemented four convolution layers with different filter sizes in CNN Model, two hidden layers in LSTM Model, and one hidden layer in LSTM along with an attention layer. Precision, accuracy, f1-score, and recall are used as evaluation measures in order to assess the suggested model's competence. The proposed model is compared with the baseline models of other authors.

Multimodal mental state analysis,"Rai, B.K.; Jain, I.; Tiwari, B.; Saxena, A.","Self-reports or professional interviews have typically been used to diagnose depression, although these methods often miss significant behavioral signals. Sometimes, people with depression may not express their feelings accurately, which can make it hard for psychologists to diagnose them correctly. We believe that paying attention to how people speak and behave can help us better identify depression. In real-life situations, psychologists can use different methods, like listening to how someone talks, their body language and change in their emotions while talking. To detect signs of depression more accurately authors presents MANOBAL, a system that analyzes voice, text, and facial expressions to detect depression. We use the DAIC-WoZ dataset, which was requested from the University of Southern California (UoS). We used this dataset for the multimodal depression detection model. Deep learning is challenged with such complicated data, therefore MANOBAL used a multimodal method. It uses elements from audio recordings, text, and facial expressions to predict both depression and its severity. This fusion has two advantages: first, it can substitute for uncertain data in one modality (such as voice) by using input from another (text, facial expressions). Second, it can give more weight to more dependable data sources, which improves accuracy. Small datasets are not very helpful when testing accuracy in fusion models, but MANOBAL overcomes this by exploiting DAIC-Woz dataset's transfer characteristics and increasing training labels. The initial results are encouraging, with a root mean square error of 0.168 for predicting depression severity. Experiments show the effectiveness of combining modalities. High-level features based on Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) give useful information on depression, but adding additional audio characteristics and facial action unit increases accuracy by 10% and 20%, respectively. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",2024,,Health Serv.

Abusive Language Detection in Urdu Text: Leveraging Deep Learning and Attention Mechanism,"Khan, A.; Ahmed, A.; Jan, S.; Bilal, M.; Zuhairi, M.F.","The widespread use of the Internet and the tremendous growth of social media have enabled people to connect with each other worldwide. Individuals are free to express themselves online, sharing their photos, videos, and text messages globally. However, such freedom sometimes leads to misuse, as some individuals exploit this platform by posting hateful and abusive comments on forums. The proliferation of abusive language on social media negatively impacts individuals and groups, leading to emotional distress and affecting mental health. It is crucial to automatically detect and filter such abusive content in order to effectively tackle this challenging issue. Detecting abusive language in text messages is challenging due to intentional word concealment and contextual complexity. To counter abusive speech on social media, we need to explore the potential of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models, particularly those equipped with attention mechanisms. In this study, we utilized popular ML and DL models integrated with attention mechanism to detect abusive language in Urdu text. Our methodology involved employing Count Vectorizer and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF/IDF) to extract n-grams at the word level: Unigrams (Uni), Bigrams (Bi), Trigrams (Tri), and their combination (Uni + Bi + Tri). Initially, we evaluated four traditional ML models - Logistic Regression (LR), Gaussian Naïve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) - on both proposed and established datasets. The results highlighted that RF model outperformed other conventional models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-measure on both datasets. In our implementation of deep learning models, we employed various models integrated with custom fastText and Word2Vec embeddings, each equipped with an attention layer, except for the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

Addressing this challenge, our study aims to discern telltale symptoms from statements made by the patient. We harness both audio and text data, proposing an Additive cross-modal attention network to learn and pick up the appropriate weights that best capture the cross-modal interactions and relationships between both features using BiLSTM as the backbone of both modalities.

A Test Dataset of Offensive Malay Language by a Cyberbullying Detection Model on Instagram Using Support Vector Machine,"Ismail, N.; Losada, D.E.; Ahmad, R.","Social media services have become a prevalent communication tool due to their capability to instantly share information with a large number of people for free. However, social media also facilitate cyberbullying, and studies have shown that cyberbullying on social media has a severe impact compared to other platforms. In some cases, cyberbullying provokes tragic problems, such as suicide. The information shared on social media services provides a massive amount of textual data, which can be used to explore patterns of human behaviors including cyberbullying. This paper aims to build a dataset of offensive language for research on cyberbullying in the Malay language through a series of baseline experiments by implementing SVM classifiers. These preliminary experiments helped to understand the performance of automatic tools that mine for abusive language within a corpus of Malay texts. To achieve the objectives, social media extraction methods and new crawling technologies oriented have been developed to monitor the Instagram accounts of popular Malaysian celebrities. The resulting collection contains 165,239 real-world comments associated with 27 Instagram public accounts. A sample of this corpus was manually labelled in terms of cyberbullying categories. After the dataset was cleaned, normalized, and vectorized, this led to a collection of 527 comments.

The negative text states the use of words indicating depression, which can be termed as one factor in deciding a patient's mental health. The model is built using libraries such as Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), and WordCloud. The second model predicts the presence of depression based on multiple health-related features such as the patient’s data related to various other disorders he/she is having, age, weight, BMI, blood-related features such as levels of calcium, CO2, phosphorus, iron, etc., and work-life related parameters.

Utilizing social media and machine learning for personality and emotion recognition using PERS,"Talaat, F.M.; El-Gendy, E.M.; Saafan, M.M.; Gamel, S.A.","Personality reflects how people can behave in different situations and affects their decisions. Analyzing personality is useful in many fields, for example in the prediction of performance in a job. Emotion recognition is another important research topic due to the wide spread of social media. People express their feeling in form of Facebook posts, tweeter real reactions, and shares. Understanding both personality and emotions from the written text is much easier when it comes to humans. However, this task is impossible with the huge amount of data spread all other social media. The use of machine learning algorithms for personality and emotion recognition from text data is a new research field. In this paper, we propose an enhanced recognition system for personality recognition and emotion recognition. The proposed enhanced recognition system is composed of four main modules, namely data acquisition module, data preprocessing module, personality recognition module, and emotion recognition module. Several machine learning algorithms are used for the multiclass classification process. Gray wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm is used for hyperparameter optimization, while group GWO (GGWO) algorithm is used for feature selection. The proposed model could achieve an accuracy of 99.99% using the random forest algorithm for personality detection and 88.06% using a decision tree for emotion recognition, which outperforms other state-of-the-art studies. We can profit from social media despite some of its drawbacks by understanding people's emotions through their tweets, posts, etc. For instance, before someone commits suicide, we can tell what their intentions are. Most suicide committers, according to recent studies, leave suicide notes on their social media accounts, and these letters need to be taken seriously. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",2023,,Neural Comput.

Cyberbullying Detection on Twitter Using Deep Learning-Based Attention Mechanisms and Continuous Bag of Words Feature Extraction,"Fati, S.M.; Muneer, A.; Alwadain, A.; Balogun, A.O.","Since social media platforms are widely used and popular, they have given us more opportunities than we can even imagine. Despite all of the known benefits, some users may abuse these opportunities to humiliate, insult, bully, and harass other people. This issue explains why there is a need to reduce such negative activities and create a safe cyberspace for innocent people by detecting cyberbullying activity. This study provides a comparative analysis of deep learning methods used to test and evaluate their effectiveness regarding a well-known global Twitter dataset. To recognize abusive tweets and overcome existing challenges, attention-based deep learning methods are introduced. The word2vec with CBOW concatenated formed the weights included in the embedding layer and was used to extract the features. The feature vector was input into a convolution and pooling mechanism, reducing the feature dimensionality while learning the position-invariant of the offensive words. A SoftMax function predicts feature classification. Using benchmark experimental datasets and well-known evaluation measures, the convolutional neural network model with attention-based long- and short-term memory was found to outperform other DL methods. The proposed cyberbullying detection methods were evaluated using benchmark experimental datasets and well-known evaluation measures. Finally, the results demonstrated the superiority of the attention-based 1D convolutional long short-term memory (Conv1DLSTM) classifier over the other implemented methods. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,,Mathematics,11,16,,,10.3390/math11163567,,#10136,Fati 2023,"",""
A Hybrid Deep Learning Approach Leveraging Word2Vec Feature Expansion for Cyberbullying Detection in Indonesian Twitter,"Asqolani, I.A.; Setiawan, E.B.","Twitter, a social media platform that enables users to generate, post, update, and peruse brief messages known as tweets, unfortunately, is frequently misused for circulating negative content encompassing cyberbullying. The detrimental effects of cyberbullying on the mental well-being of victims are profound, with extreme cases culminating in suicide due to severe stress. Consequently, preventive measures, inclusive of the development of a cyberbullying detection system for Twitter, are imperative. This study introduces a hybrid deep learning approach, incorporating feature expansion with Word2Vec and feature extraction with TF-IDF, for constructing a cyberbullying detection system tailored to the Indonesian language on Twitter. A sequence of test scenarios was executed on a system developed using a dataset of 29,085 Indonesian tweets. The outcomes of this study demonstrate that the highest accuracy was achieved by the CNN-LSTM hybrid model with an accuracy of 79.26%, and the LSTM-CNN hybrid model with an accuracy of 79.48%. These findings substantiate that the amalgamation of hybrid models, Word2Vec for feature augmentation, and TF-IDF for feature extraction, yields superior accuracy compared to other deep learning models. Consequently, this study has succeeded in identifying cyberbullying on Twitter, contributing to the development of a healthier social media environment for users. © 2023 International Information and Engineering Technology Association.

A comparative study on word embedding techniques for suicide prediction on COVID-19 tweets using deep learning models,"Kancharapu, R.; A Ayyagari, S.N.","COVID-19 caused a pathetic situation worldwide which led to public health crises, economic crises, employment losses, and mental anxiety. Social media websites are being inundated with reports on the virus, which has led to a variety of perspectives, thoughts, and emotions being expressed and experienced by social media sources. Taking advantage of the amount of information available, an analysis of sentiments user opinions expressed can be done on social networks. Sentiment Analysis is widely used in social media platforms for understanding the user’s expressions and sentiments. In this work, we extricate the information from Twitter utilizing search words, a python API called tweepy, pre-process it, and perform the word embedding process. The Word Embedding process is the replacement for the one-hot encoding technique, which converts the given into the form of vectors by tokenizing them as words and also spotting the relation among the words. Word Embedding Techniques such as Word2Vec, Glove, and FastText are used to convert the text into vectors which are then fed to the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Models for training. Valance Aware Dictionary and sentiment Reasoner (VADER) are used to detecting suicide propensity in tweets as positive, negative, and neutral after which the user can be notified and solutions are provided. As a result, we will be able to figure out the user’s suicidal feelings and emotions during the pandemic situation.

Prediction of Depression Severity Based on the Prosodic and Semantic Features With Bidirectional LSTM and Time Distributed CNN,"Mao, K.; Zhang, W.; Wang, D.B.; Li, A.; Jiao, R.; Zhu, Y.; Wu, B.; Zheng, T.; Qian, L.; Lyu, W.; Ye, M.; Chen, J.","Depression is increasingly impacting individuals both physically and psychologically worldwide. It has become a global major public health problem and attracts attention from various research fields. Traditionally, the diagnosis of depression is formulated through semi-structured interviews and supplementary questionnaires, which makes the diagnosis heavily relying on physicians' experience and is subject to bias. However, since the pathogenic mechanism of depression is still under investigation, it is difficult for physicians to diagnose and treat, especially in the early clinical stage. As smart devices and artificial intelligence advance rapidly, understanding how depression associates with daily behaviors can be beneficial for the early stage depression diagnosis, which reduces labor costs and the likelihood of clinical mistakes as well as physicians bias. Furthermore, mental health monitoring and cloud-based remote diagnosis can be implemented through an automated depression diagnosis system. In this article, we propose an attention-based multimodality speech and text representation for depression prediction. Our model is trained to estimate the depression severity of participants using the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus-Wizard of Oz (DAIC-WOZ) dataset. For the audio modality, we use the collaborative voice analysis repository (COVAREP) features provided by the dataset and employ a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Network (Bi-LSTM) followed by a Time-distributed Convolutional Neural Network (T-CNN). For the text modality, we use global vectors for word representation (GloVe) to perform word embeddings and the embeddings are fed into the Bi-LSTM network. Results show that both audio and text models perform well on the depression severity estimation task, with best sequence level F1F1 score of 0.9870 and patient-level F1F1 score of 0.9074 for the audio model over five classes (healthy, mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe), as well as sequence level F1F1 score of 0.9709 and patient-level F1F1 score of 0.9245 for the text model over five classes.

TSM-CV: Twitter Sentiment Analysis for COVID-19 Vaccines Using Deep Learning,"Albahli, S.; Nawaz, M.","The coronavirus epidemic has imposed a devastating impact on humans around the globe, causing profound anxiety, fear, and complex emotions and feelings. Vaccination against the new coronavirus has started, and people’s feelings are becoming more diverse and complicated. In the presented work, our goal is to use the deep learning (DL) technique to understand and elucidate their feelings. Due to the advancement of IT and internet facilities, people are socially connected to explain their emotions and sentiments. Among all social sites, Twitter is the most used platform among consumers and can assist scientists to comprehend people’s opinions related to anything. The major goal of this work is to understand the audience’s varying sentiments about the vaccination process by using data from Twitter. We have employed both the historic (All COVID-19 Vaccines Tweets Kaggle dataset) and real (tweets) data to analyze the people’s sentiments. Initially, a preprocessing step is applied to the input samples. Then, we use the FastText approach for computing semantically aware features. In the next step, we apply the Valence Aware Dictionary for sentiment Reasoner (VADER) method to assign the labels to the collected features as being positive, negative, or neutral. After this, a feature reduction step using the Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) approach is utilized to minimize the feature space. Finally, we have used the Random Multimodal Deep Learning (RMDL) classifier for sentiment prediction. We have confirmed through experimentation that our work is effective in examining the emotions of people toward the COVID-19 vaccines.

D-ResNet-PVKELM: deep neural network and paragraph vector based kernel extreme machine learning model for multimodal depression analysis,"Swasthika Jain, T.J.; Jacob, I.J.; Mandava, A.K.","Nowadays, depression heavily affects humans’ physical and mental health. Depression occurs due to changes in mood, loss of interest, and stress, which leads to self-harm events and suicide. Thus analyzing depression is very important to reduce suicidal acts. In recent years, automatic depression evaluation has been developed in computer vision technology. Several models were investigated for depression analysis, but they are limited only to video and audio data analysis. In this paper, hybrid Artificial Intelligence (AI) based Multi-modal depression analysis was proposed in which the severity of depression from multi-modal data such as video, audio and text descriptors are extracted. Initially, the proposed approach estimates the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) depression scale by a hybrid framework Residual Network based Deep Neural Network (D-ResNet), which computes the PHQ-8 score from video and audio features. Then, Paragraph Vector Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (PV-KELM) is developed to infer the mental and physical states of the individuals related to the psychoanalytic features of depression. It recognizes the absence (or) presence of the measured psychoanalytic symptoms. Finally, the estimated PHQ-8 score and psychoanalytic symptoms are extracted from the Residual Network based Deep Neural Network and the Paragraph Vector based Kernel Extreme Learning Machine, which is fed together into the ensemble classifier. In the ensemble classifier, three classifiers are used, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive-Bayes (NB), and Decision Tree (DT) classifier, to classify whether the individual is depressed or not. The proposed approach is implemented in PYTHON software, and the experiments will be carried out using the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus-Wizard of -OZ interview depression dataset. By using the proposed approach, the accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, RMSE, MAE, JSD and Contextual similarity obtained are 0.89, 0.86, 0.86 and 0.86, 0.373, 0.35, 0.355 and 0.689 respectively.

Characterizing the Differences in Descriptions of Violence on Reddit During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Li, L.; Neubauer, L.; Stewart, R.; Roberts, A.","Concerns have been raised over the experiences of violence such as domestic violence (DV) and intimate partner violence (IPV) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Social media such as Reddit represent an alternative outlet for reporting experiences of violence where healthcare access has been limited. This study analyzed seven violence-related subreddits to investigate the trends of different violence patterns from January 2018 to February 2022 to enhance the health-service providers’ existing service or provide some new perspective for existing violence research. Specifically, we collected violence-related texts from Reddit using keyword searching and identified six major types with supervised machine learning classifiers: DV, IPV, physical violence, sexual violence, emotional violence, and nonspecific violence or others. The increase rate (IR) of each violence type was calculated and temporally compared in five phases of the pandemic. The phases include one pre-pandemic phase (Phase 0, the date before February 26, 2020) and four pandemic phases (Phases 1–4) with separation dates of June 17, 2020, September 7, 2020, and June 4, 2021. We found that the number of IPV-related posts increased most in the earliest phase; however, that for COVID-citing IPV was highest in the mid-pandemic phase. IRs for DV, IPV, and emotional violence also showed increases across all pandemic phases, with IRs of 26.9%, 58.8%, and 28.8%, respectively, from the pre-pandemic to the first pandemic phase. In the other three pandemic phases, all the IRs for these three types of violence were positive, though lower than the IRs in the first pandemic phase.

Personality Detection using Kernel-based Ensemble Model for Leveraging Social Psychology in Online Networks,"Kumar, A.; Beniwal, R.; Jain, D.","The Asian social networking market dominates the world landscape with the highest consumer penetration rate. Businesses and investors often look for winning strategies to attract consumers to increase revenues from sales, advertisements, and other services offered on social media platforms. Social media engagement and online relational cohesion have often been defined within the frameworks of social psychology and personality identification is a possible way in which social psychology can inform, engage, and learn from social media. Personality profiling has many real-world applications, including preference-based recommendation systems, relationship building, and career counseling. This research puts forward a novel kernel-based soft-voting ensemble model for personality detection from natural language, KBSVE-P. The KBSVE-P model is built by first evaluating the performance of various Support Vector Machine (SVM) kernels, namely radial basis function (RBF), linear, sigmoidal, and polynomial, to find the best-suited kernel for automatic personality detection in natural language text. Next, an ensemble of SVM kernels is implemented with a variety of voting techniques, such as soft voting, hard voting, and weighted hard voting. The model is evaluated on the publicly available Kaggle_MBTI dataset and a novel South Asian, Indian, low-resource Hindi language _MBTI (pronounced as vishesh charitr, meaning personality in Hindi) dataset for detecting a user's personality across four personality traits, namely introvert/extrovert (IE), thinking/feeling (TF), sensing/intuitive (SI), and judging/perceiving (JP).

A Contemporarymulti-Objective Feature Selection Model for Depression Detection Using a Hybrid pBGSK Optimization Algorithm,"Kavi Priya, S.; Pon Karthika, K.","Depression is one of the primary causes of global mental illnesses and an underlying reason for suicide. The user generated text content available in social media forums offers an opportunity to build automatic and reliable depression detection models. The core objective of this work is to select an optimal set of features that may help in classifying depressive contents posted on social media. To this end, a novel multi-objective feature selection technique (EFS-pBGSK) and machine learning algorithms are employed to train the proposed model. The novel feature selection technique incorporates a binary gaining-sharing knowledge-based optimization algorithm with population reduction (pBGSK) to obtain the optimized features from the original feature space. The extensive feature selector (EFS) is used to filter out the excessive features based on their ranking. Two text depression datasets collected from Twitter and Reddit forums are used for the evaluation of the proposed feature selection model.

Mind the gap: Exploring differences in suicide literacy between cybersuicide and offline suicide,"Li, A.; Jiao, D.","Introduction: The highly public nature of cybersuicide contradicts long-held beliefs of offline suicide, which may cause differences in the way people perceive and respond to both of them. However, knowledge of whether and how suicide literacy differs between cybersuicide and offline suicide is limited. Methods: By analyzing social media data, this paper focused on livestreamed suicide and aimed to compare suicide literacy between cybersuicide and offline suicide on three aspects, including false knowledge structure, extent of association with stigma, and linguistic expression pattern. 7,236 Sina Weibo posts with relevant keywords were downloaded and analyzed. First, a content analysis was performed by human coders to determine whether each post reflected suicide-related false knowledge and stigma. Second, a text analysis was conducted using the Simplified Chinese version of LIWC software to automatically extract psycholinguistic features from each post. Third, based on selected features, classification models were developed using machine learning techniques to differentiate false knowledge of cybersuicide from that of offline suicide. Results: Results showed that, first, cybersuicide-related posts generally reflected more false knowledge than offline suicide-related posts ((Formula presented.) 255.13, p < 0.001). Significant differences were also observed in seven false knowledge types. Second, among posts reflecting false knowledge, cybersuicide-related posts generally carried more stigma than offline suicide-related posts ((Formula presented.) = 116.77, p < 0.001). Significant differences were also observed in three false knowledge types. Third, among established classification models, the highest F1 value reached 0.70.

Enhanced Labeling Technique for Reddit Text and Fine-Tuned Longformer Models for Classifying Depression Severity in English and Luganda,"Kimera, R.; Rim, D.N.; Kirabira, J.; Udomah, U.G.; Choi, H.","Depression is a global burden and one of the most challenging mental health conditions to control. Using the BDI questionnaire, experts can detect its severity early, administer appropriate medication to patients, and impede its progression. Owing to the fear of potential stigmatization, many patients turn to social media platforms such as Reddit for advice and assistance at various stages of their journey. This research extracts text from Reddit to facilitate the diagnostic process, employs a proposed labelling approach to categorize the text, and subsequently fine-tunes the Longformer model. The model's performance is compared against the baseline models, including Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Gradient Boosting.

Extracting Mental Health Indicators From English and Spanish Social Media: A Machine Learning Approach,"Villa-Perez, M.E.; Trejo, L.A.; Moin, M.B.; Stroulia, E.","This study examines the communications of English- and Spanish-speaking Twitter users through traditional and deep learning algorithms to automatically recognize whether they live with one of nine mental health conditions. We created two datasets in English and Spanish. The 'diagnosed' set comprises the timeline of 1,500 users who explicitly reported in one or more of their posts having been diagnosed with one of the following: ADHD, Anxiety, Autism, Bipolar, Depression, Eating disorders, OCD, PTSD, and Schizophrenia. The 'control' set comprises the timeline of 1,700 randomly selected users who had not disclosed a diagnosis. We extracted a variety of text features from the collected data, such as n-grams, q-grams, Part-of-speech (POS) tags, topic modeling, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), and word embeddings, and trained traditional machine-learning and deep learning classifiers for two tasks: binary classification, to distinguish between diagnosed and non-diagnosed users, and multiclass classification, to identify the specific diagnosis. Overall, XGBoost and convolutional neural network (CNN) performed the best in the two classification tasks. Moreover, lexical attributes based on n-grams and q-grams are the ones that performed well in both datasets. Using our collected datasets, for binary classification, we achieved an AUC of 0.835 on the Spanish Twitter dataset using n-grams of words from one to three (UBT) and 0.846 on the English Twitter dataset with a 5-gram characters (C5) model.

Automatic Bipolar Disorder Assessment Using Machine Learning With Smartphone-Based Digital Phenotyping,"Wu, C.-H.; Hsu, J.-H.; Liou, C.-R.; Su, H.-Y.; Lin, E.C.-L.; Chen, P.-S.","Bipolar disorder (BD) is one of the most common mental illnesses worldwide. In this study, a smartphone application was developed to collect digital phenotyping data of users, and an ensemble method combining the results from a model pool was established through heterogeneous digital phenotyping. The aim was to predict the severity of bipolar symptoms by using two clinician-administered scales, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). The collected digital phenotype data included the user's location information (GPS), self-report scales, daily mood, sleep patterns, and multimedia records (text, speech, and video). Each category of digital phenotype data was used for training models and predicting the rating scale scores (HAM-D and YMRS). Seven models were tested and compared, and different combinations of feature types were used to evaluate the performance of heterogeneous data. To address missing data, an ensemble approach was employed to increase flexibility in rating scale score prediction. This study collected heterogeneous digital phenotype data from 84 individuals with BD and 11 healthy controls. Five-fold cross-validation was employed for evaluation. The experimental results revealed that the Lasso and ElasticNet regression models were the most effective in predicting rating scale scores, and heterogeneous data performed better than homogeneous data, with a mean absolute error of 1.36 and 0.55 for HAM-D and YMRS, respectively; this margin of error meets medical requirements. © 2013 IEEE.",2023,,IEEE Access,11,,121845-121858,,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3328342,,#10760,Wu 2023,"",""
A NEW ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE-BASED CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR DIAGNOSIS OF MAJOR PSYCHIATRIC DISEASES BASED ON VOICE ANALYSIS,"Cansel, N.; Alcin, Ö.F.; Yılmaz, Ö.F.; Ari, A.; Akan, M.; Ucuz, İ.","Background: Speech features are essential components of psychiatric examinations, serving as important markers in the recognition and monitoring of mental illnesses. This study aims to develop a new clinical decision support system based on artificial intelligence, utilizing speech signals to distinguish between bipolar, depressive, anxiety and schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Subjects and methods: A total of 79 patients, who were admitted to the psychiatry clinic between 2020-2021, including 15 with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, 24 with anxiety disorders, 25 with depressive disorders, and 15 with bipolar affective disorder, alongside with 25 healthy individuals were included in the study. The speech signal dataset was created by recording participants’ readings of two texts determined by the Russell emotion model. The number of speech samples was increased by using random sampling in speech signals. The sample audio signals were decomposed into time-frequency coeﬃcients using Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT). Feature extraction was performed using each coeﬃcient obtained from both Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coeﬃcients (MFCC) and Gammatone Cepstral Coeﬃcient (GTCC) methods. The disorder classification was carried out using k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. Results: The success rate of the developed model in distinguishing the disorders was 96.943%. While the kNN model exhibited the highest performance in diagnosing bipolar disorder, it performed the least effectively in detecting depressive disorders. Whereas, the SVM model demonstrated close and high performance in detecting anxiety and psychosis, but its performance was low in identifying bipolar disorder. The findings support the utilization of speech analysis for distinguishing major psychiatric disorders.

Smart Mental Chatbot Platform in the Media and Cognition Course,"Yang, Y.; Zhao, X.","The media and cognition course has evolved over ten years and is still keeping pace with the latest developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning. In order to promote this course, the teaching group specially launched one python programming course in the first year of college to help freshmen use python as a tool more proficiently, and combine their interests in the subsequent media and cognition course to propose their more attractive and innovative ideas. This process is also known as the interest-based teaching method. With the development of interest-based teaching method, more students can find interesting problems or difficulties in their study and life, and try to solve them with various intelligent means taught in the course of media and cognition. In the latest course, students independently propose a diagnostic technique for teenagers’ psychological anxiety based on image cognition. In the class, the students developed one anxiety diagnosis chatbot system for teenagers to self-test their anxious level. Based on the user’s description and cognition of the image, the user’s language and text analysis and entity extraction are used to determine the severity of their psychological problems and analyze the causes of their anxiety and stress. The topics proposed in this paper reflect the recent development of artificial intelligence and psychology shown in this course.

Psychological Study of Cyber-Bullying Against Adolescent Girls in India Using Twitter,"Sharma, K.; Singh, K.K.","Due to the rise in digital activity of students as well as increased social media presence, the lack of regulation of platforms has given rise to another form of bullying, popularly known as cyberbullying. Cyberbullying is one of the most adverse issues prevalent in schools nationwide. Cyberbullying refers to bullying that happens over any web-interfaced or electronic platform. It is an activity that significantly affects the mental and physical health of its victims. With increased secrecy, the frequency and propagation of cyberbullying remain high due to the information technology infrastructure available today. Understanding cyberbullying trends and preventing them, using suitable machine learning algorithms, could help numerous school students lead better lives, as well as make better decisions, which help them grow and flourish into capable future leaders. Hence, the authors’ aim for this research paper is to focus on adolescent girls using various tools and techniques like text analytics and image analytics. For this paper, the authors study a sample of netizens. The location where the analysis is conducted is New Delhi, and the real-world data is extracted from Twitter in English. The real-world data is extracted using appropriate data mining algorithms to find hidden patterns and then conduct the analyses required to understand the psychology of girls and boys and the tonality and voice of the tweets/posts. This is done from the open-source information available on the platform (Twitter) from tweets by the users. There is little to no bias as the entire process can be automated; hence, tweets will be filtered or flagged based on data. Such a method allows one to get access to unbiased data. Bias, in this case, can be defined as prejudice in action and response received from a participant. The results are then analysed using polarity and subjectivity. Understanding psychology and personality traits helps in drawing insights from the expressions collected. The authors will be studying the sample bios, likes, and comments of the sample using a lexical and syntactical approach. Six thousand top tweets are extracted, and the 15 tweets which score the highest on polarity and subjectivity values are taken for further analysis. The tweets are filtered based on 16 responses from a focus group filtering the 20 most popular profane words. Since the data is extracted using Twitter (i.e., a secondary data source), the authors address the gap in current psychological analyses. In such studies, one usually circulates questionnaires to understand the participant, but, for this research though, the authors will be studying the data without bringing the concerned individual into play, thereby eliminating the human bias, which is a significant limitation of gathering responses through a questionnaire. There is increased scope for further streamlining the model. The inferences include understanding the regulation of a social media platform, the degree of aggression on the platform, and an effort to distinguish those who cause such aggression. © 2023 IGI Global.

Bidirectional Long-Short-Term Memory with Attention Mechanism for Emotion Analysis in Textual Content,"Omarov, B.; Zhumanov, Z.","Emotion analysis in textual content plays a crucial role in various applications, including sentiment analysis, customer feedback monitoring, and mental health assessment. Traditional machine learning and deep learning techniques have been employed to analyze emotions; however, these methods often fail to capture complex and long-range dependencies in text. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel bidirectional long-short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) model for emotion analysis in textual content. The proposed Bi-LSTM model leverages the power of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to capture both the past and future context of text, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the emotional content. By integrating the forward and backward LSTM layers, the model effectively learns the semantic representations of words and their dependencies in a sentence. Additionally, we introduce an attention mechanism to weigh the importance of different words in the sentence, further improving the model's interpretability and performance. To evaluate the effectiveness of our Bi-LSTM model, we conduct extensive experiments on Kaggle Emotion detection dataset. The results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms several state-of-the-art baseline methods, including traditional machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines and naive Bayes, as well as other deep learning approaches, like CNNs and vanilla LSTMs. © 2023, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

Identifying Targeted and Generalized Offensive Speech from Anti-asian Social Media Conversations,"Shah, P.; Gokhale, S.S.","During the Covid-19 pandemic Asian-Americans have been targets of prejudice and negative stereotyping. There has also been volumes of counter speech condemning this jaundiced attitude. Ironically, however, the dialogue on both sides is filled with offensive and abusive language. While abusive language directed at Asians encourages violence and hate crimes against this ethnic group, the use of derogatory language to insult alternative points of view showcases utter lack of respect and exploits people’s fears to stir up social tensions. It is thus important to identify and demote both types of offensive content from anti-Asian social media conversations. The goal of this paper is to present a machine learning framework that can achieve the dual objective of detecting targeted anti-Asian bigotry as well as generalized offensive content. Tweets were collected using the hashtag #chinavirus. Each tweet was annotated in two ways; either it condemned or condoned anti-Asian bias, and whether it was offensive or non-offensive. A rich set of features both from the text and accompanying numerical data were extracted. These features were used to train conventional machine learning and deep learning models. Our results show that the Random Forest classifier can detect both generalized and targeted offensive content with around 0.88 accuracy and F1-score. Our results are promising from two perspectives. First, our approach outperforms contemporary efforts on detecting online abuse against Asian-Americans. Second, our unified approach detects both offensive speech targeted specifically at Asian-Americans and also identifies its generalized form which has the potential to mobilize a large number of people in socially challenging situations. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2023,,Lect.

Predicting and Curing Depression Using Long Short Term Memory and Global Vector,"Kumar, A.; Md, A.Q.; Jackson, J.C.; Iwendi, C.","In today's world, there are many people suffering from mental health problems such as depression and anxiety. If these conditions are not identified and treated early, they can get worse quickly and have far-reaching negative effects.

Identification of intimate partner violence from free text descriptions in social media,"Trinh Ha, P.; D’Silva, R.; Chen, E.; Koyutürk, M.; Karakurt, G.","Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant public health problem that adversely affects the well-being of victims. IPV is often under-reported and non-physical forms of violence may not be recognized as IPV, even by victims. With the increasing popularity of social media and due to the anonymity provided by some of these platforms, people feel comfortable sharing descriptions of their relationship problems in social media. The content generated in these platforms can be useful in identifying IPV and characterizing the prevalence, causes, consequences, and correlates of IPV in broad populations. However, these descriptions are in the form of free text and no corpus of labeled data is available to perform large-scale computational and statistical analyses. Here, we use data from established questionnaires that are used to collect self-report data on IPV to train machine learning models to predict IPV from free text. Using Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) along with multiple machine learning algorithms (random forest, SVM, logistic regression, Naïve Bayes), we develop DetectIPV, a tool for detecting IPV in free text. Using DetectIPV, we comprehensively characterize the predictability of different types of violence (physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse) from free text. Our results show that a general model that is trained using examples of all violence types can identify IPV from free text with area under the ROC curve (AUROC) 89%. We also train type-specific models and observe that physical abuse can be identified with greatest accuracy (AUROC 98%), while sexual abuse can be identified with high precision but relatively low recall. While our results indicate that the prediction of emotional abuse is the most challenging, DetectIPV can identify emotional abuse with AUROC above 80%. These results establish DetectIPV as a tool that can be used to reliably detect IPV in the context of various applications, ranging from flagging social media posts to detecting IPV in large text corpuses for research purposes.

Proactive depression detection from Facebook text and behavior data,"Hemtanon, S.; Aekwarangkoon, S.; Kittiphattanabawon, N.","This paper proposes a proactive method to detect the clinical depression affected person from post and behavior data from Facebook, called text-based and behavior-based models, respectively. For a text-based model, the words that make up the posts are separated and converted into vectors of terms. A machine learning classification applies the term frequency- inverse document frequency technique to identify important or rare words in the posts. For the behavior-based model, the statistical values of the behavioral data were designed to capture depressive symptoms. The results showed that the behavior-based model was able to detect depressive symptoms better than the text-based model. Regarding performance, a detection model using behaviors yields significantly higher F1 scores than those using words in the post. The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier is the best model with the highest F1 score of 1.0, while the highest F1 score of the behavior-based model is 0.88.

An Application to Detect Cyberbullying Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques,"Raj, M.; Singh, S.; Solanki, K.; Selvanambi, R.","Nowadays, a lot of people indulge themselves in the world of social media. With the current pandemic scenario, this engagement has only increased as people often rely on social media platforms to express their emotions, find comfort, find like-minded individuals, and form communities. With this extensive use of social media comes many downsides and one of the downsides is cyberbully. Cyberbullying is a form of online harassment that is both unsettling and troubling. It can take many forms, but the most common is a textual format. Cyberbullying is common on social media, and people often end up in a mental breakdown state instead of taking action against the bully. On the majority of social networks, automated detection of these situations necessitates the use of intelligent systems. We have proposed a cyberbullying detection system to address this issue. In this work, we proposed a deep learning framework that will evaluate real-time twitter tweets or social media posts as well as correctly identify any cyberbullying content in them. Recent studies has shown that deep neural network-based approaches are more effective than conventional techniques at detecting cyberbullying texts. Additionally, our application can recognise cyberbullying posts which were written in English, Hindi, and Hinglish (Multilingual data). © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",2022,,SN COMPUT.

Classifications of Restricted Web Streaming Contents based on Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-term Memory (CNN-LSTM),"Choi, J.; Zhang, X.","The development of social media is beneficial for users to quickly access various types of information online. However, this can be a risky for teenagers under the age of 18 years because they may become exposed to information that is unsuitable for them. Some social media platforms have established age-restricted content policies to prevent teenagers from being exposed to bad information. However, unsuitable content that has not been marked as age-restricted still exists online as a result of the enormous volume of information provided on the Internet and the inability to identify it immediately, among other factors. It is important to classify restricted and unrestricted content to protect teenagers’ online safety because teenagers are more likely to be negatively affected by biased and harmful content than adults are. We suggest a strategy for classifying restricted and unrestricted content in this study by examining content comments. We collected and cleaned comments obtained from two datasets (each containing restricted and unrestricted content comments, respectively) from YouTube. Word2vec was used to display comments as vectors, and the classifier was established using convolutional neural network and long short-term memory.

Abusive comment identification on Indonesian social media data using hybrid deep learning,"Sari, T.I.; Ardilla, Z.N.; Hayatin, N.; Maskat, R.","Half of the entire social media users in Indonesia has experienced cyberbullying. Cyberbullying is one of the treatments received as an attack with abusive words. An abusive word is a word or phrase that contained harassment and is expressed be it spoken or in the form of text. This is a serious problem that must be controlled because the act has an impact on the victim's psychology and causes trauma resulting in depression. This study proposed to identify abusive comments from social media in Indonesian language using a deep learning approach. The architecture used is a hybrid model, a combination between recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM). RNN can map the input sequences to fixed-size vectors on hidden vector components and LSTM implemented to overcome gradient vector growth components that have the potential to exist in RNN.

Harnessing emotions for depression detection,"Prabhu, S.; Mittal, H.; Varagani, R.; Jha, S.; Singh, S.","Human emotions using textual cues, speech patterns, and facial expressions can give insight into their mental state. Although there are several uni-modal datasets for emotion recognition, there are very few labeled datasets for multi-modal depression detection. Uni-modal emotion recognition datasets can be harnessed, using the technique of transfer learning, for multi-modal binary emotion detection through video, audio, and text. We propose emotion transfer for mood indication framework based on deep learning to address the task of binary classification of depression using a one-of-three scheme: If the prediction from the network for at least one modality is of the depressed class, we consider the final output as depressed. Such a scheme is beneficial since it will detect an abnormality in any of the modalities and will alert a user to seek help well in advance. Long short-term memory is used to combine the temporal aspects of the audio and the video modalities, and the context of the text. This is followed by fine-tuning the network on a binary dataset for depression detection that has been independently labeled by a standard questionnaire used by psychologists. Data augmentation techniques are used for the generalization of data and to resolve the class imbalance.

With traditional screening questionnaires too burdensome to achieve universal screening in this population, data collected through mobile applications has the potential to rapidly identify at-risk students. While prior research has mostly focused on collecting passive smartphone modalities from students, smartphone sensors are also capable of capturing active modalities. The general public has demonstrated more willingness to share active than passive modalities through an app, yet no such dataset of active mobile modalities for mental illness screening exists for students. Knowing which active modalities hold strong screening capabilities for student populations is critical for developing targeted mental illness screening technology.

Deep Learning for Depression Detection from Textual Data,"Amanat, A.; Rizwan, M.; Javed, A.R.; Abdelhaq, M.; Alsaqour, R.; Pandya, S.; Uddin, M.","Depression is a prevalent sickness, spreading worldwide with potentially serious impli-cations. Timely recognition of emotional responses plays a pivotal function at present, with the profound expansion of social media and users of the internet. Mental illnesses are highly hazardous, stirring more than three hundred million people. Moreover, that is why research is focused on this subject. With the advancements of machine learning and the availability of sample data relevant to depression, there is the possibility of developing an early depression diagnostic system, which is key to lessening the number of afflicted individuals.

Vocal Acoustic Features as Potential Biomarkers for Identifying/Diagnosing Depression: A Cross-Sectional Study,"Zhao, Q.; Fan, H.-Z.; Li, Y.-L.; Liu, L.; Wu, Y.-X.; Zhao, Y.-L.; Tian, Z.-X.; Wang, Z.-R.; Tan, Y.-L.; Tan, S.-P.","Background: At present, there is no established biomarker for the diagnosis of depression. Meanwhile, studies show that acoustic features convey emotional information. Therefore, this study explored differences in acoustic characteristics between depressed patients and healthy individuals to investigate whether these characteristics can identify depression. Methods: Participants included 71 patients diagnosed with depression from a regional hospital in Beijing, China, and 62 normal controls from within the greater community. We assessed the clinical symptoms of depression of all participants using the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and recorded the voice of each participant as they read positive, neutral, and negative texts. OpenSMILE was used to analyze their voice acoustics and extract acoustic characteristics from the recordings. Results: There were significant differences between the depression and control groups in all acoustic characteristics (p < 0.05). Several mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), including MFCC2, MFCC3, MFCC8, and MFCC9, differed significantly between different emotion tasks; MFCC4 and MFCC7 correlated positively with PHQ-9 scores, and correlations were stable in all emotion tasks. The zero-crossing rate in positive emotion correlated positively with HAMA total score and HAMA somatic anxiety score (r = 0.31, r = 0.34, respectively), and MFCC9 of neutral emotion correlated negatively with HAMD anxiety/somatization scores (r = −0.34). Linear regression showed that the MFCC7-negative was predictive on the PHQ-9 score (β = 0.90, p = 0.01) and MFCC9-neutral was predictive on HAMD anxiety/somatization score (β = −0.45, p = 0.049). Logistic regression showed a superior discriminant effect, with a discrimination accuracy of 89.66%. Conclusion: The acoustic expression of emotion among patients with depression differs from that of normal controls. Some acoustic characteristics are related to the severity of depressive symptoms and may be objective biomarkers of depression. A systematic method of assessing vocal acoustic characteristics could provide an accurate and discreet means of screening for depression; this method may be used instead of—or in conjunction with—traditional screening methods, as it is not subject to the limitations associated with self-reported assessments wherein subjects may be inclined to provide socially acceptable responses rather than being truthful.

A STACKED ENSEMBLE TECHNIQUE WITH GLOVE EMBEDDING MODEL FOR DEPRESSION DETECTION FROM TWEETS,"Reseena Mol, N.A.; Veni, S.","With the increasing volume of web content on social network sites like Facebook, Twitter, etc. identifying the attitude of people becomes an easy task. That attitude can be used as an input to find the mental status of that person through their texts. According to WHO, depression is a general mental disorder, which has already affected more than 264 million people. With the help of sentiment analysis, it is possible to detect depression at an early stage from their tweets as they represent their attitude. Machine Learning Classification algorithms help to classify the texts as Depressed or non-depressed, but their accuracy is limited when researchers are using only traditional Bag of Words vectorizers to extract features. Instead of this, word embedding models can be used which represent words as real-valued vectors in a distinct vector space that is already defined and provides better accuracy. In this paper, we try to implement eight machine learning techniques for depression detection from tweets namely SVM, Logistic Regression, ExtraTree, Bagging, Random Forest, AdaBoost, XG boosting, and Gradient Boosting which employs different word embeddings like Word2Vec, FastText, and Glove on the dataset which is used to train the classifiers and performed a comparative evaluation of word embedding models with different classifiers.

Developmental Trend of Subjective Well-Being of Weibo Users During COVID-19: Online Text Analysis Based on Machine Learning Method,"Han, Y.; Pan, W.; Li, J.; Zhang, T.; Zhang, Q.; Zhang, E.","Currently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic experienced by the international community has increased the usage frequency of borderless, highly personalized social media platforms of all age groups. Analyzing and modeling texts sent through social media online can reveal the characteristics of the psychological dynamic state and living conditions of social media users during the pandemic more extensively and comprehensively. This study selects the Sina Weibo platform, which is highly popular in China and analyzes the subjective well-being (SWB) of Weibo users during the COVID-19 pandemic in combination with the machine learning classification algorithm. The study first invokes the SWB classification model to classify the SWB level of original texts released by 1,322 Weibo active users during the COVID-19 pandemic and then combines the latent growth curve model (LGCM) and the latent growth mixture model (LGMM) to investigate the developmental trend and heterogeneity characteristics of the SWB of Weibo users after the COVID-19 outbreak. The results present a downward trend and then an upward trend of the SWB of Weibo users during the pandemic as a whole. There was a significant correlation between the initial state and the development rate of the SWB after the COVID-19 outbreak (r = 0.36, p < 0.001). LGMM results show that there were two heterogeneous classes of the SWB after the COVID-19 outbreak, and the development rate of the SWB of the two classes was significantly different. The larger class (normal growth group; n = 1,229, 93.7%) showed a slow growth, while the smaller class (high growth group; n = 93, 6.3%) showed a rapid growth. Furthermore, the slope means across the two classes were significantly different (p < 0.001). Therefore, the individuals with a higher growth rate of SWB exhibited stronger adaptability to the changes in their living environments.

CYBERBULLYING DETECTION USING WORD EMBEDDING FAST TEXT,"Rahayu, C.; Lucky, H.; Suhartono, D.","Cyberbullying is a threat to the mental health of young people that are grow-ing along with advances in technology. In addition, social media can also have a negative impact by posting cruel writings or making arbitrary comments without thinking about the consequences on others. This is what makes one of the occurrences of violence in cy-berspace which is often called cyberbullying. Various methods have been proposed to detect cyberbullying, one of which is machine learning technology, and many studies have been carried out to overcome this problem. However, cyberbullying detection solutions still face challenges, such as cyberbullying datasets which are still difficult to obtain and have low accuracy. The purpose of this study is to build a cyberbullying detection model with optimal accuracy in identifying cyberbully conversations using word embedding. This study introduces the use of the recently released FastText word embedding as a repetition of the word to perform sentiment analysis and cyberbullying tasks.

Machine Learning Approach to Detect Depression Using Social Media Posts,"Saha, S.; Thakur, S.K.; Ponmagal, R.S.","Depression is a common cause of global impairment and can lead to suicide in the worst-case scenario. It has been observed to affect a person’s language of communication as well as their facial expressions. People have taken to sharing their feelings and sentiments on social media sites since its introduction in the last decade. This has provided a unique opportunity for researchers to study their interactions on these platforms and infer whether the users display signs of depression or not. This paper utilizes the Twitter platform and analyzes text posts using bag of words, term frequency–inverse document frequency, and Naive Bayes algorithm, and profile pictures using convolutional neural networks. Additionally, profile pictures containing quotes or words are first subjected to optical character recognition (OCR) to convert them into a text format so that they can be analyzed using BOW and TF-IDF. The study yields a combined result based on the analysis of both text posts and profile pictures, which can better guide the users toward seeking professional medical counsel. Unlike current systems which either focus on text or images posted by the user, the proposed system focuses on both and thus takes into consideration both facets of social media interaction. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",2022,,Lect.

Determination of the mental state of users of the social network Reddit based on machine learning methods,"Branitskiy, A.A.; Sharma, Y.D.; Kotenko, I.V.; Fedorchenko, E.V.; Krasov, A.V.; Ushakov, I.A.","Introduction: Diagnosing mental illness is a complex process that includes conducting dialogue conversations, analyzing the behavior of the subject and passing specialized tests. The successful solution of this problem can be influenced by both the lack of knowledge and experience of the psychologist, and the presence of contradictory or incomplete initial data on the part of the patient. To eliminate this drawback, expert-based or intelligent systems are being developed. Purpose: Development of a technique for determining the mental state of social network users. Results: Using machine learning methods, a technique has been developed designed to determine the type of a mental state of social network users. The novelty of the proposed technique is in the usage of a two-step text preprocessing procedure and the construction of several sets of features which describe the emotional mood of social network users at the level of the messages published by them. As the initial data, we have used text messages of users of the social network Reddit. There are three stages in the technique: 1) data collection, 2) data preprocessing, 3) post labeling and feature construction. To assess the functioning of a software tool built on the basis of this technique, four indicators were used: accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure. The best results are demonstrated with a One-vs-Rest ensemble using linear support vector machines as basic solvers. Practical relevance: The investigation results can be used in the construction of auxiliary systems that are aimed at supporting decision-making by psychologists in determining mental disorders. © 2022 Saint Petersburg State University of Aerospace Instrumentation.

Alzheimer’s Dementia Recognition Using Multimodal Fusion of Speech and Text Embeddings,"Pandey, S.K.; Shekhawat, H.S.; Bhasin, S.; Jasuja, R.; Prasanna, S.R.M.","Alzheimer’s disease related Dementia (ADRD) compromises the memory, thinking and speech. This neurodegenerative disease severely impacts the cognitive capability and motor skills of affected individuals. ADRD is accompanied by progressive degeneration of the brain tissue, which leads to impairments in the memory formation, and loss of verbal fluency among other adverse physiological manifestations. Cognitive impairment becomes particular evident over time since it overtly alters the communication with repetitive utterances, confusion, filler words, and inability to speak at a normal pace. Most prevailing methodologies for ADRD recognition focus on mental health scores given by clinicians through in-person interviews, which can potentially be influenced by subjective bias of the evaluation. Accordingly, use of alterations in speech as a robust, quantitative indicator of Alzheimer’s progression presents an exciting non-invasive prognostic framework. Recent studies utilizing statistical and deep learning approaches have shown that assessment of ADRD can be effectively done algorithmically, which can serve as an objective companion diagnostic to the clinical assessment. However, the sensitivity and specificity of extant approaches are suboptimal. To this end, we present a multimodal fusion-based framework to leverage discriminative information from both speech and text transcripts. Text transcripts are extracted from speech utterances using the wav2vec2 model. Two fusion approaches are evaluated - score-level fusion and late feature fusion for classifying subjects into AD/Non-AD categories. Experimental appraisal of the fusion approaches on the Interspeech 2021 ADDreSSo Challenge dataset yields promising recognition performance with the added advantage of a simpler architecture, reduced compute load and complexity. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2022,,Lect.

Affective saturation index: A lexical measure of affect,"Gennaro, A.; Carola, V.; Ottaviani, C.; Pesca, C.; Palmieri, A.; Salvatore, S.","Affect plays a major role in the individual’s daily life, driving the sensemaking of experience, psychopathological conditions, social representations of phenomena, and ways of coping with others. The characteristics of affect have been traditionally investigated through physiological, self-report, and behavioral measures. The present article proposes a text-based measure to detect affect intensity: the Affective Saturation Index (ASI). The ASI rationale and the conceptualization of affect are overviewed, and an initial validation study on the ASI’s convergent and concurrent validity is presented. Forty individuals completed a non-clinical semi-structured interview. For each interview transcript, the ASI was esteemed and compared to the individual’s physiological index of propensity to affective arousal (measured by heart rate variability (HRV)); transcript semantic complexity (measured through the Semantic Entropy Index (SEI)); and lexical syntactic complexity (measured through the Flesch–Vacca Index (FVI)). ANOVAs and bi-variate correlations estimated the size of the relationships between indexes and sample characteristics (age, gender), then a set of multiple linear regressions tested the ASI’s association with HRV, the SEI, and the FVI. Results support the ASI construct and criteria validity. The ASI proved able to detect affective saturation in interview transcripts (SEI and FVI, adjusted R2 = 0.428 and adjusted R2 = 0.241, respectively) and the way the text’s affective saturation reflected the intensity of the individual’s affective state (HRV, adjusted R2 = 0.428). In conclusion, although the specificity of the sample (psychology students) limits the findings’ generalizability, the ASI provides the chance to use written texts to measure affect in accordance with a dynamic approach, independent of the spatio-temporal setting in which they were produced. In doing so, the ASI provides a way to empower the empirical analysis of fields such as psychotherapy and social group dynamics. © 2021 Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",2021,,Entropy,23,11,,,10.3390/e23111421,,#12208,Gennaro 2021,"",""
Single and Cross-Disorder Detection for Autism and Schizophrenia,"Wawer, A.; Chojnicka, I.; Okruszek, L.; Sarzynska-Wawer, J.","Detection of mental disorders from textual input is an emerging field for applied machine and deep learning methods. Here, we explore the limits of automated detection of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia (SCZ). We compared the performance of: (1) dedicated diagnostic tools that involve collecting textual data, (2) automated methods applied to the data gathered by these tools, and (3) psychiatrists. Our article tests the effectiveness of several baseline approaches, such as bag of words and dictionary-based vectors, followed by a machine learning model. We employed two more refined Sentic text representations using affective features and concept-level analysis on texts. Further, we applied selected state-of-the-art deep learning methods for text representation and inference, as well as experimented with transfer and zero-shot learning. Finally, we also explored few-shot methods dedicated to low data size scenarios, which is a typical problem for the clinical setting. The best breed of automated methods outperformed human raters (psychiatrists). Cross-dataset approaches turned out to be useful (only from SCZ to ASD) despite different data types. The few-shot learning methods revealed promising results on the SCZ dataset. However, more effort is needed to explore the approaches to efficiently training models, given the very limited amounts of labeled clinical data. Psychiatry is one of the few medical fields in which the diagnosis of most disorders is based on the subjective assessment of a psychiatrist. Therefore, the introduction of objective tools supporting diagnostics seems to be pivotal.

"Dasentimental: Detecting depression, anxiety, and stress in texts via emotional recall, cognitive networks, and machine learning","Fatima, A.; Li, Y.; Hills, T.T.; Stella, M.","Most current affect scales and sentiment analysis on written text focus on quantifying valence/sentiment, the primary dimension of emotion. Distinguishing broader, more complex negative emotions of similar valence is key to evaluating mental health. We propose a semi-supervised machine learning model, DASentimental, to extract depression, anxiety, and stress from written text. We trained DASentimental to identify how N = 200 sequences of recalled emotional words correlate with recallers’ depression, anxiety, and stress from the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21). Using cognitive network science, we modeled every recall list as a bag-of-words (BOW) vector and as a walk over a network representation of semantic memory—in this case, free associations. This weights BOW entries according to their centrality (degree) in semantic memory and informs recalls using semantic network distances, thus embedding recalls in a cognitive representation. This embedding translated into state-of-the-art, cross-validated predictions for depression (R = 0.7), anxiety (R = 0.44), and stress (R = 0.52), equivalent to previous results employing additional human data. Powered by a multilayer perceptron neural network, DASentimental opens the door to probing the semantic organizations of emotional distress. We found that semantic distances between recalls (i.e., walk coverage), was key for estimating depression levels but redundant for anxiety and stress levels. Semantic distances from “fear” boosted anxiety predictions but were redundant when the “sad–happy” dyad was considered. We applied DASentimental to a clinical dataset of 142 suicide notes and found that the predicted depression and anxiety levels (high/low) corresponded to differences in valence and arousal as expected from a circumplex model of affect. We discuss key directions for future research enabled by artificial intelligence detecting stress, anxiety, and depression in texts. © 2021 by the authors.

Deep learning for prediction of depressive symptoms in a large textual dataset,"Uddin, M.Z.; Dysthe, K.K.; Følstad, A.; Brandtzaeg, P.B.","Depression is a common illness worldwide with potentially severe implications. Early identification of depressive symptoms is a crucial first step towards assessment, intervention, and relapse prevention. With an increase in data sets with relevance for depression, and the advancement of machine learning, there is a potential to develop intelligent systems to detect symptoms of depression in written material. This work proposes an efficient approach using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to identify texts describing self-perceived symptoms of depression. The approach is applied on a large dataset from a public online information channel for young people in Norway. The dataset consists of youth’s own text-based questions on this information channel. Features are then provided from a one-hot process on robust features extracted from the reflection of possible symptoms of depression pre-defined by medical and psychological experts. The features are better than conventional approaches, which are mostly based on the word frequencies (i.e., some topmost frequent words are chosen as features from the whole text dataset and applied to model the underlying events in any text message) rather than symptoms. Then, a deep learning approach is applied (i.e., RNN) to train the time-sequential features discriminating texts describing depression symptoms from posts with no such descriptions (non-depression posts). Finally, the trained RNN is used to automatically predict depression posts. The system is compared against conventional approaches where it achieved superior performance than others. The linear discriminant space clearly reveals the robustness of the features by generating better clustering than other traditional features. Besides, since the features are based on the possible symptoms of depression, the system may generate meaningful explanations of the decision from machine learning models using an explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) algorithm called Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME). The proposed depression symptom feature-based approach shows superior performance compared to the traditional general word frequency-based approaches where frequency of the features gets more importance than the specific symptoms of depression. Although the proposed approach is applied on a Norwegian dataset, a similar robust approach can be applied on other depression datasets developed in other languages with proper annotations and symptom-based feature extraction. Thus, the depression prediction approach can be adopted to contribute to develop better mental health care technologies such as intelligent chatbots. © 2021, The Author(s).",2022,,Neural Comput.

This study proposes that the user data available on Twitter has the potential to showcase the contrasting emotions of people residing in a pilgrimage city versus those residing in other, non-pilgrimage areas. We collected the Arabic geolocated tweets of users living in Mecca (holy city) and Riyadh (non-pilgrimage city). The user emotions were classified on the basis of Plutchik’s eight basic emotion categories, Fear, Anger, Sadness, Joy, Surprise, Disgust, Trust, and Anticipation. A new bilingual dictionary, AEELex (Arabic English Emotion Lexicon), was designed to determine emotions derived from user tweets. AEELex has been validated on commonly known and popular lexicons. An emotion analysis revealed that people living in Mecca had more positivity than those residing in Riyadh. Anticipation was the emotion that was dominant or most expressed in both places. However, a larger proportion of users living in Mecca fell under this category. The proposed analysis was an initial attempt toward studying the emotional and behavioral differences between users living in different cities of Saudi Arabia.

Automatic detection of cyberbullying and threatening in Saudi tweets using machine learning,"Alghamdi, D.; Al-Motery, R.; Alma'Abdi, R.; Alzamzami, O.; Babour, A.","Social media has become a major factor in people's lives, which affects their communication and psychological state. The widespread use of social media has formed new types of violence, such as cyberbullying. Manual detection and reporting of violent texts in social media applications are challenging due to the increasing number of social media users and the huge amounts of generated data. Automatic detection of violent texts is language-dependent, and it requires an efficient detection approach, which considers the unique features and structures of a specific language or dialect. Only a few studies have focused on the automatic detection and classification of violent texts in the Arabic Language. This paper aims to build a two-level classifier model for classifying Arabic violent texts. The first level classifies text into violent and non-violent. The second level classifies violent text into either cyberbullying or threatening. The dataset used to build the classifier models is collected from Twitter, using specific keywords and trending hashtags in Saudi Arabia. Supervised machine learning is used to build two classifier models, using two different algorithms, which are Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes (NB).

Social distancing is one such preventive measure. People express their opinions freely through social media platforms like Twitter, which can be shared among other users. The articulated texts from Twitter can be analyzed to find the sentiments of the public concerning social distancing. Objective: To understand and analyze public sentiments towards social distancing as articulated in Twitter textual data. Methods: Twitter data specific to Canada and texts comprising social distancing keywords were extrapolated, followed by utilizing the SentiStrength tool to extricate sentiment polarity of tweet texts. Thereafter, the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was employed for sentiment classification. Evaluation of performance was measured with a confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1 measure. Results: This study resulted in the extraction of a total of 629 tweet texts, of which, 40% of tweets exhibited neutral sentiments, followed by 35% of tweets showed negative sentiments and only 25% of tweets expressed positive sentiments towards social distancing. The SVM algorithm was applied by dissecting the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing data. Performance evaluation resulted in an accuracy of 71%. Upon using tweet texts with only positive and negative sentiment polarity, the accuracy increased to 81%. It was observed that reducing test data by 10% increased the accuracy to 87%.

In this work, we explore the transcriptions of spontaneous speech for dementia recognition and compare the results with several baseline results. We explore two models for dementia recognition: 1) fastText and 2) convolutional neural network (CNN) with a single convolutional layer, to capture the n-gram-based linguistic information from the input sentence. The fastText model uses a bag of bigrams and trigrams along with the input text to capture the local word orderings. In the CNN-based model, we try to capture different n-grams (we use n = 2, 3, 4, 5) present in the text by adapting the kernel sizes to n. In both fastText and CNN architectures, the word embeddings are initialized using pretrained GloVe vectors. We use bagging of 21 models in each of these architectures to arrive at the final model using which the performance on the test data is assessed. The best accuracies achieved with CNN and fastText models on the text data are 79.16 and 83.33%, respectively. The best root mean square errors (RMSE) on the prediction of mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score are 4.38 and 4.28 for CNN and fastText, respectively. The results suggest that the n-gram-based features are worth pursuing, for the task of AD detection. fastText models have competitive results when compared to several baseline methods. Also, fastText models are shallow in nature and have the advantage of being faster in training and evaluation, by several orders of magnitude, compared to deep models. © Copyright © 2021 Meghanani, Anoop and Ramakrishnan.",2021,,Frontier.

The Method of Relational-Situational Analysis of Text in Psychological Research,"Enikolopov, S.N.; Kuznetsova, Y.M.; Osipov, G.S.; Smirnov, I.V.; Chudova, N.V.","Some artificial intelligence methods for reliable identification of personality traits in speech can be useful for upgrade of psycho-diagnostics. Such tools should be developed by psychologists, linguists and computer scientists jointly, and therefore a preliminary special methodology and organization are required. The described in our paper original tool for analyzing written text was created at the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute of National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control of RAS under the guidance of Dr. of Physical and Mathematical Sciences G.S. Osipov in collaboration with the members of Mental Health Research Center, the Institute of the Russian Language of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Perm State University. G.S. Osipov proposed a method of relational-situational analysis of text (RSA) based on the ideas of the communicative grammar of the Russian language by G.A. Zolotova, and this approach is implemented in the tool. Analysis of the text using the tool “RSA Machine” turns it into a set of predicate-role structures that are associated with the specifics of the author's worldview. The RSA machine identifies 127 semantic features and semantic roles, and includes a set of psycholinguistic indicators and data of specially created groups of thematic lexis, extracts a total of 197 indicators from texts. The empirical studies have been conducted and have shown some singularities of texts written by people with certain psychological characteristics (according to psychodiagnostic methods and expert opinion), as well as with a psychiatric status (schizophrenia and clinical depression), and these results can be utilized for diagnosis and monitoring. By using the data that the RSA machine receives for further machine learning, it can adapt and develop according with specific research tasks. © 2021 National Research University Higher School of Economics.

An Attention-Based Mood Controlling Framework for Social Media Users,"Ghosh, T.; Banna, M.H.A.; Angona, T.M.; Nahian, M.J.A.; Uddin, M.N.; Kaiser, M.S.; Mahmud, M.","In this digital age, social media is an essential part of life. People share their moments and emotions through it. Consequently, detecting emotions in their behavior can be an effective way to determine their emotional disposition, which can then be used to control their negative thinking by making them see the positive aspects of the world. This study proposes an emotion detection-based mood control framework that reorganizes social media posts to match the user’s mental state.

Emocnn: Encoding emotional expression from text to word vector and classifying emotions—a case study in thai social network conversation,"Wongpatikaseree, K.; Kaewpitakkun, Y.; Yuenyong, S.; Matsuo, S.; Yomaboot, P.","We present EmoCNN, a collection of specially-trained word embedding layer and convolutional neural network model for the classification of conversational texts into 4 types of emotion. This model is part of a chatbot for depression evaluation. The difficulty in classifying emotion from conversational text is that most word embeddings are trained with emotionally-neutral corpus such as Wikipedia or news articles, where emotional words do not appear very often or at all, and the language style is formal writing. We trained a new word embedding based on the word2vec architecture in an unsupervised manner and then fine-tuned it on soft-labelled data. The data was obtained from mining Twitter using emotion keywords. We show that this emotion word embedding can differentiate between words which have the same polarity and words which have opposite polarity, as well as find similar words with the same polarity, while the standard word embedding cannot. We then used this new embedding as the first layer of EmoCNN that classifies conversational text into the 4 emotions. EmoCNN achieved macro-averaged f1-score of 0.76 over the test set. We compared EmoCNN against three different models: a shallow fully-connected neural network, fine-tuning RoBERTa, and ULMFit.

MAM: A Metaphor-Based Approach for Mental Illness Detection,"Zhang, D.; Shi, N.; Peng, C.; Aziz, A.; Zhao, W.; Xia, F.","Among the most disabling disorders, mental illness is one that affects millions of people across the world. Although a great deal of research has been done to prevent mental disorders, detecting mental illness in potential patients remains a considerable challenge. This paper proposes a novel metaphor-based approach (MAM) to determine whether a social media user has a mental disorder or not by classifying social media texts. We observe that the social media texts posted by people with mental illness often contain many implicit emotions that metaphors can express. Therefore, we extract these texts’ metaphor features as the primary indicator for the text classification task. Our approach firstly proposes a CNN-RNN (Convolution Neural Network - Recurrent Neural Network) framework to enable the representations of long texts. The metaphor features are then applied to the attention mechanism for achieving the metaphorical emotions-based mental illness detection. Subsequently, compared with other works, our approach achieves creative results in the detection of mental illnesses. The recall scores of MAM on depression, anorexia, and suicide detection are the highest, with 0.50, 0.70, and 0.65, respectively.

Depression Detection During the Covid 19 Pandemic by Machine Learning Techniques,"Arora, S.; Malik, A.; Khurana, P.; Batra, I.","Coronavirus disease 2019 is a global pandemic caused by the (SARS-CoV-2) Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. During the outbreak of an infectious disease, the population’s psychological reactions play a crucial role in affecting both the spread of the disease and the occurrence of emotional distress. It is recognized that there are number of techniques and tools which are used to detect the depression. To assess whether the individual is depressed or not, machine learning techniques are used. The course of action is based on texts, images, videos and emoticons etc. Among different techniques, it is analyzed that none of the technique is using the probability method to detect the depression. In probability method, one can create a database, which is a collection of words related to emotions like happiness, sadness and anger etc., The probability would be set for all such words in the database and then it will be calculated by various techniques which shows the level of depression of a person. This paper summarized the findings on the identification of depressive mood disorders, using emotion analysis methods and techniques.

We also generate enhanced word embeddings for binary and multi-class classification tasks dedicated to the detection of these types of posts. Our enhancement method to generate word embeddings focuses on identifying terms that are predictive for a class and aims to move their vector representations close to each other while moving them away from the vectors of terms that are predictive for other classes. Variations of the embeddings are defined and evaluated through predictive tasks, a cosine similarity-based method, and a visual approach. We generate predictive models using variations of our enhanced representations with statistical and deep learning approaches.

Can x2vec save lives? Integrating graph and language embeddings for automatic mental health classification,"Ruch, A.","Graph and language embedding models are becoming commonplace in large scale analyses given their ability to represent complex sparse data densely in low-dimensional space. Integrating these models’ complementary relational and communicative data may be especially helpful if predicting rare events or classifying members of hidden populations—tasks requiring huge and sparse datasets for generalizable analyses. For example, due to social stigma and comorbidities, mental health support groups often form in amorphous online groups. Predicting suicidality among individuals in these settings using standard network analyses is prohibitive due to resource limits (e.g., memory), and adding auxiliary data like text to such models exacerbates complexity- and sparsity-related issues. Here, I show how merging graph and language embedding models (metapath2vec and doc2vec) avoids these limits and extracts unsupervised clustering data without domain expertise or feature engineering. Graph and language distances to a suicide support group have little correlation (ρ < 0.23), implying the two models are not embedding redundant information. When used separately to predict suicidality among individuals, graph and language data generate relatively accurate results (69% and 76%, respectively) but have moderately large false-positive (25% and 21%, respectively) and false-negative (38% and 27%, respectively) rates; however, when integrated, both data produce highly accurate predictions (90%, with 10% false-positives and 12% false-negatives). Visualizing graph embeddings annotated with predictions of potentially suicidal individuals shows the integrated model could classify such individuals even if they are positioned far from the support group. These results extend research on the importance of simultaneously analyzing behavior and language in massive networks and efforts to integrate embedding models for different kinds of data when predicting and classifying, particularly when they involve rare events. © 2020 The Author(s).

We apply a text-based, machine learning prediction model to Facebook status updates to compute weekly trajectories of emotional valence and arousal. We train this model on 2895 human-annotated Facebook statuses and apply the resulting model to 303 575 Facebook statuses posted by 640 US Facebook users who had previously self-reported their Big Five traits, yielding an average of 28 weekly estimates per user. We examine the correlations between model-predicted emotion and self-reported personality, providing a test of the robustness of these links when using weekly aggregated data, rather than momentary data as in prior work. We further present dynamic visualizations of weekly valence and arousal for every user, while making the final data set of 17 937 weeks openly available.

The methodology was developed and externally validated using the largest in the UK secondary care mental health EHR data on a specific task of predicting survival risk of patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. The signature-based model was compared to a common survival random forest model. Our results showed a 15.4% increase of risk prediction AUC at the time point of 20 months after the first admission to a specialist memory clinic and the signature method outperformed the baseline mixed-effects model by 13.2 %. © 2020 Association for Computational Linguistics",2020,,"EMNLP - Int.

Digital biomarkers of social anxiety severity: Digital phenotyping using passive smartphone sensors,"Jacobson, N.C.; Summers, B.; Wilhelm, S.","Background: Social anxiety disorder is a highly prevalent and burdensome condition. Persons with social anxiety frequently avoid seeking physician support and rarely receive treatment. Social anxiety symptoms are frequently underreported and underrecognized, creating a barrier to the accurate assessment of these symptoms. Consequently, more research is needed to identify passive biomarkers of social anxiety symptom severity. Digital phenotyping, the use of passive sensor data to inform health care decisions, offers a possible method of addressing this assessment barrier. Objective: This study aims to determine whether passive sensor data acquired from smartphone data can accurately predict social anxiety symptom severity using a publicly available dataset. Methods: In this study, participants (n=59) completed self-report assessments of their social anxiety symptom severity, depressive symptom severity, positive affect, and negative affect. Next, participants installed an app, which passively collected data about their movement (accelerometers) and social contact (incoming and outgoing calls and texts) over 2 weeks. Afterward, these passive sensor data were used to form digital biomarkers, which were paired with machine learning models to predict participants' social anxiety symptom severity. Results: The results suggested that these passive sensor data could be utilized to accurately predict participants' social anxiety symptom severity (r=0.702 between predicted and observed symptom severity) and demonstrated discriminant validity between depression, negative affect, and positive affect. Conclusions: These results suggest that smartphone sensor data may be utilized to accurately detect social anxiety symptom severity and discriminate social anxiety symptom severity from depressive symptoms, negative affect, and positive affect. © Nicholas C Jacobson, Berta Summers, Sabine Wilhelm.

Utilizing Neural Networks and Linguistic Metadata for Early Detection of Depression Indications in Text Sequences,"Trotzek, M.; Koitka, S.; Friedrich, C.M.","Depression is ranked as the largest contributor to global disability and is also a major reason for suicide. Still, many individuals suffering from forms of depression are not treated for various reasons. Previous studies have shown that depression also has an effect on language usage and that many depressed individuals use social media platforms or the internet in general to get information or discuss their problems. This paper addresses the early detection of depression using machine learning models based on messages on a social platform. In particular, a convolutional neural network based on different word embeddings is evaluated and compared to a classification based on user-level linguistic metadata. An ensemble of both approaches is shown to achieve state-of-the-art results in a current early detection task. Furthermore, the currently popular ERDEERDE score as metric for early detection systems is examined in detail and its drawbacks in the context of shared tasks are illustrated. A slightly modified metric is proposed and compared to the original score. Finally, a new word embedding was trained on a large corpus of the same domain as the described task and is evaluated as well. © 1989-2012 IEEE.",2020,,IEEE Trans Knowl Data Eng,32,3,588-601,,10.1109/TKDE.2018.2885515,,#13168,Trotzek 2020,"",""

An Emotion Analysis Method Using Multi-Channel Convolution Neural Network in Social Networks,"Lu, X.; Zhang, H.","As an interdisciplinary comprehensive subject involving multidisciplinary knowledge, emotional analysis has become a hot topic in psychology, health medicine and computer science. It has a high comprehensive and practical application value. Emotion research based on the social network is a relatively new topic in the field of psychology and medical health research. The text emotion analysis of college students also has an important research significance for the emotional state of students at a certain time or a certain period, so as to understand their normal state, abnormal state and the reason of state change from the information they wrote. In view of the fact that convolutional neural network cannot make full use of the unique emotional information in sentences, and the need to label a large number of high-quality training sets for emotional analysis to improve the accuracy of the model, an emotional analysis model using the emotional dictionary and multichannel convolutional neural network is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the input matrix of emotion dictionary is constructed according to the emotion information, and the different feature information of sentences is combined to form different network input channels, so that the model can learn the emotion information of input sentences from various feature representations in the training process. Then, the loss function is reconstructed to realize the semi supervised learning of the network. Finally, experiments are carried on COAE 2014 and self-built data sets. The proposed model can not only extract more semantic information in emotional text, but also learn the hidden emotional information in emotional text. The experimental results show that the proposed emotion analysis model can achieve a better classification performance. Compared with the best benchmark model gram-CNN, the F1 value can be increased by 0.026 in the self-built data set, and it can be increased by 0.032 in the COAE 2014 data set. © 2020 Tech Science Press.

The Influence of Text Length on Text Classification Model,"Liu, T.; Liang, Y.; Yu, Z.","In this paper, we detect the mental health status of the posters based on social media. Due to the wide range of textual data length in social media, we prove that the length of text input has an effect on the main deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) used in text classification. We argue through three distinct indicators in the English standard dataset and Reddit mental illness dataset, including accuracy, model parameter complexity and time complexity, and set the maximum length of text input on the text classification models by changing the proportion of training/test dataset. As text grows, the accuracy of text classification algorithms also tends to increase, as does the time complexity and model parameter complexity overhead. The shorter maximum length of text results in lower accuracy, while the longer maximum text length leads to higher training costs of algorithms. It allows us to find that the common text classification algorithm models have shown significant influence on the standard English dataset and Reddit mental illness dataset. The length of text or a string, especially for controlling the maximum length of text input on the models separately, puts a strict limit on the text classification algorithm. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",2020,,Commun.

The development of social networks such as Weibo, QQ, and WeChat not only provides more convenient communication methods for college students, but also provides a new emotional vent window for college students. They can record their living conditions in real time through social networks and interact with friends to express emotions and relieve stress. At the same time, the development of social networks has also provided a new way for the detection of depressed users.

Depression is a form of mental illness. Patients suffering from depression have mood disorders such as low mood, high mood, lack of interest in things, etc. Machine learning techniques on text data and emojis have been applied to automatically classify a user into depressed and non-depressed. State-of-the-art classifiers have been used by the researcher to detect depressed individuals. Benchmark datasets are composed of text and emojis used in the social networking websites where classification is based on four factors Emotional Process, Temporal Process, Linguistic Style and combination of these three factors. In the proposed method, the emotional process is combined with their respective emojis to develop an automatic system for the detection of depressed patients.

This study proposes a deep learning framework combining word embeddings, bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM), and convolutional neural networks (CNN) to identify emotion labels from psychiatric social texts. The Bi-LSTM is a powerful mechanism for extracting features from sequential data in which a sentence consists of multiple words in a particular sequence. CNN is another powerful feature extractor which can convolute many blocks to capture important features. Our proposed deep learning framework also applies word representation techniques to represent semantic relationships between words. The paper thus combines two powerful feature extraction methods with word embedding to automatically identify indicators of emotional stress.

Multimodal deep learning based framework for detecting depression and suicidal behaviour by affective analysis of social media posts,"Malhotra, A.; Jindal, R.","INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Currently, no social media platform has deployed a real time system which can analyse users’ state of mind based on day to day posts on continual basis and detect the onset of depression, suicidal or self harming behaviour etc. Platforms majorly rely on manual reporting of suicidal and self harming behavior. In this paper, we propose a real time, deep learning based system for affective analysis of a user’s online social media posts of multimodal nature, with the objective of detecting onset of depression and suicidal or self harming behaviour; as depression often drives people to commit suicide or harm themselves physically. METHODS: Joint representations are obtained by fusing the individual vector representations of multiple modalities from user’s social media feed: text, image and videos. These vector representations are in turn obtained through state of the art approaches for each modality e.g. VGG-16 for feature extraction from images, word2vec for text and Faster R-CNN on video frames. These joint representations are used to obtain weighted average score which can be used for making the final classification using the Softmax prediction layer.

Feature augmenting networks for improving depression severity estimation from speech signals,"Yang, L.; Jiang, D.; Sahli, H.","Depression disorder has become one of the major psychological diseases endangering human health. Researcher in the affective computing community is supporting the development of reliable depression severity estimation system, from multiple modalities (speech, face, text), to assist doctors in their diagnosis. However, the limited amount of annotated data has become the main bottleneck restricting the study on depression screening, especially when deep learning models are used. To alleviate this issue, in this work we propose to use Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) for features augmentation to improve depression severity estimation from speech.

Besides, to measure the quality of the augmented features, we propose three different measurement criteria, characterizing the spatial, frequency and representation learning of the augmented features. Finally, the augmented features are used to train depression estimation models. Experiments are carried out on speech signals from the Audio Visual Emotion Challenge (AVEC2016) depression dataset, and the relationship between the model performance and data size is explored. Our experimental results show that: 1) The combination of the three proposed evaluation criteria can effectively and comprehensively evaluate the quality of the augmented features. 2) When increasing the size of the augmented data, the performance of depression severity estimation gradually improves and the model converges to a certain stable state. 3) The proposed DCGAN based data augmentation approach effectively improves the performance of depression severity estimation, with the root mean square error (RMSE) reduced to 5.520 and mean absolute error (MAE) reduced to 4.634, which is better than most of the state of the art results on AVEC 2016. © 2013 IEEE.",2020,,IEEE Access,8,,24033-24045,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2970496,,#13381,Yang 2020,"",""
Deep learning-based sentimental analysis for large-scale imbalanced twitter data,"Jamal, N.; Xianqiao, C.; Aldabbas, H.","Emotions detection in social media is very effective to measure the mood of people about a specific topic, news, or product. It has a wide range of applications, including identifying psychological conditions such as anxiety or depression in users.

To tackle this issue, this paper presents a hybrid approach of deep learning based on TensorFlow with Keras for emotions detection on a large scale of imbalanced tweets' data. First, preprocessing steps are used to get useful features from raw tweets without noisy data. Second, the entropy weighting method is used to compute the importance of each feature. Third, class balancer is applied to balance each class. Fourth, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to transform high correlated features into normalized forms.

A text classification framework for simple and effective early depression detection over social media streams,"Burdisso, S.G.; Errecalde, M.; Montes-y-Gómez, M.","With the rise of the Internet, there is a growing need to build intelligent systems that are capable of efficiently dealing with early risk detection (ERD) problems on social media, such as early depression detection, early rumor detection or identification of sexual predators. These systems, nowadays mostly based on machine learning techniques, must be able to deal with data streams since users provide their data over time. In addition, these systems must be able to decide when the processed data is sufficient to actually classify users. Moreover, since ERD tasks involve risky decisions by which people's lives could be affected, such systems must also be able to justify their decisions. However, most standard and state-of-the-art supervised machine learning models (such as SVM, MNB, Neural Networks, etc.) are not well suited to deal with this scenario. This is due to the fact that they either act as black boxes or do not support incremental classification/learning. In this paper we introduce SS3, a novel supervised learning model for text classification that naturally supports these aspects. SS3 was designed to be used as a general framework to deal with ERD problems. We evaluated our model on the CLEF's eRisk2017 pilot task on early depression detection.

"Multi-level attention network using text, audio and video for depression prediction","Ray, A.; Kumar, S.; Reddy, R.; Mukherjee, P.; Garg, R.","Depression has been the leading cause of mental-health illness worldwide. Major depressive disorder (MDD), is a common mental health disorder that affects both psychologically as well as physically which could lead to loss of lives. Due to the lack of diagnostic tests and subjectivity involved in detecting depression, there is a growing interest in using behavioural cues to automate depression diagnosis and stage prediction. The absence of labelled behavioural datasets for such problems and the huge amount of variations possible in behaviour makes the problem more challenging. This paper presents a novel multi-level attention based network for multimodal depression prediction that fuses features from audio, video and text modalities while learning the intra and inter modality relevance. The multi-level attention reinforces overall learning by selecting the most influential features within each modality for the decision making. We perform exhaustive experimentation to create different regression models for audio, video and text modalities. Several fusions models with different configurations are constructed to understand the impact of each feature and modality.We outperform the current baseline by 17.52% in terms of root mean squared error. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",2019,,"AVEC - Proc.

Detecting cyberbullying and cyberaggression in social media,"Chatzakou, D.; Leontiadis, I.; Blackburn, J.; De Cristofaro, E.; Stringhini, G.; Vakali, A.; Kourtellis, N.","Cyberbullying and cyberaggression are increasingly worrisome phenomena affecting people across all demographics. More than half of young social media users worldwide have been exposed to such prolonged and/or coordinated digital harassment. Victims can experience a wide range of emotions, with negative consequences such as embarrassment, depression, isolation from other community members, which embed the risk to lead to even more critical consequences, such as suicide attempts. In this work, we take the first concrete steps to understand the characteristics of abusive behavior in Twitter, one of today's largest social media platforms. We analyze 1.2 million users and 2.1 million tweets, comparing users participating in discussions around seemingly normal topics like the NBA, to those more likely to be hate-related, such as the Gamergate controversy, or the gender pay inequality at the BBC station. We also explore specific manifestations of abusive behavior, i.e., cyberbullying and cyberaggression, in one of the hate-related communities (Gamergate). We present a robust methodology to distinguish bullies and aggressors from normal Twitter users by considering text, user, and network-based attributes. Using various state-of-The-Art machine-learning algorithms, we classify these accounts with over 90% accuracy and AUC. Finally, we discuss the current status of Twitter user accounts marked as abusive by our methodology and study the performance of potential mechanisms that can be used by Twitter to suspend users in the future. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

Computing Happiness from Textual Data,"Mohamed, E.; Mostafa, S.A.","In this paper, we use a corpus of about 100,000 happy moments written by people of different genders, marital statuses, parenthood statuses, and ages to explore the following questions: Are there differences between men and women, married and unmarried individuals, parents and non-parents, and people of different age groups in terms of their causes of happiness and how they express happiness? Can gender, marital status, parenthood status and/or age be predicted from textual data expressing happiness? The first question is tackled in two steps: first, we transform the happy moments into a set of topics, lemmas, part of speech sequences, and dependency relations; then, we use each set as predictors in multi-variable binary and multinomial logistic regressions to rank these predictors in terms of their influence on each outcome variable (gender, marital status, parenthood status and age). For the prediction task, we use character, lexical, grammatical, semantic, and syntactic features in a machine learning document classification approach. The classification algorithms used include logistic regression, gradient boosting, and fastText. Our results show that textual data expressing moments of happiness can be quite beneficial in understanding the “causes of happiness” for different social groups, and that social characteristics like gender, marital status, parenthood status, and, to some extent age, can be successfully predicted form such textual data.

Proactive suicide prevention online (PSPO): Machine identification and crisis management for Chinese social media users with suicidal thoughts and behaviors,"Liu, X.; Sun, J.; Yu, N.X.; Sun, B.; Li, Q.; Zhu, T.","Background: Suicide is a great public health challenge. Two hundred million people attempt suicide in China annually. Existing suicide prevention programs require the help-seeking initiative of suicidal individuals, but many of them have a low motivation to seek the required help. We propose that a proactive and targeted suicide prevention strategy can prompt more people with suicidal thoughts and behaviors to seek help. Objective: The goal of the research was to test the feasibility and acceptability of Proactive Suicide Prevention Online (PSPO), a new approach based on social media that combines proactive identification of suicide-prone individuals with specialized crisis management. Methods: We first located a microblog group online. Their comments on a suicide note were analyzed by experts to provide a training set for the machine learning models for suicide identification. The best-performing model was used to automatically identify posts that suggested suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Next, a microblog direct message containing crisis management information, including measures that covered suicide-related issues, depression, help-seeking behavior and an acceptability test, was sent to users who had been identified by the model to be at risk of suicide. For those who replied to the message, trained counselors provided tailored crisis management. The Simplified Chinese Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count was also used to analyze the users' psycholinguistic texts in 1-month time slots prior to and postconsultation. Results: A total of 27,007 comments made in April 2017 were analyzed. Among these, 2786 (10.32%) were classified as indicative of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The performance of the detection model was good, with high precision (.86), recall (.78), F-measure (.86), and accuracy (.88). Between July 3, 2017, and July 3, 2018, we sent out a total of 24,727 direct messages to 12,486 social media users, and 5542 (44.39%) responded. Over one-third of the users who were contacted completed the questionnaires included in the direct message. Of the valid responses, 89.73% (1259/1403) reported suicidal ideation, but more than half (725/1403, 51.67%) reported that they had not sought help. The 9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) mean score was 17.40 (SD 5.98). More than two-thirds of the participants (968/1403, 69.00%) thought the PSPO approach was acceptable. Moreover, 2321 users replied to the direct message. In a comparison of the frequency of word usage in their microblog posts 1-month before and after the consultation, we found that the frequency of death-oriented words significantly declined while the frequency of future-oriented words significantly increased. Conclusions: The PSPO model is suitable for identifying populations that are at risk of suicide. When followed up with proactive crisis management, it may be a useful supplement to existing prevention programs because it has the potential to increase the accessibility of antisuicide information to people with suicidal thoughts and behaviors but a low motivation to seek help. © 2019 Xingyun Liu, Xiaoqian Liu, Jiumo Sun, Nancy Xiaonan Yu, Bingli Sun, Qing Li, Tingshao Zhu.",2019,,J.

Mental Health Assessment for Online Forum Users Based on Multi-Feature Fusion,"Liu, D.-X.; Xia, X.-Y.; Wan, C.-X.; Liu, X.-P.; Jiang, T.-J.; Fu, Q.","Mental health problems cause serious damage to social harmony and family happiness. Early detection of potential patients with mental health problems is conducive to timely counseling and treatment. Internet or social networks are convenient for people to communicate and express their feelings and opinions, which provides an innovative perspective for mental health detecting. We propose F  3TMH, a framework classifying the posts based on multi-feature fusion, to assess the urgency (crisis: very urgent, red: urgent, amber: not urgent, green: no intervention required) of the mental health status of online forum users. Four kinds of features, the behavior&attribute feature of a post or an author, the linguistics feature, the content features (including N-Grams feature, topic feature and word embedding feature), and the context feature of the target posts, are fused by four strategies in F  3TMH, greedy based F  3TMH_G, voting based F  3TMH_V, late fusion based F  3TMH_L and denoising autoencoder based F  3TMH_DA. We examine the performance of various features and different feature fusion strategies on the triage dataset provided by the CLPsych2017 shared task. The experimental results show that the content features perform better than the behavior&attribute feature and the linguistics feature. The word embedding feature based on Word2Vec model has the best performance, where the Non-green F1 score (the mean of crisis F1, red F1 and amber F1) achieved 0.429. Although the behavior & attribute feature of a post or an author does not perform well when use it alone, the crisis F1 decreased by 19.7% if it is removed from F  3TMH_G. Compared with a single feature, multi-feature fusion has a great effect on F  3TMH, which Non-green F1 score (0.479) is 11.6% higher than the best single feature (0.429). Four feature fusion strategies have their own advantages. For instance, F  3TMH_L2 performs better to identify the users with higher mental health crisis (crisis and red posts), which Urgent F1 reached 0.608, whereas F  3TMH_L performs better to identify the crisis posts, and F  3TMH_DA has advantages in identifying Flagged posts (the union of all no green posts), where Flagged F1 is 0.872. Finally, we analysis the effect of the context on mental health assessment for online forum user. Moreover, F  3TMH_V participated in the CLPsych2017 shared task and ranked first with the official metrics Non-green F1 score of 0.467, outperforming other feature engineering based or deep learning based models. © 2019, Science Press.

Using sentiment analysis to detect affect in children’s and adolescents’ poetry,"Hipson, W.E.","Sentiment analysis is a computational method that automatically analyzes the valence of massive quantities of text. Basic sentiment analysis involves extracting and counting emotionally-laden keywords from passages of text (e.g., hate, love, happy, sad). This study describes using sentiment analysis to explore changes in emotion expression in a developmental context. A sample of n = 8,688 poems published online by children and adolescents from Grade 4 to Grade 12 was analyzed. Sentiment analysis coded words as positive or negative and these were averaged within each poem to obtain its relative percentage of positive and negative sentiment. Polynomial regressions explored linear and nonlinear trends in sentiment scores by grade. Among the results, negative sentiment demonstrated an upward curvilinear trend, increasing sharply from Grade 6 to Grade 11 and then decreasing afterward. Positive sentiment demonstrated a sinusoidal pattern throughout development. Overall, these findings are consistent with previous research on the progressions of emotion expression in childhood and adolescence. Despite some limitations, sentiment analysis presents an opportunity for researchers in developmental psychology to explore basic questions in emotional development using large quantities of data. © The Author(s) 2019.",2019,,Int.

"I know how you feel now, and here's why!: Demystifying time-continuous high resolution text-based affect predictions in the wild","Pandit, V.; Schmitt, M.; Cummins, N.; Schuller, B.","Affective computing 'in the wild' is of huge relevance to the healthcare field, like it is for many industries today. Applications of direct relevance are patient monitoring (e.g., emotional state, depression and pain monitoring), health information mining, diagnosis and opinion mining (e.g., from medical reports and drug reviews). The prevalence of the text modality in the medical field for various reasons - e.g., privacy laws, high costs and prohibitory memory requirements for audio and video data - has made the text modality the most popular. Deviating away from traditionally a classification task at a sample-level, the promising baseline results for the Audio/Visual Emotion Challenge (AVEC) 2017 make a strong case for the suitability of text data for a 'time-continuous' affect estimation. For the very first time, we present insights into the inner workings of deep learning, 'in the wild' affect-predicting, time-continuous regression model. We compute relevance of the sparse text-based bag-of-words features (BoTW) of the AVEC 2017 challenge in estimating the three affect labels, viz. arousal, valence and liking, by using a layerwise relevance propagation method(LRP). Interestingly, the trained models are found to rely more on adjectives and adverbs such as 'schlecht', 'gut', 'genau' with positive or negative connotations, and action descriptors such as<laughter> and <slightlaughter> - quite analogous to the human perception of emotion expression. © 2019 IEEE.",2019,,Proc.

Multi-kernel SVM based depression recognition using social media data,"Peng, Z.; Hu, Q.; Dang, J.","Depression has become the world’s fourth major disease. Compared with the high incidence, however, the rate of depression medical treatment is very low because of the difficulty of diagnosis of mental problems.

Thus social media provides a new way to find out the potential depressed people. In this paper, we propose a multi-kernel SVM based model to recognize the depressed people. Three categories of features, user microblog text, user profile and user behaviors, are extracted from their social media to describe users’ situations. According to the new characteristics of social media language, we build a special emotional dictionary consisted of text emotional dictionary and emoticon dictionary to extract microblog text features for word frequency statistics.

Furthermore, with generalizability in mind, we decided to focus our experiments exclusively on textual information as the public availability of audio narratives is limited compared to text. Our hypothesis is that context modeling might provide insights about emotion triggering concepts (e.g. events, people, places) mentioned in the narratives that are linked to an individual's state of mind.

IQ and EQ Enhancement for People with Mental Illness,"El-Seoud, S.A.; Ahmed, S.A.","This paper focuses on IQ and EQ enhancement for people with mental challenges such as Autism, Asparagus syndrome and Down syndrome. People with autism and asparagus syndrome develop a relatively high IQ but below average EQ. On the other hand, people with Down syndrome and intellectual disability have low IQ and relatively high EQ. The system uses speech recognition and detection to listen and understand the user. The application uses text to speech (TTS) in addition to an artificial intelligent chat bot to maintain conversations with the user. Furthermore the system uses image processing to detect users emotions and facial expression. The application uses the methodologies used in several medical institutes and psychiatrist. In addition to IQ and EQ tests that are performed to detect the enhancement of the users IQ and EQ. There are two types of Intellectual disability previously known as mental retardation, namely: mildly mentally retarded (MIMR) and severely mentally retarded (MOMR). Intellectual disability according to IQ is rated by scores. An IQ of 130 and above means Very Intelligent, an IQ of 120–129 indicates intelligent, and an IQ 110–119 indicates High Average, an IQ of 90–109 indicates Average, and an IQ of 80–89 indicates Low Average. An IQ of 70–79 means MIMR and an IQ 69 and lower means MOMR [1]. In Emotional intelligence, the average human rate is from 90 to 110. A person with an IQ below 90 is considered to have low EQ. The main goal of this paper is to help users with below average IQ and EQ to seek normal rates. The developed program uses machine learning, speech recognition, image processing, and best IQ methodologies available to perform an EQ test repeatedly until the user reaches the normal EQ rates. That will allow users with autism to participate in their society and have a normal life. Many parents cannot afford to take their children to a specialist or send them to special schools. Consequently, parents should no longer suffer from self-taking care for their disable kids. In developing countries, children in Orphanages would not be diagnosed for their disability nor would have support from the staff.

We measured the performance of five machine learning algorithms: Prism, Decision Tree, Naï;ve Bayes, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine, in classifying suicide-related text from Twitter. The results of the study showed that the Prism algorithm has outperformed the other machine learning algorithms with an F-measure of 0.84 for the target classes (Suicide and Flippant). This result, to the best of our knowledge, is the highest performance that has been achieved in classifying social media suicide-related text. © 2018 IEEE.",2018,,Proc. Int. Conf. Mach. Learn.

Arousal and valence classification model based on long short-term memory and DEAP data for mental healthcare management,"Choi, E.J.; Kim, D.K.","Objectives: Both the valence and arousal components of affect are important considerations when managing mental healthcare because they are associated with affective and physiological responses. Research on arousal and valence analysis, which uses images, texts, and physiological signals that employ deep learning, is actively underway; research investigating how to improve the recognition rate is needed. The goal of this research was to design a deep learning framework and model to classify arousal and valence, indicating positive and negative degrees of emotion as high or low. Methods: The proposed arousal and valence classification model to analyze the affective state was tested using data from 40 channels provided by a dataset for emotion analysis using electrocardiography (EEG), physiological, and video signals (the DEAP dataset). Experiments were based on 10 selected featured central and peripheral nervous system data points, using long short-term memory (LSTM) as a deep learning method. Results: The arousal and valence were classified and visualized on a two-dimensional coordinate plane. Profiles were designed depending on the number of hidden layers, nodes, and hyperparameters according to the error rate. The experimental results show an arousal and valence classification model accuracy of 74.65 and 78%, respectively. The proposed model performed better than previous other models. Conclusions: The proposed model appears to be effective in analyzing arousal and valence; specifically, it is expected that affective analysis using physiological signals based on LSTM will be possible without manual feature extraction. In a future study, the classification model will be adopted in mental healthcare management systems. © 2018 The Korean Society of Medical Informatics.",2018,,Healthc.

Comparing deep learning and classical machine learning approaches for predicting inpatient violence incidents from clinical text,"Menger, V.; Scheepers, F.; Spruit, M.","Machine learning techniques are increasingly being applied to clinical text that is already captured in the Electronic Health Record for the sake of delivering quality care. Applications for example include predicting patient outcomes, assessing risks, or performing diagnosis. In the past, good results have been obtained using classical techniques, such as bag-of-words features, in combination with statistical models. Recently however Deep Learning techniques, such asWord Embeddings and Recurrent Neural Networks, have shown to possibly have even greater potential. In this work, we apply several Deep Learning and classical machine learning techniques to the task of predicting violence incidents during psychiatric admission using clinical text that is already registered at the start of admission. For this purpose, we use a novel and previously unexplored dataset from the Psychiatry Department of the University Medical Center Utrecht in The Netherlands. Results show that predicting violence incidents with state-of-the-art performance is possible, and that using Deep Learning techniques provides a relatively small but consistent improvement in performance.

Depression recognition based on speech analysis,"Pan, W.; Wang, J.; Liu, T.; Liu, X.; Liu, M.; Hu, B.; Zhu, T.","Depression is one of the common mental diseases. Patients with depression often have depressed moods such as sadness, guilty, low self-esteem, loss of interest, hypofunction and so on. They suffer from serious emotional problems, unexplained suffering, which has caused enormous losses to individuals, families and society. According to the World Health Organization, there are aproximately 322 million people suffering from depression in the whole world in 2017. While there are about 54 million depressive patients in China. Depression can be cured effciently. However, due to the complexity of the pathogenesis of depression, clinical diagnosis is accompanied with many difficulties. Firstly, the mental disease, especially depression, are not getting enough attention and even being misinterpreted by other people. Secondly, the depression patients are less willing to ask for help. Thirdly, it is hard to select and dignose the potential depression patients precisely, as well as there are limited medical resource for depression diagnosis. It is necessary to find a more convenient, objective and efficient way to assist the fast identification of depression. As a relatively objective and easily accessible variable, speech has its potential value. The speech of patient is easy to acquire, and also, it has been proved that the sound of depressed patients have special charcteristics such as slow speech rate, lack of cadence and so on. The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between speech and depression by establishing classification models of voice feature and depression prediction. In this research, 3(emotion mood: positive, neutral, negative)×3(task type: question answering, text reading, picture description) experimental design was employed, and the voice data was collected from the speech of individuals recorded during different tasks. 103 participants were inculded in this study, including 45 depression patients (age: 23.8-44.6, M=34.2, SD=10.4, males=22, females=23) and 58 healthy ones (age: 20.1-41.7, M=30.9, SD=10.8, males=27, females=31). The former were recruited in the hospital in Beijing Anding Hospital and Huilongguan Hospital, while the latter were recruited by advertisement. All of them were diagnosed by specialist with DSM-IV and MINI interview. All participants did not have substance abuse, substance dependence, personality disorders and other mental diseases, no serious physical illness or suicidal behavior. The education level of subjects are all above the elementary school. 988 Voice features were extracted from the speech data using open SMILE software. Logistic regression, a machine learning method, was used to train the predicting models. Results showed that the precision rate of predicting can reach to 82.9%. Based on machine learning methods, this paper employed voice features to establish predicting models of depression. Results show the speech of depression patients has certain predicting effect, which paves the way for the further identification of depression in a more thorough way. © 2018, Science Press.

Erratum: Single-subject anxiety treatment outcome prediction using functional neuroimaging (Neuropsychopharmacology (2014) 39 (1254-1261) DOI: 10.1038/npp.2013.328),"","In this paper, we used a machine-learning algorithm called random forest to predict cognitive behavioral therapy outcomes for adults with generalized anxiety disorder and/ or panic disorder using baseline brain imaging. As reported in the text and Figure 3, activation in largely left lateralized temporal and prefrontal regions during emotion regulation predicted treatment outcome such that individuals with greater activation during cognitive reappraisal showed a better response to 10 weeks of individual cognitive behavioral therapy. In addition to identifying brain regions predictive of outcome, the random forest model also identified symptom metrics, such as overall anxiety severity, anxiety sensitivity, and worry at baseline, as valuable predictors of outcome. However, the random forest procedure also involved testing the accuracy of these predictors for identifying participants who would respond to treatment. We recently learned that this aspect of our random forest procedure was biased toward over-estimating model accuracy because we did not test it on a separate sample. The procedure outlined in Figure 1 remains sound with the caveat that iterations of the process (ie, the upward arrow from Step 3 to Step 1) should be completed on an independent sample. Thus, the accuracy estimates we make of 69%, 79%, and 73% for the clinical, fMRI, and combined models, respectively (see Table 2 and Figure 2) are likely 5-20% higher than one would expect them to be in an independent sample. Our conclusion that symptom severity and brain activation during emotion regulation may combine to predict psychotherapy response remains sound. However, determining the accuracy will require future testing of our model with a separate, independent sample. © 2018 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

Therefore, there is the opportunity for education and training which called the supervision to improve the counseling skill of beginner counselor by expert counselors. However, these documents of the verbatim record in the counseling used in the supervision are large-scale and complex, the expert counselors are very difficult to extract the characteristics and situation of the conversation. As appropriate method to visualize each reaction of the client for each question by beginner counselor, we have developed a system for visualizing the flow of conversation in counseling. However, the expert counselor as the system user requires to correct the initial classification result manually, and the work burden is large, because the accuracy of the category classification of conversation document is very lowin the current system.

User-emotion detection through sentence-based classification using deep learning: A case-study with microblogs in albanian,"Skenduli, M.P.; Biba, M.; Loglisci, C.; Ceci, M.; Malerba, D.","Human emotion analysis has always stimulated studies in different disciplines, such as Cognitive Sciences, Psychology, and thanks to the diffusion of the social media, it is attracting the interests of computer scientists too. Particularly, the growing popularity of Microblogging platforms, has generated large amounts of information which in turn represent an attractive source of data to be further subjected to opinion mining and sentiment analysis. In our research, we leverage the analysis performed on micro-blogging texts and postings in Albanian language, which enables the use of technologies to monitor and follow the feelings and perception of the people with respect to products, issues, events, etc. Our approach to emotion analysis tackles the problem of classifying a text fragment into a set of pre-defined emotion categories and therefore aims at detecting the emotional state of the writer conveyed through the text. In order to achieve this goal, we perform a comparative analysis between different classifiers, using deep learning and other classical machine learning classification algorithms. We also adopt a domestic stemming tool for Albanian language in order to preprocess the datasets used in a second round of experiments. Experimental evaluation shows that deep learning produces overall better results compared with the other methods in terms of classification accuracy.

Relative to the other offenders, psychopaths used more disfluencies (“you know”) and personal pronouns, made fewer references to other people (e.g., personal names, family), and were also less emotionally expressive. In particular, a low frequency of anxiety-related words and a more frequent use of personal pronouns were the most significant predictors of PCL-R scores and accounted for 25% of the variance. These findings for the first time afford a unique glimpse into the language produced during the PCL-R assessment interview.

A text classification for counseling data using topic model,"Shan, Z.; Kato, S.","In order to build a highly efficient psychological counseling system, we provide a text classification method to aid the system in processing the complicated psychological knowledge base. This paper presents a method of text classification, which include LDA, morpheme parse, and majority voting.

We firstly collected three categories of psychological problem texts which are love-related, interpersonal relationship, self-knowledge which are questioned most commonly as training data and texting data. And all of the texts have tags that show their categories. Then we use these data to train LDA to obtain the most usable topic distributions of each category and most usable word distributions of each topic. We use a majority voting method to classify category unknown input with using these topic distributions and word distributions. We also did comparison experiments which were based on TF·IDF and SVM so as to identify the validity of our approach.

Then we define two types of stress-related attributes: 1) low-level content attributes from a single tweet, including text, images and social interactions; 2) user-scope statistical attributes through their weekly micro-blog postings, leveraging information of tweeting time, tweeting types and linguistic styles. To combine content attributes with statistical attributes, we further design a convolutional neural network (CNN) with cross autoencoders to generate user-scope content attributes from low-level content attributes. Finally, we propose a deep neural network (DNN) model to incorporate the two types of userscope attributes to detect users' psychological stress.

The aim of this study was to explore whether the syntactic integration of clauses into narrative in texts written by prospective psychotherapy patients was related to mild to moderate psychological distress. Cross-clausal syntax of texts by 97 people who had contacted a primary care mental health service was analyzed. Severity of symptoms associated with mental health difficulties was assessed by a standardized scale (Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation outcome measure). Cross-clausal syntactic integration was negatively correlated with the severity of symptoms. A multiple regression analysis confirmed that the use of simple sentences, finite complement clauses, and coordinated clauses was associated with symptoms (R 2 =.26).

Discussion: The rule-based system was able to identify most side effects expressed by clear indication words. More sophisticated semantic processing is required to handle complex side effect descriptions in the narrative. We demonstrated that our system can be trained to identify sentences with complex side effect descriptions that can be submitted to a human expert for further abstraction.
